TI PARASITES AND THE ADVANTAGE OF GENETIC-VARIABILITY WITHIN SOCIAL INSECT
   COLONIES
AB Genetic variability within colonies of eusocial insects is often higher than expected if kin selection alone explains sociality. Parasites and pathogens have been proposed as selective agents maintaining genetic variability in populations and promoting polyandry in social insects. Using the natural system, bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, and their trypanosome parasites, Crithidia bombi, we find that hosts vary in susceptibility or parasites in infectiousness, and that parasite transmission in social groups correlates with genetic relatedness among hosts. Therefore parasite-mediated negative frequency-dependent selection could play an important role in structuring the genetic composition of social groups by counteracting kin selection for high relatedness.

TI VIRUS SPREAD AND VECTOR DYNAMICS IN GENETICALLY DIVERSE
   PLANT-POPULATIONS
AB Little is known about the influence of genetic diversity in plant populations on the dynamics of plant viruses, particularly those transmitted by insects.  For these viruses, plant genetic diversity may affect virus incidence through impacts on the population dynamics of the vector insects or through impacts on vector feeding behavior, which determines transmission of the virus.  This study was designed to explore the influence of plant genetic diversity on virus dispersal by aphid vectors and to examine the biological mechanisms responsible for that influence.
   In a set of field experiments using the aphid-transmitted barley yellow dwarf virus, I examined the influence of genetic diversity in oat (Avena sativa L.) populations on the spread of the virus and on the population dynamics and movement behavior of aphid vectors of the virus.  Only at relatively high aphid abundance were the densities of aphid vectors influenced by plant genetic diversity.  In one year out of three, densities of the oat-bird cherry aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), were significantly lower in the genetically diverse stand than in the genetically homogeneous stands.  In no year were densities of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.), influenced by the host-plant population.  Despite these weak or absent effects on vector abundance, the incidence of the virus was consistently lower in the genetically diverse oat populations.
   Disease reduction in the diverse populations appears to depend upon changes in aphid movement behavior that affect the efficiency of virus transmission.  Mark-release experiments with S. avenae demonstrated that movement rates were significantly higher and plant tenure times were significantly lower in the genetically diverse oat populations.  Because the barley yellow dwarf virus requires several hours of aphid feeding for effective transmission, these reduced tenure times and increased travel time among plants led to a reduction of virus transmission.
   While plant genotype can clearly influence herbivorous insects dramatically, this study suggests that the effects on insects of genetic diversity per se in the host-plant population are likely to be subtle and not easily detected using standard field sampling techniques, except at high insect densities.  Yet even at low vector densities, behavioral responses to plant genetic diversity can lead to significant effects on the spread of pathogens.

TI GENETIC-VARIATION IN A FUNGAL PATHOGEN - RESPONSE TO HOST DEFENSIVE
   CHEMICALS
AB In response to infection by shoot infecting pathogens, Scots pine releases cortical resin into affected tissues.  The resin contains a mixture of monoterpene compounds (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, 3-carene, beta-myrcene, limonene and beta-phellandrene) that retard the growth of a range of pathogens.  The proportion of each monoterpene in the resin shows substantial variation among trees within a population.  Thus pathogens on different trees encounter quite different monoterpene environments.  To investigate the evolutionary response of pathogens to the chemically heterogeneous environment provided by Scots pine, isolates of the ascomycete canker pathogen Crumenulopsis sororia were collected from trees within a range of natural Scots pine populations.  Growth rates of these isolates were measured in the presence and absence of five host monoterpenes.  Substantial heritable variation for growth rate in the presence and absence of monoterpenes, and for monoterpene tolerance was recorded, suggesting the potential for the evolution of chemically specialized pathogen subpopulations on different trees within a wood.  However, genetic correlations between growth rates in different monoterpene environments and between tolerance of different monoterpenes were either positive or non-significant, and there was no evidence of "tradeoffs" in performance under different monoterpene regimes.  The results suggest that, on its own, the presence of monoterpene variability within Scots pine will not lead to disruptive selection on the C. sororia population.  The relationship between defensive chemical diversity and pest resistance is discussed in the light of these results.

TI HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS IN NATURAL-POPULATIONS OF LINUM-MARGINALE AND
   MELAMPSORA-LINI .1. PATTERNS OF RESISTANCE AND RACIAL VARIATION IN A
   LARGE HOST POPULATION
AB Populations of wild flax, Linum marginale and its associated rust fungus Melampsora lini growing at Kiandra, New South Wales, Australia, were sampled during the 1986-1987 growing season.  Thirteen different races of M. lini were detected in a sample of 96 isolates.  The distribution of isolates was uneven:  race A comprised 73% of the samples; race N, 8%; and race H, 5%; while the remaining races were represented by only one or two samples.  The dominance of race A increased over the course of the growing season, comprising 67% of the early season samples and increasing to 78% for those collected late in the season.  The overall diversity of the pathogen population decreased late in the growing season, but this trend was not statistically significant.  The average virulence of individual isolates of the pathogen population increased during the growing season.  This trend was most pronounced among the minor races, where the mean number of differential hosts infected increased from 4.58 for early season samples to 5.12 and 5.08 for mid and late season samples, respectively.  In contrast to the virulence pattern in the pathogen, the L. marginale population displayed a more even distribution of resistance.  In a sample of 67 plants, 10 resistance phenotypes were detected from their pattern of resistance/susceptibility to seven pathogen isolates.  No phenotype had a frequency that exceeded 30%.  Resistance phenotypes were randomly distributed on both a population level and on a fine scale.

TI A METHOD FOR ESTIMATING HIV TRANSMISSION RATES AMONG FEMALE SEX PARTNERS
   OF MALE INTRAVENOUS-DRUG-USERS
AB There are few data available on the dynamics of heterosexual human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission among women whose only risk factor is sexual contact with intravenous drug-using males.  Unlike models which rely on unconfirmed estimates regarding sexual partner selectivity and contact rates between infected and uninfected populations, data from a survey conducted between November 1988 and February 1989 of 1,842 women in New York City provide empirical values for these variables which the authors use in a straightforward estimation model.  The authors estimate that the number of new infections among women aged 15-44 years in New York City during 1988 was between 876 and 1,668 and that the number of women already infected through heterosexual contact with male intravenous drug users is between 5,390 and 10,230 among the 1,844,285 women in this age group.  These conclusions indicate that male-to-female transmission in New York City is of substantial magnitude and that prevention efforts among male intravenous drug users and their female sexual partners must be appropriately directed.

TI ADENOVIRUS-21 INFECTION IN AN ISOLATED ANTARCTIC STATION - TRANSMISSION
   OF THE VIRUS AND SUSCEPTIBILITY OF THE POPULATION
AB Natural dissemination of viral respiratory illness to susceptible men may occur with surprising difficulty.  This was especially evident during a 1977 outbreak of adenovirus type 21 (Ad-21) at McMurdo Station, a US research base in Antarctica.  The unique circumstances at McMurdo allowed 125 men from the US to join and intermingle with 75 men who had wintered for 6 months in complete isolation.  For an additional 5-week (September 2 to October 4, 1977) isolation period, respiratory illness etiology and transmission were monitored in the combined population.  A total of 89% of the population was susceptible (neutralizing antibody titer, < 1:3) to Ad-21 but only 15.0% were infected.  Illness spread very slowly (1.5 cases/100 persons/week) with no epidemic peak and was much less severe than Ad-21 outbreaks in other settings.  The incidence of infection (17.3%) and illness (9.6%) was low even in men who had wintered over, with values very similar to those of the newcomers (13.9% and 8.9%, respectively).  Thus, despite a harsh environment and frequent prolonged gatherings of susceptible personnel, even a respiratory virus type with known epidemic potential was surprisingly difficult to transmit.

TI REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE-ASSOCIATED RNASEH ACTIVITY MEDIATES TEMPLATE
   SWITCHING DURING REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION INVITRO
AB During the first steps of reverse transcription of the retroviral genome, sequences present at the extremities of the RNA are used to reconstitute a host cell PolII promoter. The assembly of the promoter occurs by template switching, which takes advantage of a direct repeat at the ends of the RNA molecule. These steps are catalysed by the viral reverse transcriptase, which carries an intrinsic RNaseH activity that is probably also involved therein. To study the role of the RNaseH activity in this first template-switching event, an in vitro system has been developed based on primer extensions of synthetic RNAs. When an RNA was reverse transcribed with wild-type reverse transcriptase in the presence of a second RNA the 3' part of which was repeated at the 5' end of the first one, extension products could be observed corresponding to a chimeric cDNA comprising both RNA species. This template switching could not be detected when a mutant reverse transcriptase lacking the RNaseH activity was was used. The results show that the RNaseH activity is needed to remove the 5' RNA sequences from the cDNA:RNA hybrid thereby enabling its translocation to another RNA containing an appropriate complementary target sequence.

TI NEW GENERATION VACCINES - DOES ANTIBODY PLAY A DIRECTIONAL ROLE IN
   ANTIGEN-PROCESSING
AB Analyses of recombinant proteins isolated from genomic libraries of pathogenic organisms represent the beginning of identifying immunologically-reactive epitopes. The induction of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to any pathogen begins with the uptake and processing of antigen by antigen-presenting cells and the display of specific epitopes to the immune system of the host. Little emphasis is placed on the molecular mechanisms underlying transport of foreign proteins into antigen-presenting cells and factors that influence degradation to the peptides which represent the epitopes that associate with newly synthesized class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex. These cellular processes are crucial to the design of any new generation vaccine. We describe our analysis of the 18 kDa protein antigen of Mycobacterium leprae and consider a possible role for antibody in antigen-processing. In both macrophage/dendritic cells and B lymphocytes, we suggest that antibody plays a directional role in antigen uptake, subcellular compartmentalization, and antigen degradation to yield peptides. These steps will all have an impact on the construction of new generation vaccines.

TI AN ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOLOGICAL CAPACITY OF A SACRAMENTO VALLEY
   POPULATION OF AEDES-MELANIMON TO VECTOR ARBOVIRUSES
AB Daily survivorship, duration of the gonotrophic cycle, absolute abundance and season-long relative abundance were estimated for Aedes melanimon in the Sacramento Valley of California in 1987 and 1988 using mark-release-recapture (MRR) techniques and by monitoring changes in the abundance and parity rate of the native population. One objective of these studies was to determine the extent to which A. melanimon was biologically capable of serving as a horizontal arbovirus vector. Daily survivorship was estimated to be 0.90 and 0.84 in MRR studies conducted in September 1987 and August 1988, 0.89 based on changes in the parity state and abundance of the native population in August 1988 and 0.82 using summer-long parity data in 1988. Gonotrophic cycle length (GCL) was estimated to be five days in three studies. Aedes melanimon densities were estimated to be approximately 1,000,000 and 15,000 females per hectare in September 1987 and August 1988 respectively. Parous A. melanimon females were collected on each sampling occasion from April to November 1988, suggesting that A. melanimon maintained a continuous presence in the study area throughout the summer.
   The results of these studies suggest that A. melanimon has the potential to be an efficient horizontal vector of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), based on high adult survivorship, short GCL, high abundance and a continuous presence across the summer. This supports the concept of a WEE transmission cycle in the Sacramento Valley involving Ae. melanimon as an important vector. Aedes melanimon also can be an efficient horizontal vector of California encephalitis virus (CE), though the importance of horizontal transmission to the maintenance of CE virus is unclear.

TI THE ROLES OF DENSITY, STAGE, AND PATCHINESS IN THE TRANSMISSION OF AN
   INSECT VIRUS
AB Although the importance of insect viruses in the population dynamics of their hosts is widely acknowledged, ecologists are still relatively ignorant of the factors determining the rate of transmission of insect viruses in the field.  I performed a series of field experiments in which I investigated the transmission dynamics of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata (Lepidoptera:  Lymantriidae), in northern Idaho, USA.  In these experiments, I reared healthy and infected larvae together on seedling Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and used the number of healthy larvae that became infected as a measure of transmission.  I explored the influences of density, stage structure, and spatial structure on transmission by manipulating the density and stage distribution of healthy and infected hosts, and the spatial distribution of infected hosts.  The experiments indicate that transmission is strongly affected by the densities of both healthy and infected hosts, but the effect depends on the instar of each.  Late instars are both more infectious and more likely to become infected than are early instars, so that the NPV is more likely to spread in populations of late-instar tussock moth larvae.  I also found that transmission is affected by the spatial distribution of infected hosts, and this effect also depends on the instar of healthy hosts.  That is, transmission to healthy early instars decreases with increasing patchiness of infected hosts, but transmission to healthy late instars is essentially unaffected by patchiness.  I discuss how these results can be interpreted in terms of behavioral differences among instars, and relate the results to the mathematical theory of disease and the use of viruses in biological pest control.

TI ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF ARBOVIRUSES FROM THE SULTANATE OF OMAN

Two strains of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 4 and two strains of Akabane virus, were isolated and identified. Both BTV isolates and one Akabane virus isolate came from goats while the second Akabane isolate came from Culicoides imicola. This is the first isolation of an Akabane virus from Culicoides in Arabia. Vector competence studies with the Oman viruses in laboratory reared C. variipennis showed that after oral infection both viruses replicated in Culicoides and were maintained at high titre for at least 10 days post infection.

TI PARASITE LOADS IN PARTHENOGENETIC AND SEXUAL LIZARDS
   (HETERONOTIA-BINOEI) - SUPPORT FOR THE RED QUEEN HYPOTHESIS
AB One version of the Red Queen hypothesis suggests that sexual reproduction is maintained in populations because of the need to continually create genotypes that confer resistance against rapidly evolving pathogens and parasites. Here, we report that parthenogenetic individuals of the Heteronotia binoei species complex are much more prone to infection by mites than are their sexual relatives. This accords with a central prediction of the Red Queen hypothesis. The greater susceptibility of the parthenogens is consistent across localities with different combinations of parthenogenetic genotypes and sexual chromosome races and occurs despite the unusually high genetic diversity of the parthenogenetic form. These observations support the contention that clonal reproduction increases the susceptibility of hosts to infection by parasites.

TI HUMAN T-LYMPHOTROPIC VIRUS TYPE-I (HTLV-I) SEROPREVALENCE IN JAMAICA .2.
   GEOGRAPHIC AND ECOLOGIC DETERMINANTS
AB An island-wide cohort of 13,260 Jamaicans who applied for food-handling licenses during 1985 and 1986 were tested for antibodies to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). Demographic and residence history data were linked to geographic and ecologic measures of elevation, rainfall, crop-growing areas, population density, and additional measures of urbanization and correlated with HTLV-I antibody status. By logistic regression analysis (performed separately for men and women), men and women who currently resided at low elevation (less-than-or-equal-to 1,000 ft (305 m)) were more likely to be HTLV-I infected than were those residing at high elevation. Men, but not women, who were born in citrus-growing areas were more likely to be HTLV-I infected than were men who were born in other areas. By univariate analysis, there was a significant positive trend of increasing HTLV-I seroprevalence with increasing amount of annual rainfall associated with birthplace and primary residence areas. However, these associations did not remain significant after adjusting for age and sex. These environmental associations raise the possibility of new modes of viral transmission or host response to infection, although they may simply be surrogates for socioeconomic status, breastfeeding habits, or sexual behavior, which are known determinants of HTLV-I zero prevalence.

TI SELECTION OF BENEVOLENCE IN A HOST-PARASITE SYSTEM
AB A paradigm for the evolution of cooperation between parasites and their hosts argues that the mode of parasite transmission is critical to the long-term maintenance of cooperation.  Cooperation is not expected to be maintained whenever the chief mode of transmission is horizontal:  a parasite's progeny infect hosts unrelated to their parent's host.  Cooperation is expected to be maintained if the chief mode of transmission is vertical:  a parasite's progeny infect only the parent's host or descendants of that host.  This paradigm was tested using bacteria and filamentous bacteriophage (f1).  When cells harboring different variants of these phage were cultured so that no infectious spread was allowed, ensuring that all parasite transmission was vertical, selection favored the variants that were most benevolent to the host - those that least harmed host growth rate.  By changing the culture conditions so that horizontal spread of the phage was allowed, the selective advantage of the benevolent forms was lost.  These experiments thus support the theoretical arguments that mode of transmission is a major determinant in the evolution of cooperation between a parasite and its host.

TI THE INTERACTION PHENOTYPE IN THE DROSOPHILA-WILLISTONI-SPIROPLASMA
   SYMBIOSIS
AB Both the population and coevolutionary dynamics of hereditary male-lethal endosymbionts, found in a wide range of insect species, depend on host fitness and endosymbiont transmission rates.  This paper reports on fitness effects and transmission rates in three lines of Drosophila willistoni infected with either male-lethal spiroplasmas or a spontaneous nonmale-lethal mutant.  Overall fitness measures were reduced or unaffected by the infection; however, some infected females produced more offspring in early broods.  Maternal transmission rates were high, but imperfect, and varied with a female's age, host line, and spiroplasma type.  No evidence for paternal or horizontal transmission was found.  If an altered temporal pattern of reproduction is not a factor in countering the loss of spiroplasma hosts through imperfect maternal transmission, persistence of this endoparasitism remains unexplained.  Tolerance of the infection and ability to transmit bacteria varied with both host and spiroplasma line.  Analysis of the interaction between the spontaneous nonmale-lethal mutant and its host suggests this symbiosis has undergone coevolution under laboratory culture.

TI THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF AN ALIEN INSECT - ANDRICUS-QUERCUSCALICIS
   (HYMENOPTERA, CYNIPIDAE)
AB (1) We describe the results of the first 10 years of a long-term study of the population biology of a cynipid gall wasp, Andricus quercuscalicis (Burgsdorf 1783), an alien herbivorous insect that appears to have reached the limits of its geographical distribution within England.
   (2) We document the annual fluctuations in abundance of the sexual generation on Quercus cerris (L.), the Turkey oak, and the agamic (parthenogenetic) generation on Q. robur (L.), the English oak, as measured by gall densities per shoot of the host tree.  The sexual generation has fluctuated 6-fold and the agamic generation has fluctuated 10-fold over the 10-year period.
   (3) Resource use and rates of parasitism vary substantially between the two generations.  The agamic generation on Q. robur uses 35-60% of the acorn crop in any given year, whereas the sexual generation on Q. cerris uses only 2-8% of the male flowers.  There was virtually no parasitism of the agamic generation, while the sexual generation suffers 25-35% mortality from a group of five native parasitoids.
   (4) The two generations appear to be loosely coupled.  It is impossible to predict the abundance of one generation from the numbers in the previous generation, either within or between years.  Three features of the system contribute to this uncoupling:  (i) the insect is food limited in the agamic generation; (ii) acorn production fluctuated 20-fold, independent of gall densities; (iii) there were two large variable migration mortalities between each generation.
   (5) There was extremely high tree-to-tree variation in the rate of galling on both species of oak, and these differences were consistent from year to year.  Some trees have never been galled, while others support predictably high gall densities losing over 90% of their acorns every year.  The possible causes and consequences of this heterogeneity are discussed.
   (6) The invasion of A. quercuscalicis appears to have had less impact on the native guild of oak-galling cynipids than might have been predicted.  Competitive effects appear to be negligible, as the wasp attacks tissues on the two oak species that are not utilized by other cynipids in the U.K.  The effect of adding an abundant new host on the dynamics of shared natural enemies was reduced because virtually all the parasitoids emerging from the sexual galls on Q. cerris were males, and the agamic galls were almost parasite-free.

TI SYPHILIS, NEUROSYPHILIS, PENICILLIN, AND AIDS
AB Early neurosyphilis, characterized by meningitis, cranial nerve abnormalities, and cerebrospinal accidents, was first described in patients with syphilis who received inadequate courses of arsphenamine.  Although more effective, penicillin at conventional doses does not yield treponemacidal levels in the central nervous system and probably does not eradicate the infecting organisms, suggesting that it works synergistically with the host's immune response in preventing neurosyphilis.  Neurosyphilis after penicillin therapy was almost unheard of in the United States until it began to appear in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients.  Numerous cases of syphilitic meningitis, cranial nerve abnormalities, and strokes have been reported in the past decade; about one-half of reported patients had received penicillin therapy, often within the previous 6 months.  Thus, more intensive diagnostic evaluation, perhaps including routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis, more intensive therapy, for example with at least three doses of benzathine penicillin, and far more rigorous follow-up are indicated in HIV-infected subjects with syphilis.  Since the efficacy of conventional therapy is now uncertain, novel approaches to treatment deserve systematic evaluation.

TI ASSESSING RISK-FACTORS FOR TRANSMISSION OF INFECTION
AB Commonly used measures of effect, such as risk ratios and odds ratios, may be quite biased when used to assess the effect of factors that alter transmission risks given exposure to infected individuals. This is demonstrated in a simulation model involving a higher-risk behavior and a lower-risk behavior affecting the sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. The bias arises because population contact patterns between higher-risk and lower-risk persons change their relative probabilities of exposure to an infected individual as an epidemic progresses. The assessment of contact patterns is thus central to risk assessment for contagious diseases. A new formulation of selective mixing presented here, together with a structured mixing specification of the social settings of contact, provides a theoretic framework for the investigation of contact pattern determinants.

TI SPONTANEOUS INVITRO SECRETION OF ANTIBODY TO CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) BY
   HUMAN PERIPHERAL-BLOOD MONONUCLEAR-CELLS - A NEW APPROACH TO STUDYING
   THE CMV-IMMUNE SYSTEM INTERACTION
AB The in vitro secretion of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific antibodies by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was analyzed in patients with acute CMV infection and CMV-seropositive patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.  This active and spontaneous in vitro secretion was not affected by the depletion of T cells or adherent cells.  The number of anti-CMV antibody-secreting cells was estimated to be 28-176/10(6) PBMC; 30%-65% of the total in vitro antibody production was CMV-specific.  This secretion seemed to be independent of in vitro polyclonal B cell activation, in vitro antigen-specific lymphocyte stimulation, or in vivo Epstein-Barr virus-induced B cell transformation.  In vitro anti-CMV antibody production may therefore result from an in vivo stimulation of the immune system by CMV antigens and might indicate CMV replication in the host.

TI PHYSICAL PROTECTION AGAINST AIRBORNE PATHOGENS AND POLLUTANTS BY A NOVEL
   ANIMAL ISOLATOR IN A LEVEL-3 CONTAINMENT LABORATORY
AB A containment laboratory unit for research with aerosols of group 2 pathogenic microorganisms is described.  The design criteria are based on current UK guidelines, which imply containment at group 3 level during aerosol production, storage, exposure of animals and sampling.  Within the aerosol laboratory, primary containment is provided by a Henderson apparatus operating at a negative pressure to the external environment.  Flexible film isolators under negative pressure are used for all hazardous microbiological work, e.g. tissue homogenization, and for housing infected laboratory rodents.  A novel feature of the animal isolator is the separate ventilation of each cage, which minimizes the risk of cross-infection by aerosol transmission and ensures a similar environment within each cage.  The results of an intentional release of a cloud of non-pathogenic microorganisms are presented to show the effectiveness of the containment barriers.  Recommendations are given for the safe operation of a containment unit based upon practical experience.

TI NONADAPTIVE EVOLUTION OF DISEASE RESISTANCE IN AN ANNUAL LEGUME
AB Local populations of the plant Amphicarpaea bracteata often contain genetically divergent lineages that differ strongly in disease resistance toward the specialist pathogen Synchytrium decipiens. In one population, lineages with disease resistance were observed to significantly decrease in frequency over a two-year period, despite the continued presence of pathogens. Extensive self-pollination in A. bracteata restricts the opportunity for recombination of alleles affecting separate traits, resulting in strong correlations between disease resistance and other ecologically important characters, including plant morphology, phenology, and patterns of reproductive allocation. Natural selection on these correlated characters may thus cause nonadaptive changes in disease resistance. These results imply that A. bracteata's mating system is a basic constraint interfering with its adaptation to pathogen attack.

TI A MODEL FOR THE BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL OF ORYCTES-RHINOCEROS (COLEOPTERA,
   SCARABAEIDAE) BY MEANS OF PATHOGENS
AB (1) We develop a mathematical population model for Oryctes rhinoceros, where it is limited both by density-dependent larval mortality and a baculovirus.
   (2) The model divides the phenology of the female beetle into three distinct life-stages:  juveniles (egg through young adult), feeders (young to middle-aged adults which are either mating or initiating attacks on palms), and breeders (older adults which lay their eggs at breeding sites).
   (3) The rates of six different transmission pathways of the baculovirus are estimated using a least squares minimization criterion based on field prevalences of disease.  This technique reveals that transmission from infected to susceptible feeding adults is the dominant route.  This is in agreement with the literature on the subject (Zelazny 1976).
   (4) The numerical simulation of the system, although differing from field observations in the first 6 months of the simulation, is in accord with longer-term field observations on the population densities, prevalence of disease, and depression of the pre-baculovirus release equilibrium of Oryctes.  The reason for the short-term differences is thought to be the omission from the model of spatial aspects of the spread of the disease.
   (5) Inundation by the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae var. majus is modelled as a long-residual, density-independent, 'biopesticide' which kills both juveniles and breeding adults.
   (6) Numerical simulations show that increasing fungus inundation rates result in substantial decreases in the juvenile beetles.  However, the fungus has no perceptible effect on the economically important populations of healthy (i.e. uninfected) feeding adults, and at high rates of application leads to an amplification in population cycles (i.e. instability) and the eventual elimination of the baculovirus from the system.

TI SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED DISEASES IN MOTHERS OF NEONATES WITH CONGENITAL
   CYTOMEGALOVIRUS-INFECTION
AB To identify maternal risk factors for intrauterine transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV), a case-control study of 175 mothers of neonates with congenital CMV infection was undertaken.  Cases and 358 randomly selected controls delivered neonates between 1980 and 1988; in this interval neonates were routinely tested for viruria.  Eighty-four percent of the study population was black and > 87% received prenatal care.  Women with gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, or bacterial vaginosis had an increased risk of intrauterine transmission of CMV, as did those who were primigravid (odds ratios, 1.8-2.5).  Women who were young, unmarried, and of lower income were almost four times more likely to deliver a CMV-infected newborn than were those who did not have all three of these factors.  These results in a predominantly black, low-income population indicate a greater risk for congenital CMV infection in offspring of young, single, primigravid mothers.  The association with gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections suggests that sexual activity is an important source of maternal CMV infections that result in congenital infection in this population.

TI HETEROGENEITIES IN TRANSMISSION RATES AND THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF
   SCHISTOSOME INFECTION
AB Previous theoretical studies have suggested that heterogeneities in transmission rates can have significant effects on the epidemiology of parasite infections. However, the magnitude of these effects in practice remains uncertain because of the difficulty of quantifying such heterogeneities under natural conditions. In this paper we consider the effects of heterogeneous rates of contact with infective water bodies on the basic reproductive rate, R0, of human schistosomes. In particular, we examine the theoretical effects of differences in the distribution of contacts among individuals and among sites. We find that an individual's contribution to R0 depends not only on the net contact rate but also on how these contacts are distributed among sites - the contact pattern. Our analysis of field data suggests a substantial impact of heterogeneous contact rates on R0 in practice. Significant reductions in R0 may be possible if schistosomiasis control efforts are targeted at certain sites and, especially, certain individuals.

TI MATURATION OF THE HUMORAL IMMUNE-RESPONSE AS AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM
AB Efficient immune response often depends on the production of high affinity antibodies. We show analytically that the optimal strategy for a fast production of high affinity antibodies is to utilize a step-function mutation rate, i.e. a minimal mutation rate in early stages of the immune response, followed by a discontinuous switch to the maximal possible rate when the proliferating population of B-cells exceeds a threshold value. Our results are in accordance with the biological observations concerning the time of onset of the hypermutation process, and with the mutation rate during the later stages of the primary immune response. Indeed the hypermutation process plays a crucial role in responding to a prevailing pathogen at each round of immune response, and not only for coping with future infections. Moreover, as the effect of hypermutations is shown to be crucially dependent on the number of proliferating B-cells, its onset is not expected to depend on an external signal, but rather to be related to the clone's age. This suggests that the onset is host species specific, rather than pathogen specific. Another implication of the present results is that activation of hypermutations before the B-cell population has reached the critical size may impede the efficiency of the response.

TI A NEW FOCUS OF SCHISTOSOMA-HAEMATOBIUM SCHISTOSOMA-INTERCALATUM HYBRID
   IN CAMEROON
AB Terminal-spined schistosome eggs were found in both stool and urine specimens of a high proportion of infected individuals in Kinding Njabi, a village located in a savannah/forest ecotone of Center Province, Cameroon. Infections with terminal-spined schistosomes are not common in that region and first appeared in Kinding Njabi in the mid-1980s. The village population, determined by house-to-house census in 1986, was 345. Of 302 stool samples examined by a thick smear technique, 58 (19%) were positive, and of 320 urine samples examined by sedimentation, 40 (12%) were positive. Twenty-six (37%) of a total of 71 infected persons passed eggs in both stool and urine. Egg size distribution and morphology were similar to previous reports for Schistosoma haematobium/S. intercalatum hybrids. Bulinus forskalii was the only snail found during extensive surveys in and around Kinding Njabi; infected snails were recovered from several temporary habitats. This focus is of particular interest because it represents the first report of transmission of hybrid schistosomes outside of the hybrid zone. Interviews with villagers and local health officials suggest that schistosomiasis was introduced by immigrants from Loum, a town approximately 100 km southwest of Kinding Njabi, where S. haematobium, S. intercalatum, and their hybrid are known to exist. Results from snail host specificity studies using the Kinding Njabi parasite showed that stool-derived miracidia were compatible only with B. forskalii, the exclusive host for S. intercalatum in Cameroon. Urine-derived miracidia were compatible only with B. truncatus, a S. haematobium host in Cameroon. The absence of any ambiguity toward snail intermediate hosts is unexpected, and indicates that small, isolated populations of hybrids may show traits uncharacteristic of parasites in a hybrid zone.

TI SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED DISEASES IN A POPULATION OF INTRAVENOUS-DRUG-USERS
   - ASSOCIATION WITH SEROPOSITIVITY TO THE HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS
   (HIV)
AB The association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity and a history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), evidence of STDs on physical examination, and sexual and drug use practices was studied in a population of 2921 intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in Baltimore during 1988 and 1989. Overall, 24.1% were HIV-seropositive at baseline, and 60% reported a history of an STD. A significant association was found between HIV seropositivity and a history of syphilis (P = .04); both were more frequent among homosexual/bisexual men than among heterosexual IVDUs. In multivariate analysis, a history of syphilis was independently associated with HIV seroprevalence in homosexual/bisexual male IVDUs, of whom 90% reported a history of sexual intercourse with women. Cocaine injection was independently associated with HIV seropositivity but not a history of syphilis on multivariate analysis. STDs, indicative of unsafe sex practices, are common in this population; efforts are needed to prevent sexual transmission of HIV infection among IVDUs and their sex partners.

TI INVIVO AND INVITRO EXPRESSION OF HAEMOPHILUS-INFLUENZAE TYPE-B
   LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE EPITOPES
AB An indirect immunofluorescence system involving monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against surface epitopes of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) lipooligosaccharide (LOS) was used to examine individual Hib cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from infants with Hib meningitis. In four of five CSF samples studied, 100% of the bacteria bound at least one LOS-directed MAb. When the bacteria from these CSF samples were grown in broth, most of these cells lost some or all of their ability to bind the MAb(s) that were bound by the same organisms present in human CSF. When in vitro-grown cells were used for intracisternal injection of rabbits, the populations of Hib cells observed in rabbit CSF after the development of meningitis generally resembled those of the respective broth-grown inocula in terms of their LOS antigenic characteristics. Hib cell populations recovered in infant rat CSF after intranasal challenge again had LOS antigenic characteristics similar to those of the in vitro-grown challenge inocula. These results indicate that a population of Hib cells growing in the infected human host may be quite different, with regard to its LOS antigenic characteristics, from the same Hib strain growing in vitro or in vivo in animal models.

TI CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT DURING INFECTION BY
   PHLEBOVIRUS-TOSCANA OF RESIDENTS IN NATURAL FOCI IN CENTRAL ITALY
   (1977-1988)
AB Central nervous system (CNS) involvement was detected during infection caused by the sand fly-transmitted Phlebovirus Toscana. One hundred fifty-five cases of Toscana virus-associated meningitis or meningoencephalitis were identified in a survey that lasted ten years, conducted in two regions of central Italy. Diagnosis was performed by different serologic tests. A combination of hemagglutination-inhibition and plaque-reduction neutralization or indirect immunofluorescence for IgM, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IgM were considered the most suitable tests for the diagnosis of Toscana virus infection. A few strains of Toscana virus were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of seropositive patients. Toscana virus-associated CNS disease occurred during the summer, reaching a peak value in August, when the maximum activity of the sand fly vector occurs and virus isolates are obtained in their natural foci.
   The results suggest that Toscana virus should be considered as a possible cause of CNS disease in Mediterranean countries where sand flies of the genus Phlebotomus are known to be present.

   STUDIES OF FECAL ENTEROBACTER-CLOACAE STRAINS FROM INFANTS IN SWEDISH
   NEONATAL WARDS
AB The PhenePlate (PhP) biochemical fingerprinting system is an automated method for typing of bacteria, based on the evaluation of the kinetics of biochemical reactions, performed in microtitre plates. In the present study the PhP-Klebsiella/Enterobacter (KE) system was evaluated for typing of Enterobacter cloacae and employed to study the epidemiology of faecal E. cloacae strains isolated from infants in 22 Swedish neonatal wards. The PhP-KE system showed a high reproducibility and discrimination for E. cloacae isolates. Among 64 epidemiologically unrelated E. cloacae strains, 49 distinct phenotypes were found, and the diversity index was 0.985. E. cloacae was found as a part of the dominating Gram-negative aerobic bacterial flora in 83 out of 953 infants studied. The incidences of E. cloacae colonization varied between 0 and 35% in different wards. but in contrast to previous data for Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, there was little evidence of spread of particular strains in the wards. We also discuss two different measures of nosocomial transmission of bacterial strains: transmissible strains and epidemic index.

TI A SEROSURVEY FOR HTLV-I AMONG HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS AND NORMAL ADULTS IN
   EGYPT
AB The prevalence of antibodies to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) was determined in high-risk groups and normal adults in Egypt. Among 647 individuals tested, 6 (0.9%) were confirmed positive by western blot analysis. These included 2 (0.7%) of 279 drug addicts, 1 (3.3%) of 30 patients with sexually transmitted diseases, and 3 (2.2%) of 133 healthy individuals. Antibody was not detected in 47 blood recipients or 158 prostitutes. There was no correlation between sex or geographical location and HTLV-1 infection. Fifty-three of the 647 sera (8%) were initially reactive by ELISA, but only 12 sera were repeatedly reactive. Since only 4 of these repeatedly reactive sera were confirmed by the western blot, the frequency of false positives using the DuPont screening ELISA was 1.2% (8/643). Two additional sera. confirmed positive by western blot, had been reactive, but not repeatedly, by ELISA. In comparison to the prevalence of HTLV-I antibody among risk groups in many parts of the world, the prevalence in Egypt was low.

TI THE EFFECTS OF HOST DENSITY AND PARASITE CROWDING ON MOVEMENT AND PATCH
   FORMATION OF THE ECTOPARASITIC SNAIL, BOONEA-IMPRESSA - FIELD AND
   MODELING RESULTS
AB (1) Field experiments were conducted to investigate movement and patch formation of the ectoparasitic snail, Boonea (= Odostomia) impressa (Say) on its oyster host, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). (2) Snails were contagiously distributed, typically positively spatially autocorrelated, and moved frequently among existing snail aggregates, choosing hosts independently of the hosts' physical characteristics. Despite movement of 20-30% of the snail population daily, snail patches persisted over periods of 2 weeks or more. (3) The distance between hosts was more important in determining the spatial distribution of snails in the host population than parasite crowding. When host density was high, movement of snails between snail patches reduced the variance in patch size as predicted by some models of ecological fitness, such as risk spreading. (4) Increased snail density did not affect the frequency of movement indicating hat crowding did not affect the size of snail patches over densities normally encountered in the field. A directionally biased random walk model for the parasite reproduced most physical characteristics of snail distribution including the decline in variance and, the persistence of snail patches. (5) By preferring to move frequently among existing aggregates, Boonea impressa choose to minimize the variance in the size of snail patches rather than minimizing movement and, hence, energy expenditure.

   POLYGYRUS (NEMATODA) IN ENCLOSED WOOD MOUSE-POPULATIONS
AB (1) This study examined the interaction between Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Nematoda) and wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, populations housed in large open-air enclosures at Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, between April 1988 and 1990. (2) Wood mouse reproduction was strongly seasonal and mimicked that of wild populations. Overall, reproduction was not influenced by the presence of the parasite. (3) In contrast, wood mouse survival (from 1 month of age onwards) was compromised in infected mice compared with controls. Survival also varied with month of mouse birth, such that survival was poorest for individuals born in the middle of the breeding season (April-August) and greatest for those born at the end of this period (August-October). (4) Parasite prevalence was 98% and average intensity of infection around 80 worms per mouse. Male mice harboured slightly more parasites than females, although differences were not statistically significant. (5) Parasite burden of individual mice varied greatly, ranging from 0 to 371 worms per mouse, and parasites were highly aggregated or overdispersed within the host population. Overdispersion was similar in both sexes and increased with mouse age. (6) There was a negative correlation between worm burden and mouse age in female, but not in male, wood mice. Parasite fecundity (assessed through parasite gg counts) was not associated with mouse worm burden. (7) Infection of offspring born to 'infected' and 'control' enclosures during May 1990 demonstrated no significant differences in susceptibility to repeated H. polygyrus infection under experimental conditions in the laboratory.

TI DECLINING SEROPREVALENCE AND TRANSMISSION OF HTLV-I IN JAPANESE FAMILIES
   WHO IMMIGRATED TO HAWAII
AB This study examined the seroprevalence and transmission of human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) in Japanese families who originated in Okinawa, an area in which HTLV-I is endemic, and who were currently residing in Hawaii, a nonendemic area.  Among a cohort of Japanese men whose sera were collected in Hawaii in 1967-1975, those of Okinawan ancestry had an HTLV-I seroprevalence of 11.4%.  This study, conducted in 1987-1988, sampled 142 index subjects from this male cohort and tested them along with their wives, children, and spouses of the children for HTLV-I antibodies.  Seropositivity in their wives was 11.4% and 41.2% among the seronegative and seropositive index subjects, respectively; seropositivity also increased from 29.4% to 35.3% to 58.8% with the husbands' increasing antibody levels by tertiles.  Elevated antibody levels may be a marker for infectivity, which is associated with more efficient sexual transmission of HTLV-I.  The age-adjusted odds ratio for the association of seropositivity between husband and wife, however, was four times lower than that reported among native Okinawans.  In addition, a substantially low seroprevalence (1.3%) was found among their offspring.  The decline in HTLV-I transmission in this migrant population may be due to low infectivity in the parent generation who live in a nonendemic environment, increasing numbers of offspring marrying outside of the Okinawan community, and improved living circumstances.

TI EMERGENCE AND POSSIBLE TRANSMISSION OF AMANTADINE-RESISTANT VIRUSES
   DURING NURSING-HOME OUTBREAKS OF INFLUENZA A (H3N2)
AB Outbreaks of influenza A (H3N2, A/Shanghai/11/87-like) occurred in two partially (60% and 79%) vaccinated nursing home populations in January 1988.  A retrospective cohort study using chart review was designed to assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccination and amantadine prophylaxis (100 mg per day) in controlling the outbreaks and to determine the amantadine susceptibility of influenza viruses isolated from case-patients.  The point estimate of vaccine efficacy in preventing influenza-like illness was -33% (95% confidence interval -115% to 18%).  However, 9% of vaccinated case-patients died within 14 days after onset of influenza-like illness compared with 26% of unvaccinated case-patients (relative risk = 0.4, 95% confidence interval 0.1-1.0).  There was no significant difference in illness severity among case-patients who became ill before amantadine prophylaxis was started (n = 84) compared with those who became ill while taking amantadine (n = 34).  Four virus isolates obtained before amantadine prophylaxis was started demonstrated 52-68% inhibition by 1-mu-g/ml of amantadine; by comparison, six isolates (resistant viruses) obtained from residents who became ill while taking amantadine demonstrated 1-18% inhibition.  The resistant viruses had four different RNA sequences in the gene coding for the M2 protein transmembrane region.  Three resistant viruses with identical RNA sequences were isolated from residents living in contiguous rooms who had onset of signs and symptoms during a 6-day interval.  Further studies are needed to determine how frequently and under what circumstances resistant viruses occur when antiviral agents are used to control institutional influenza A outbreaks.  Strategies for antiviral agent administration that limit the emergence and transmission of resistant virus strains may be needed.

TI HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS IN NATURAL-POPULATIONS OF LINUM-MARGINALE AND
   MELAMPSORA-LINI .2. LOCAL AND REGIONAL VARIATION IN PATTERNS OF
   RESISTANCE AND RACIAL STRUCTURE
AB Spatial variation in the resistance structure of Linum marginale (wild flax) populations to the rust fungus Melampsora lini, and in the racial structure of this pathogen, was investigated by sampling 10 populations distributed throughout the Kosciusko National Park, New South Wales, Australia.  Considerable differences were found among populations in the structure of both host and pathogen.  Host populations were divided into three broad categories:  (1) populations susceptible to all testing races; (2) populations containing a strictly limited number of resistant phenotypes; and (3) populations with a considerable diversity of resistant phenotypes.  The pathogen populations also showed a range of diversity.  The major differences between these populations were determined by the occurrence and frequency of four common races of pathogen (races A, E, K, and N).  These differences were apparent both at a regional spatial scale (over the 100 km separation of the most distant populations) and at a local scale where major differences were detected between two populations only 300 m apart.  The distribution of the four common races of M. lini was consistent with the hypothesis that a fitness cost was associated with unnecessary virulence.  In general, however, differences in the structure of pathogen populations from genetically very similar host populations implied that, in addition to host resistance genes, other evolutionary forces are also important in determining the genetic structure of individual pathogen populations.

   (FASCIOLOIDES-MAGNA) AND ITS DEFINITIVE HOST
AB The population genetic structure of the American liver fluke, Fascioloides magma, and its definitive host the white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, was examined in South Carolina. Flukes were significantly more common in deer from river-swamp habitat than upland areas and prevalence increased with host age. The distribution of flukes among deer occurred as a negative binomial with the mean dispersion parameter, k, equal to 0.17 and the range from 0.10 to 1.11 within local areas. Significant spatial genetic differentiation was observed for flukes and deer. Patterns of genetic distance in flukes were not concordant with those of the definitive host nor were they related to geographic distance between sample locations. Spatial genetic differentiation among flukes reflected the tendency for individual hosts to harbor multiple individuals from a limited number of parasite clones. The large population size of the parasite and movements of the definitive host tend to counteract factors that lead to spatial differentiation.

TI ESTIMATING THE 1978-1990 AND FUTURE SPREAD OF
   HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1 IN SUBGROUPS OF HOMOSEXUAL MEN
AB The authors studied the historical spread of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in homosexual/bisexual men and projected its future spread in these men using data from an AIDS-free cohort recruited during late 1984 in Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Dates of preentry seroconversion in HIV-1 seroprevalent men were estimated using study entry values of hematologic variables influenced by HIV-1 infection. The authors used survival methods incorporating truncation to determine numbers/dates of seroconversion for men with a pre-1984 AIDS diagnosis who were selectively excluded by design from the 1984 AIDS-free cohort. Overall, the annual seroconversion hazard rose progressively from 0.4% in 1978 to 13.8% in 1983, dropped to 4.6% in 1985, and remained relatively stable at 1.1-2.2% from 1986 to 1990. By January 1990, almost 46% of men who were seronegative in 1978 had seroconverted. The authors estimated historical rates of spread by city, age, education, and ethnicity to examine the effects of these factors in the early and continuing stages of the HIV-1 epidemic. There were striking differences among cities with respect to pre-1985 seroconversion rates but not with respect to post-1985 seroconversion rates. Age, education, and ethnicity were all associated with 1978-1990 seroconversion rates. Future seroconversion among homosexual men was predicted assuming that the "stabilized" 1986-1990 hazards (stratified by age) observed here will be representative of future rates. Truncated Kaplan-Meier methods gave the probability of a seronegative 20-year-old man's remaining seronegative in subsequent years. Such a man has a 20.2% chance of seroconverting before reaching the age of 25 years (a 4.4% yearly hazard). The annual hazard drops to 2.5% between 25 and 30 years, to about 1.5% between 30 and 45 years, and to 1.0% between 45 and 55 years. The overall probability of seroconversion prior to age 55 years is about 50%, with seroconversion still continuing at and after age 55. Given that this cohort consists of volunteers receiving extensive anti-HIV-1 transmission education, the future seroconversion rates of the general homosexual population may be even higher than those observed here.

AB In order to define the risk factors for infection with hepatitis C virus, the authors determined the prevalence and incidence of antibodies to hepatitis C in three cohorts in Baltimore, Maryland, enrolled in prospective studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. Among 500 multitransfused patients who underwent cardiac surgery in 1985 and 1986, 12 (2.4%) were hepatitis C seropositive before surgery while 19 (3.9%) developed antibodies in the 8-12 months after surgery. The seroprevalence of hepatitis C virus among 225 intravenous drug users followed since 1988 was 85%, which did not vary by HIV-1 status. Longer duration of intravenous drug use was significantly associated with hepatitis C seropositivity. Among 926 homosexual/bisexual men followed since 1984, 15 (1.6%) were hepatitis C seropositive; only intravenous drug use and a history of hepatitis A were marginally associated with hepatitis C in this population. No association was found between hepatitis C virus and HIV-1 or sexual behavior variables in this population. These data suggest that hepatitis C is readily transmitted by blood exposure, but is transmitted inefficiently by sexual means.

TI GONOCOCCAL-INFECTION AND HUMAN-FERTILITY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
AB An analysis is presented of the influence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae on human population growth in regions of sub-Saharan Africa where gonococcal infections are prevalent in sexually active adults. Combining epidemiological and demographic data within the framework of a mathematical model, we show that gonorrhoea has a major impact on fertility and, concomitantly, on net population growth in areas with a high prevalence of untreated infections. Specifically, a 20% prevalence in sexually active adults is predicted to induce a 50% reduction in net population growth. Model predictions are in good agreement with observed data from Uganda, and the sensitivity of the prediction to various complications, such as heterogeneity in sexual behaviour, is assessed. The analysis suggests that the predicted increase in fertility arising from expanded sexually transmitted disease (STD) control programmes in Africa to help combat the spread of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and Hiv-2) will help to offset the predicted demographic impact of AIDS in the worst afflicted areas. In other areas the rise in fertility associated with effective STD control will need to be countered by the linkage Of STD control programmes with family planning initiatives.

TI CHARACTERIZATION OF A LEISHMANIA ISOLATE FROM THE RODENT HOST
   NEOTOMA-MICROPUS COLLECTED IN TEXAS AND COMPARISON WITH HUMAN ISOLATES
AB We report the biological and biochemical parameters of Leishmania parasites (MNEO/US/90/WR972) isolated from a rodent host, Neotoma micropus, collected in Texas. Footpad inoculations of WR972 promastigotes into BALB/c mice and Syrian hamsters resulted in ulcerating lesions six and eight weeks post-inoculation, respectively. Using monoclonal antibody-stained touch preparations, amastigotes were found in the liver of both laboratory hosts. Infection of J774 macrophages with WR972 promastigotes supported the growth of amastigotes for 12 days at 35-degrees-C. The WR972 parasite was identified by enzyme electrophoresis as L. mexicana. Isozyme comparison of WR972 with 42 L. mexicana isolates (from humans and rodents) from four different endemic areas, including Texas, suggest that these parasite populations are identical for approximately 97% of their genetic loci. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of WR972 resolved 18 chromosomes with a size range of 300- > 2,000 kb. The karyotype strongly resembles that of two other Texas L. mexicana isolates from humans. Taken together, the PFGE, hybridization, and isoenzyme data suggest that the wood rat isolate (WR972) is identical to parasites from human cutaneous lesions isolated in Texas and Central America. In addition, the biological characteristics of WR972, its infectivity of BALB/c mice and the Syrian hamster, and the potential of the isolate to infect, transform, and divide in J774 macrophages indicate that WR972 will be pathogenic in humans if transmission occurs. Health care providers should consider this possibility when studying the epidemiology and control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Texas.

TI DOES SPATIAL SCALE AFFECT THE INCIDENCE OF DENSITY DEPENDENCE - A
   FIELD-TEST WITH INSECT PARASITOIDS
AB We tested the hypothesis that spatial scale of investigation has an effect on the probability of detecting density dependence in the field. Specifically, we examined parasitism rates by two different parasites of one host (the salt-marsh planthopper Prokelisia) with different dispersal capabilities. One parasite, the wasp Anagrus, attacked host eggs and flew widely over the marsh, traveling on the order of kilometres. The other, the strepsipteran Elenchus, parasitized host nymphs and adults. Females of this parasite cannot fly, and dispersal is by triungulinid nymphs, which walk on host plants and can only disperse on the order of metres from their spent maternal corpse. We found no dispersing planthoppers to be carrying Elenchus. We expected no density dependence by Elenchus on a large scale, that is, over an area of 1-2 km2 but possibly some evidence of density dependence on a small scale, that is, within a few metres. By similar logic, we expected Anagrus perhaps to show density dependence at both scales because it disperses so well.
   Parasitism rate by both insect species varied widely both in space, even between adjacent sites, and through time. We found little evidence of density dependence for either type of parasite at any spatial or temporal scale. Failure to detect density dependence may be due less to the effect of looking at the wrong spatial scale than to the idiosyncratic behavior of individual parasite species.

AB Commercially available kits for detection of hepatits B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were evaluated in American Samoa during a public health programme to eliminate the transmission of hepatitis B.  The first 19184 serum specimens obtained, representing 68% of the total cooperating population, were initially tested for anti-HBs, and those without detectable antibody were tested for HBsAg.  All the antigen-positive serum samples, and a selection of the antigen and antibody-negative specimens were tested by radioimmunoassay (RIA) for detection of both markers.  Compared with the standard tests, the EIA kits for anti-HBs and HBsAg performed well; sensitivity and specificity were 90.3 and 96.0%, respectively, for antibody, and 97.8 and 97.9% respectively for antigen.  Substantial disagreement between the EIA and RIA tests for HBsAg was found only for specimens considered weakly reactive by EIA.  Few differences were found between three EIA method options contributed about equally to improved test specificity for these 'borderline' specimens.  Based on their demonstrated equivalence to the standard RIA tests, we conclude that the EIA kits for anti-HBs and HBsAg detection are suitable for use in hepatitis B control programmes in open populations.

TI REGULATION AND STABILITY OF A FREE-LIVING HOST-PARASITE SYSTEM -
   TRICHOSTRONGYLUS-TENUIS IN RED GROUSE .1. MONITORING AND PARASITE
   REDUCTION EXPERIMENTS
AB 1. Intensive population studies were conducted for 10 years on red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) and the parasitic nematode, Trichostrongylus tenuis, in northern England. Winter loss was the key factor determining changes in grouse numbers, although breeding losses were also important.
   2. T. tenuis had an aggregated distribution within the adult grouse population, even though the degree of aggregation was relatively low compared with other parasite systems. Recruitment of parasites into the adult worm population was dependent on grouse density.
   3. Both winter loss and breeding losses were correlated with the intensity of parasite infection.
   4. Experimental reduction in parasite burdens consistently increased breeding production and winter survival of grouse thus demonstrating that parasites cause increased winter and breeding losses.
   5. The red grouse-T. tenuis system exhibits three conditions that will generate population cycles: (i) parasite-induced reduction in grouse breeding production, (ii) a low degree of parasite aggregation within the grouse population, and (iii) time delays in parasite recruitment.

TI REGULATION AND STABILITY OF A FREE-LIVING HOST-PARASITE SYSTEM -
   TRICHOSTRONGYLUS-TENUIS IN RED GROUSE .2. POPULATION-MODELS
AB 1. The population dynamics of red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus and the parasitic nematode, Trichostrongylus tenuis were explored to determine whether interactions between the parasite and host were sufficient to generate cycles in grouse abundance. Two alternative models were used that explicitly consider the dynamics of either the free-living, or arrested larval stages of the parasite.
   2. Providing that the life expectancy of the free-living larvae is more than 2-4 weeks, the parasite can readily establish in grouse populations. Larval arrestment tends to reduce the intrinsic growth rate of the parasite and thus increases the size of the host population required for the parasite to establish.
   3. Grouse numbers will tend to cycle when the parasites exhibit low degrees of aggregation and parasite-induced reductions in host fecundity are greater than parasite-induced increases in host mortality. The population cycles produced in the model have the slow increase followed by a rapid decline characteristic of the grouse population studied at Gunnerside.
   4. The period of the cycles is determined by the intrinsic growth rate of the grouse population and either larval life expectancy (Model I). or the duration of larval arrestment (Model II). Cycle periods decrease as host population growth rate increases, and lengthen with increases in either free-living larval life expectancy, or the duration of larval arrestment. If the duration of larval arrestment is sufficiently long (>6 months), the cycles die out and the dynamics of the grouse-nematode system are very stable.
   5. Estimates of all of the model's parameters may be made from long-term records of grouse populations. Numerical analysis of the model's behaviour suggest that a model with limited arrested larval stages more closely corresponds to the grouse populations in the North of England. The 4-5 year cycles exhibited by these populations will be more sporadic, or absent on estates where the parasite is unable to establish.
   6. The analysis shows that the empirical data collected on T. tenuis are consistent with it being the cause of the cycles observed in grouse populations in the North of England.

TI MODELING GYPSY-MOTH VIRUS LEAF CHEMISTRY INTERACTIONS - IMPLICATIONS OF
   PLANT-QUALITY FOR PEST AND PATHOGEN DYNAMICS
AB 1. The decline phase in the population dynamics of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) is associated both with nuclear polyhedrosis virus epizootics and greater phenolics levels in preferred hosts such as red oak. Recent studies have shown that hydrolysable tannins in red oak reduce both gypsy moth (GM) fecundity and virus susceptibility.
   2. We modified the Anderson & May (1981) analytical model of invertebrate-pathogen dynamics to explore this complex interaction over a range of tannin levels, gypsy moth mortality from non-virus causes, and virus life span held constant for 100 gypsy moth generations.
   3. The most realistic gypsy moth dynamics required moderate to high levels of tannin (30-45%), low non-virus mortality (3-0 per GM per year), and long-lived virus (1 year). For simulations with low non-virus mortality and long-lived virus, the ratio of highest to lowest population density increased from 10-fold at 10% tannin to over 1000-fold at 40% tannin, then stabilized with little or no fluctuation at 50% tannin.
   4. The shift to stability at 50% tannin results from the lower sensitivity of fecundity than virus to hydrolysable tannins and a consequent decrease in the difference between virus pathogenicity and the gypsy moth's intrinsic rate of increase at high tannin levels.
   5. The dynamics generated agree well with predictions of the original Anderson & May (1981) model that stable limit cycles are promoted by: (a) longer-lived virus and (b) high pathogenicity relative to the intrinsic rate of increase. Overall, our simulations suggest that the net effect of moderate constant tannin levels over multiple generations will be destabilizing compared with low and high tannin levels.

TI DO PARASITES MAKE PREY VULNERABLE TO PREDATION - RED GROUSE AND
   PARASITES
AB 1. An extensive post-mortem survey of grouse revealed that birds killed by predators in spring and summer had significantly greater burdens of the caecal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis than grouse shot during the autumn. Furthermore, grouse that appeared to have died through the effects of parasites carried greater worm burdens than grouse killed by predators.
   2. The proportion of grouse with high levels of parasite infection increased with the intensity of predator control as measured indirectly through keeper density. These two empirical observations suggest that predators selectively prey on heavily infected grouse.
   3. The interactions between parasites and predators were examined experimentally by reducing the worm burdens of female grouse with an oral anthelmintic. Nests of treated and untreated females were subsequently located either by research workers flushing the incubating female or by dogs trained to locate birds by scent. The dogs found significantly fewer of the treated than control birds, suggesting that female grouse with large parasite burdens emit more scent and are more vulnerable to mammalian predation.
   4. A modified mathematical model of the grouse-nematode system is described which incorporates the effects of both random and selective predation of heavily parasitized grouse. An analysis of the model illustrates the importance of interactions between grouse, parasites and predators in determining the relative densities of each. In particular, when predators selectively remove heavily parasitized individuals, then low levels of predation can lead to increases in the size of the host (or prey) population.

TI POPULATION BIOLOGY OF HELIGMOSOMOIDES-POLYGYRUS (NEMATODA) IN THE WOOD
   MOUSE
AB 1. This paper examines the interaction between the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus L., and the intestinal nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus Dujardin, using data collected at Tollymore Park Forest, Co. Down, Northern Ireland, between November 1978 and July 1981.
   2. A total of 1395 mice were collected, comprising 809 (58%) male and 582 (42%) female wood mice (four individuals were not sexed); 86% of mice were infected by H. polygyrus. Mean worm burden was around 12 worms per mouse. Worm burdens did not differ with sex. Parasites were highly overdispersed within the host population.
   3. A reference curve (based upon a sample of 227 captive bred wood mice) relating dried eye lens weight to known wood mouse age was used to estimate the age of wild mice.
   4. Worm burdens increased in the youngest mouse age-classes, reaching the highest value in mice around 8 months old and then declined in older age groups. The 'convex' shape of age - intensity curves was similar in male and female wood mice.
   5. There was strong seasonality in the population dynamics of host and parasite. Parasite prevalence was highest around April and intensity around May. The mouse population was at its 'youngest' from late summer into winter and 'oldest' in the late spring.
   6. We outline various mechanisms which might generate epidemiological patterns within these data and comparison is made with previous studies of H. polygyrus in A. sylvaticus and the laboratory mouse. Indirect evidence suggests that convexity may be created by acquired immunity and/or by parasite-induced host mortality.

TI A SIMULATION-MODEL OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF BARLEY YELLOW DWARF VIRUS IN
   WINTER SOWN CEREALS AND ITS APPLICATION TO FORECASTING
AB 1. A computer model is described which simulates the spread of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) by aphids in winter cereals in SW England. The model has as a theoretical base the dynamic interaction between two temperature-dependent rate processes: (i) the frequency of virus transmission to uninfected plants by infected aphids, and (ii) the frequency of virus acquisition by uninfected aphids from infected plants. A distinction is made between virus spread into crops by alate migrant vectors (primary transmission), and more localized spread within crops mainly by apterous vectors (secondary transmission). Both types of spread may occur concurrently. Probabilities of multiple infection, and effects of this on the rate processes in the model, are described by a generalized frequency distribution. Vector dispersal and the latent periods, following transmission and acquisition of virus, are represented as constant functions of thermal time.
   2. Simulations used field data of plant and aphid populations sampled every few weeks in crops of winter barley and wheat at Long Ashton near Bristol during 1978-89. The infectivity of autumn migrant aphids caught each year in a suction trap was measured by feeding transmission tests. Daily max-min screen temperatures used to estimate thermal time were obtained from records at Long Ashton. Crop infections were assessed from visible symptoms or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   3. The model was successfully validated for 61 cereal crops with 0-80% of the crop area affected. There was no significant divergence between field observations and incidence of BYDV as predicted by the model (barley, r = 0.98; wheat, r = 0.94). Curves of epidemic development obtained by measuring virus incidence at frequent intervals during crop growth were usually similar to those generated by the model. Prospects for practical and more reliable forecasting of BYDV epidemics, and of the need for control measures, are discussed.

TI THE EFFECT ON A BRITISH WILD RABBIT-POPULATION (ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS)
   OF MANIPULATING MYXOMATOSIS
AB 1. Myxomatosis no longer has the dramatic impact on rabbit numbers of the original outbreaks in 1953-55. The influence of the disease on rabbit numbers 25-30 years later was investigated by twice reducing and then restoring the prevalence of myxomatosis in a farmland population.
   2. Insecticide was used for 2 years to reduce the numbers of rabbit fleas, the main vector of the disease. Flea numbers were subsequently increased by systematic reintroductions over a further 2 years and the sequence was then repeated.
   3. Changes in the prevalence of myxomatosis followed the changes in flea numbers.
   4. Rabbit numbers increased by two- to threefold during the flea reduction periods, and fell in the reintroduction periods.
   5. The results suggest that the disease still has a considerable influence on rabbit numbers.

TI PARASITISM AS A CONSTRAINT ON THE RATE OF LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION
AB There are a number of ways in which a host can respond in evolutionary time to reductions in survival and reproduction due to a virulent parasite. These include evolving physiological morphological, or behavioural mechanisms of resistance to infection (or to proliferation, once infection has occurred). But a more unexpected tactic is also possible. This is for hosts to reproduce (slightly) sooner when in the presence of a virulent parasite as compared to when the parasite is less virulent or absent. As such, hosts which reproduce younger may be at a selective advantage, since they can both evade parasitism in time and, even when parasitised, can reduce the likely impact of the parasite on survival and reproductive success. We employ a simple mathematical model to propose that parasites and pathogens can act as important agents in the evolution of the timing of reproduction and associated life-history characters (e.g. body size). Once established in a semelparous host population, evolutionary increases in parasite virulence should result in the evolution of shorter lived hosts; whereas the evolution of less virulent forms of the parasite should be accompanied by the evolution of longer lived hosts. We argue that in the presence of a sufficiently virulent parasite the evolution of longer pre-reproductive life-spans should require the previous or concomitant evolution of morphological, behavioural or physiological resistance to parasitic infection and proliferation.

TI TESTS OF SIB DIVERSIFICATION THEORIES OF OUTCROSSING IN
   IMPATIENS-CAPENSIS - EFFECTS OF INBREEDING AND NEIGHBOR RELATEDNESS ON
   PRODUCTION AND INFESTATION
AB Several models of the evolution of genetic systems posit very strong frequency-dependent selection acting on small spatial scales; in such circumstances a genetically diverse sibship outperforms a genetically uniform sibship, and genes for mixis may spread in a population. Such selection regimes may derive from resource limitation and/or parasite transmission. We describe a greenhouse experiment designed to test these ideas, using the annual herb Impatiens capensis. Plants were potted in pairs; the genetic variance within pots was manipulated by using progeny from either inbred or outcrossed parents and by using either full sibs or unrelated individuals. Treatment combinations designed to increase genetic diversity resulted in greater phenotypic variance in both morphology and production, though not in the density of spider mites or whiteflies. Despite evidence of resource limitation, there was no effect of genetic diversity on productivity, nor was there an effect on infestation. These results fail to support either the sib competition or the sib contagion theory of outcrossing.

TI ADENOVIRUS INFECTION IN PEDIATRIC LIVER-TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS
AB A retrospective review of adenoviral infection in pediatric liver transplant recipients was done at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to define its epidemiology and clinical importance.  Medical records of patients with adenovirus were reviewed and data collected regarding clinical course, microbiologic studies, biopsy results, immunosuppression, concurrent infections, and outcome.  Of 484 liver transplant recipients, 49 had 53 episodes of adenoviral infection.  The most common sites of adenoviral infection were the liver, lung, and gastrointestinal tract.  Serotypes 1, 2, and 5 were recovered most often; type 5 was commonly associated with hepatitis.  Invasive adenoviral infection occurred in 20 children, leading to death in 9.  Median time from transplantation until isolation of adenovirus was 25.5 days.  This timing suggests either reactivation or donor-associated transmission.  Prospective studies using molecular epidemiologic techniques will be helpful in evaluating transmission patterns of adenovirus in this population.

TI HYBRID ZONES AND HOST-PARASITE RELATIONSHIPS - EFFECT ON THE EVOLUTION
   OF PARASITIC SPECIFICITY
AB In southern France, Diplozoon gracile (Monogenea, Polyopisthocotylea), parasitizes four sympatric cyprinids.  One of these host species, Barbus meridionalis, naturally hybridizes with another species of barbel, Barbus, barbus, which is never parasitized by D. gracile under natural conditions.  This hybridization has previously been studied and described as an introgression of B. barbus by B. meridionalis.  The hybrids are parasitized by D. gracile, and parasite prevalence increases in proportion to the introgression rate, i.e., the percentage of B. meridionalis genes.  The causes for this preferential distribution of the parasite in the hybrid population are analysed on the basis of ecological and ethological differences between the two parent species.

TI DEVELOPMENTAL EXPRESSION OF PROTEIN-KINASE-C ACTIVITY IN
   SCHISTOSOMA-MANSONI
AB The multicellular parasite Schistosoma mansoni undergoes complex physiologic changes during development from infective cercariae to adult worms in the mammalian host. The present study examined changes in protein kinase C (PKC) activity in S. mansoni during parasite maturation. Activation of PKC required Ca+2, phosphatidylserine, and either diacylglycerol or phorbol ester similar to mammalian PKC enzyme. A nine-fold increase in total PKC activity was found in adult worms as compared with larval parasites. Transformation of infective cercariae to parasitic schistosomula was associated with translocation of PKC activity from the cytosolic to membrane fraction. Tegumental extracts demonstrated significant PKC activity, suggesting a signal transduction system in the surface of the parasite. These data indicate that PKC activity is differentially expressed during parasite development and may have critical roles in regulation of cellular events in S. mansoni.

The median number of sexual partners (lifetime) was highest for men aged 30-34 years (eight partners) and for women aged 25-29 years (seven partners). After adjustment for age and sex, having had greater-than-or-equal-to 5 sexual partners in the past year was strongly associated with living in larger cities, intravenous drug use, and having sex with a prostitute, a bisexual man, an intravenous drug user, or a resident of sub-Saharan Africa. The frequency of ever having had anal intercourse was highest among women aged 20-34 years (range, 27%-36%) and was independently associated only with increasing number of sexual partners (lifetime). Overall, 2.7% of men reported any homosexual experience, among whom most (88%) had also had heterosexual intercourse. Prostitute contact (ever) was reported by 13% of all men and was associated with a high educational level, a history of travel, a greater number of sexual partners, and intravenous drug use. Overall, sexual contact with someone considered at high risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (a homosexual/bisexual man, intravenous drug user, prostitute, or sub-Saharan African resident) was reported by 15.9% of men and 4.8% of women. Among active blood donors (past year), 12.5% of men and 4.0% of women had engaged in potentially risky behavior. HIV testing was deliberately sought more often by respondents exposed to someone at increased risk of HIV infection (10.6%) than by those unexposed (6.5%, p < 0.01). Exposure to persons at risk of HIV infection is considerable in Denmark. The majority of persons who have had potential exposure to HIV have not yet been tested for HIV.

Four related sequences have been obtained for microorganisms carried by eight isofemale lines representative of the three mitochondrial types of D. simulans.

AB In a cross-sectional house-to-house study in a leishmaniasis-endemic area in Kenya, the cellular and humoral immune response to Leishmania lipophosphoglycan (LPG) was determined. Clinical data, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and plasma were obtained from 50 individuals over the age of eight years. Lymphoproliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by these cells were examined. It was shown that cells from all six individuals in the population with a history of kala-azar responded to LPG in the lymphocyte proliferation assay. and four of these six responded in the IFN-gamma assay. In contrast, cells from 12 of 44 individuals from the study area with no history of kala-azar and none of the five Danish control samples responded to LPG. Antibodies against LPG were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 45 of 50 plasma samples. Our findings clearly show that mononuclear cells from kala-azar patients cured of infection were able to respond to the LPG preparation. The finding of a specific cellular immune response to LPG in 12 of 44 individuals with no history of kala-azar is consistent with previous epidemiologic studies, in which it has been shown that a proportion of L. donovani infections run a subclinical course. The high frequency of individuals with antibodies against LPG might indicate that a majority of the population had been exposed to the parasite. The soluble L. donovani antigen gave rise to proliferation and IFN-gamma production in cell samples from all individuals with a history of kala-azar, in three of five cell samples from Danish controls with no known exposure to Leishmania, and in 36 of 44 samples from members of the study population with no history of kala-azar. In contrast, the response to LPG seemed highly specific.

TI AN IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL STUDY OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF RIFT-VALLEY FEVER
   VIRUS IN THE MOSQUITO CULEX-PIPIENS
AB The dissemination of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus in females of the epidemic vector Culex pipiens was studied immunocytochemically. Among orally infected specimens, viral antigen was detected in all major midgut regions, although individuals varied with respect to which regions were infected. Among specimens with disseminated infections (infections beyond the midgut epithelium), antigen was detected in most tissues, including those of the nervous and endocrine systems. However, no antigen was found in the ovarian follicular epithelia, oocytes/nurse cells, or female accessory gland. A viral dissemination index (DI) based on several tissues was determined for each orally infected specimen and used to estimate the extent of viral dissemination in the hemocoel. Plots of DI values as a function of time after ingestion of an infectious blood meal indicated that dissemination was sporadic, and that once virus escapes from the midgut, its spread to other tissues is rapid. The most common sequence of tissue/organ infection following escape of virus from the midgut epithelium appears to be as follows: intussuscepted foregut, fat body, salivary glands and thoracic ganglia, epidermis, and ommatidia of the compound eyes. Reduced fecundity and survival identified in other studies of RVF virus-infected Cx. pipiens are probably explainable on the basis of extensive tissue and organ infection resulting in an overall energy drain. Infection of regulatory tissues and organs such as the ganglia of the central nervous system, neurosecretory cells, and the corpora allata may also have detrimental effects on the overall functioning of a mosquito, even in the absence of widespread infection.

TI ON THE SPATIAL SPREAD OF INSECT PATHOGENS - THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB The mathematical theory of animal diseases has seen explosive growth in the past decade, yet most of the existing theory examines only temporal disease spread, ignoring the effects of patchy host or pathogen spatial distributions.  Here I present a model for the within-season spatial spread of insect pathogens that incorporates host movement in an otherwise conventional insect host-pathogen model.  Mathematical analysis of the model reveals that the pathogen will spread through the host population in a moving wave front of disease, known as a "travelling wave."  This analysis shows how the spatial rate of spread of the pathogen depends upon the transmission rate of the disease, the rate of production of the pathogen by infected hosts, the initial population of the host, the decay rate of the pathogen, and the death rate of infected hosts.
   To test the predictions of the model, I performed a series of field experiments with the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata.  First, I estimated each of the parameters of the model in the field with a series of small-scale experiments, and used the parameter estimates to predict the spatial rate of spread of the NPV through a population of tussock moth larvae (NPV diseases, like many insect pathogens, do not infect adults).  To test this prediction, I then performed an experiment in which I measured the rate of spread of the NPV in an experimental population of tussock moth larvae on linear arrays of Douglas-fir seedlings.  The model predicts the rate of spread of tussock moth NPV fairly accurately, suggesting that one can use this type of model to extrapolate individual behavior and localized transmission patterns to broader-scale spatial dynamics.

TI DENSITY-DEPENDENT HOST PATHOGEN DYNAMICS IN SOIL MICROCOSMS
AB Temporal density-dependent parasitism and a host threshold density are important features of disease induced by infectious parasites in populations of aboveground, macroscopic organisms.  We determined whether these features also occur in soil microcosms containing a microscopic host (the nematode Heterodera schachtii) and its parasite (the nematophagous fungus Hirsutella rhossiliensis).  Soil microcosms are especially interesting because (1) the environment and scale are quite different from conventional host-parasite systems and may result in considerably different disease dynamics, (2) the small size of the soil microcosms, although biologically appropriate, facilitates experimentation and parameter estimation, and (3) some soil-borne, microscopic organisms (such as H. schachtii) are important agricultural pests.
   Temporal density-dependent parasitism was directly assessed with laboratory experiments in which host density and environment were controlled.  A theory, which complements and extends the experiments, was developed to enable direct comparison of observed and predicted dynamics and to provide a stringent test of our understanding of processes underlying the dynamics.  The theory was simple, yet explicitly described the essential biology.  Parameters for the theory were measured with short-term experiments.
   We found that the disease dynamics in soil microcosms exhibited both temporal density-dependent parasitism and a host threshold density.  However, epidemics were slow to develop.  Observed and predicted dynamics were quite similar, indicating that our understanding of the underlying biology was correct.

TI INTERACTIONS OF INTRASPECIFIC, INTERSPECIFIC, AND APPARENT COMPETITION
   WITH HOST PATHOGEN POPULATION-DYNAMICS
AB I investigated the interactions of intra- and interspecific competition with parasitism for populations of two terrestrial isopods, Porcellio scaber and Porcellio laevis, infected with a lethal virus.  In field experiments, I varied densities of one or both isopod species in enclosures in which food and virus presence were also manipulated.  I estimated the effects of intra- and interspecific competition, additional food, and virus infection on both the survival of P. scaber and the prevalence of the virus.  In uninfected populations, intraspecific and interspecific competition negatively affected isopod survival, although food resources had no effect.  In infected treatments, interspecific competition produced higher levels of virus prevalence than did intraspecific competition.  Virus infection and reduced food interacted to produce higher overall mortality in interspecific competition treatments than in intraspecific competition treatments.  The lack of significant effect of food on competition suggests that interference interactions rather than resource competition predominated.  This mechanism is supported by a laboratory study in which total food availability was controlled.  These results indicate that competition and parasitism interacted to produce the observed mortality patterns, and that ignoring mortality due to the virus would produce apparent interspecific competition.  The data suggest that the impact of P. laevis on P. scaber involves both direct and indirect effects.

Case-patients ranged in age from 4 to 36 years; the highest attack rate (6.4%) was for children aged 5-9 years. A case-control study revealed that case-patients were more likely than controls to have swum in a public swimming pool on Saturday afternoon (19/19 vs 26/38; odds ratio [OR], undefined; lower 95% confidence limit, 1.7). Case-patients were more likely than controls to have swum in the jacuzzi pool (16/19 vs. 10/26; OR, 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-47.1) or adult pool A (19/19 vs. 15/26; OR, undefined; lower 95% confidence limit, 2.6). Case-patients were also more likely to have swum for > 1 h and to have put their heads under the water. Because of the design of the filtering system of adult pool A, a cross-connection between a sewage line and the pool water intake line was possible. This outbreak may have been caused by transmission of hepatitis A through swimming; thus, swimming may serve as a mode of transmission of hepatitis A virus, especially among small children.

TI INTRACELLULAR SYMBIONTS AND THE EVOLUTION OF UNIPARENTAL CYTOPLASMIC
   INHERITANCE
AB Uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic elements is widespread among eukaryotic organisms and is achieved by a diverse range of mechanisms. This paper shows that the cytoplasmic genetic system would be expected to evolve towards uniparental inheritance, given the existence of deleterious symbionts capable of invading the host cytoplasm together with nuclear genes that lead to the elimination of cytoplasmic elements from one of the gamete types. The reason for this is that, under biparental inheritance, foreign symbionts with strong deleterious effects are able to spread through host populations. A nuclear modifier gene which leads to the loss of cytoplasmic elements from one gamete type gains a net advantage as a symbiont spreads, because the modifier sometimes gives rise to a symbiont-free zygote. In so far as small gametes reduce the rate of symbiont transmission to the zygote, modifier genes causing small gamete size would tend to accumulate, so that cytoplasmic inheritance would become associated with maternal rather than paternal gametes. Once uniparental inheritance predominates in the host population, the population is protected from invasions by a large class of harmful symbionts, but at the same time those symbionts that benefit their hosts are still able to increase in frequency.

TI MYCOPHAGOUS DROSOPHILA AND THEIR NEMATODE PARASITES
AB The nematode Howardula aoronymphium (Allantonematidae) parasitizes several mushroom-feeding species of Drosophila of the quinaria and testacea species groups in eastern North America. The principal effect of nematodes on their hosts is a reduction in female fertility: females of Drosophila putrida and Drosophila testacea are sterilized by these parasites. The prevalence of parasitism varies substantially among host species and through time, showing evidence of seasonal as well as year-to-year variation. Because the principal effect of these parasites is on host reproduction and because they are not highly aggregated among hosts, this parasite-host system may be prone to unstable population dynamics. Some field evidence suggests that H. aoronymphium may influence the outcome of competition among its host species. Because these parasites and their hosts have similar population sizes, generation times. and rates of gene flow, they may interact evolutionarily in a dynamically interesting manner.

TI PARASITISM AND THE DYNAMICS OF UNGULATE GRAZING SYSTEMS
AB This study examines the potential impact of directly transmitted macroparasites on the population dynamics of ungulate grazing systems. It combines simple, previously published mathematical models for plant-herbivore and host-parasite interactions in a model that captures the essential features of the plant-herbivore-parasite system. The most ecologically complex and interesting case, in which herbivore numbers are food limited and allowed to vary more or less naturally, is considered in detail. On one hand, this analysis confirms the potential role of parasites as functional "top predators" and in particular the potential of parasite-induced host mortality to increase the plant equilibrium of otherwise overgrazed systems. This result underlines the dangers of indiscriminate anthelmintic application in marginal grazing systems without a consideration of the possible ecological consequences of parasite control. By contrast, the analysis also underlines two unique features of parasitism in the context of grazing system dynamics. First, the effect of the coupling of gut parasite transmission to food consumption simplifies grazing system dynamics by linearizing the herbivore's functional response near the parasite equilibrium. Second, the destabilizing impact of parasite-induced reductions in host reproductive rate can throw the system into chaotic plant-herbivore-parasite cycles. The ecological implications of these results are discussed.

   ORAL-CANCER IN MEN
AB A population-based case-control study was conducted in western Washington state to examine the relations between infection with human papilloma viruses (HPV), herpes simplex viruses (HSV), and risk of oral squamous cell cancer in men. Interviews were completed on 131 oral cancer cases diagnosed between January 1985 and December 1989 and 136 controls frequency matched to cases on age and date of diagnosis who were obtained by random digit dialing. The risk for oral cancer among men with 30 or more sexual partners was 2.4 times that of men with four or fewer partners (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-5.9). Men who ever practiced oral sex had lower risk for oral cancer relative to men who never practiced oral sex (relative risk (RR) = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8). Analyses of exfoliated oral cavity cells for the presence of HPV-6 DNA with polymerase chain reaction revealed that men with an oral HPV-6 infection had 2.9 times the risk for oral cancer of noninfected men (95% CI 1.1-7.3), whereas men with an oral HPV-16 infection had 6.2 times the risk for oral cancer of noninfected men (crude RR = 6.2, 95% CI 0.7-52.2). Relative risks associated with serologically detected HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections were 0.8 (95% CI 0.3-1.7) and 1.8 (95% CI 0.7-4.6), respectively. The authors conclude that HPV-6 is associated with oral cancer. Although men infected with HPV-16 and HSV-2 were at elevated risk, these associations may have been due to chance. The role of specific sexual practices in the transmission of viruses to the oral cavity remains unclear.

TI METHODS FOR INFERENCE ON TRANSMISSION IN SEROPREVALENCE DATA FOR
   MULTIPLE INFECTIONS
AB When risk factors for an infectious disease are unknown, a method commonly employed is to investigate parallels with known infections (covariate infections). Data sets of value here are those for specified populations in which the seroprevalence of antibodies for multiple infections has been ascertained, The use of markers of covariate infections in multivariable analyses is problematic when the covariate infection is not itself an independent risk factor for the outcome of interest. In the performance of these analyses, the authors recommend the following strategy: 1) For estimates of the effects of measured risk factors on the outcome, adjustment for the covariate infection should not be done; this will avoid problems of overadjustment. 2) After control for the measured risk factors, an estimate of the "effect" of the covariate infection may be used as an indicator of the presence of unmeasured shared risk factors. 3) When shared, measured risk factors exist, the authors propose the use of methods developed for analysis of repeated measures of categorical variables to assist in inference about shared mechanisms of action of these risk factors. This analytic strategy takes advantage of the method of analogy for building understanding of transmission of new agents through their parallels with better known ones and is useful in the development of hypotheses.

TI INTRAGENOMIC CONFLICT AS AN EVOLUTIONARY FORCE

Here I synthesize a body of past work, and argue that intragenomic conflict might be an important evolutionary force. I discuss the evolutionary history of cytoplasmic genes as an illustration. I first consider the evolution of sex. Recent evidence suggests that the initial evolution of sex might have been driven by an ultra-selfish gene. The existence of sex in turn creates a series of new conflicts which may explain the existence of sexes and uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic genes. Uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic genes sets up a new set of conflicts over the sex ratio, which in turn may influence the evolution of sex determining systems, sex allocation systems and post-zygotic isolating mechanisms.

TI MOSQUITO BLOOD FEEDING PATTERNS AS A FACTOR IN THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF
   JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS IN SOUTHERN INDIA
AB Determinations were made of the source of 16, 330 bloodmeals from 10 species of Culex mosquitoes, including recognized vectors of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, in two epidemiologically distinct areas in southern India. In Madurai, where cases occurred sporadically and pigs were reared only in some villages, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx. vishnui had fed predominantly on cattle (89.2-91%), but less frequently on humans (2.1- 6.2%) and on pigs and ardeid birds (0-0.1%). In Nallur, which was endemic for JE and had a large pig population, 4.4-5.4% of the feedings were on these hosts. Cattle feedings accounted for 84.6-88% of the total feedings, human feedings for 2.4-6.2%, but there were no ardeid-positive feedings. Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui showed a marked increase in the proportion of human feedings during the hot season, due to increased availability of humans sleeping outdoors to mainly exophagic mosquitoes. Feeding indices were corrected for spatial and temporal concurrence of hosts in each season, but these factors were found to require further elucidation. Discrepancies in the relative abundance of vectors as monitored by two different methods are discussed in the light of these observations.

   INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN AN ENDEMIC AREA OF THE CONGO
AB A followup of Loa loa and Mansonella perstans microfilaremia was carried out in an adult population living in a highly endemic area of the Congo. Infection rates and parasite loads were found to be stable in the general population, both in the short-term (two months) and long-term (3-4 years) followup. The microfilarial status of most of the subjects examined did not change between tests. At the individual level, the microfilarial densities of L. loa and M. perstans also remained remarkably constant over time. This results in a qualitative and quantitative stability of the parasitic material available for the vectors.

TI LOW-FREQUENCY OF ANTI-PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM CIRCUMSPOROZOITE REPEAT
   ANTIBODIES AND RATE OF HIGH MALARIA TRANSMISSION IN ENDEMIC AREAS OF
   RONDONIA STATE IN NORTHWESTERN BRAZIL
AB In areas studied in the Rondonia State of Brazil, a high Mte of malaria transmission and a low prevalence of anti-(NANP)4 antibodies are reported. The entomologic data are comparable to those observed in some malaria-endemic areas of Africa and Asia. However, the frequency of individuals with antibodies to the immunodominant epitope of the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum recorded in the four localities of Rondonia state was very low when compared with the frequencies recorded in other African and Asian endemic areas. Most of the studies performed in Africa and Asia concerned the native population of hyperendemic areas, whereas we studied a migrant population who were mostly from malaria-free areas of Brazil and living in Rondonia State for 2-4 years. In positive individuals the antibody production was influenced by previous malaria experience, suggesting that infective bites must occur in cumulative numbers before anti-(NANP)4 antibodies are detected. Therefore, it is possible that the individuals described in this report have not been exposed long enough to malaria infection to develop detectable levels of anti-(NANP)4 antibodies.

TI DISEASE AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE - THE IMPORTANCE OF HOST SELF-REGULATION
   IN A HOST-HOST-PATHOGEN MODEL
AB A model is examined of two hosts sharing a directly transmitted pathogen where for the first time both hosts are also subject to self-regulation. The model provides insights into the manner in which self- and pathogen regulation combine in determining the coexistence or otherwise of hosts and the structure of biological communities generally. A number of outcomes are possible: coexistence of both hosts with the pathogen, coexistence of both hosts without the pathogen, the predictable elimination of one host by the other, which then remains with the pathogen, and the elimination of either host by the other, contingent on initial densities. However, whereas without self-regulation coexistence of both hosts with their shared pathogen can only be achieved by the partitioning of enemy-free space, with self-regulation there is a wider range of paths, including coexistence mediated by the hosts' resources (analogous to "exploiter-mediated coexistence"), coexistence mediated by interspecific transmission, and coexistence arising when elements of these other mechanisms are combined. Also, a more affected, "regulated-alone" host can eliminate a less affected, "nonregulated-alone" host, but not vice versa; whereas without self-regulation only the opposite outcome is possible. The incorporation of self-regulation adds a necessary element of realism.

TI THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF VARICELLA ZOSTER VIRUS-INFECTIONS - A
   MATHEMATICAL-MODEL
AB Herpes-zoster is caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV).  In this paper different hypotheses of how this re-emergence of virus comes about are reviewed and discussed.  From these hypotheses, and epidemiological data describing the initial transmission of the virus, a mathematical model of primary disease (varicella) and reactivated disease (zoster) in developed countries is derived.  The steady-state age distribution of zoster cases predicted by this model are compared with the observed distribution, derived from a review and analysis of published epidemiological data.  The model allows differentiation between published hypotheses in which age of host may or may not influence the probability of viral reactivation.  The results indicate that the probability of reactivation must increase with age to allow the observed pattern of zoster cases. The basic mathematical model presented provides a conceptual framework, which may be extended to assess possible control programmes.

TI ALTERATIONS IN THE COURSE OF EXPERIMENTAL SYPHILIS ASSOCIATED WITH
   CONCURRENT SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS-INFECTION
AB Case reports suggest that the course of syphilis is altered in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To investigate this issue, a model of syphilis in rhesus macaques with and without simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was developed. After intradermal inoculation with Treponema pallidum, 2 SIV-infected monkeys had persistent ulcerative primary lesions and 1 developed secondary syphilis. Two SIV-uninfected controls developed transient nonulcerative primary lesions. Only the controls showed consistent VDRL antibody responses. In contrast, reciprocal antibody titers to T. pallidum detected by microhemagglutination were higher in SIV-infected animals (greater-than-or-equal-to 20,480) than controls (greater-than-or-equal-to 1280). All 4 animals developed a full range of T. pallidum antigen-specific antibodies shown by immunoblot and had similar peak lymphocyte proliferative responses to T. pallidum antigens. These results support the contention that retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency delays clearance of T. pallidum from sites of infection and may impair the humoral immune response to syphilis.

TI RECOMBINANT PORIN OF HAEMOPHILUS-INFLUENZAE TYPE-B
AB A protein of approximately 40 kDa in the outer membrane of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) behaves as a porin and permits transmembrane diffusion of low-molecular-weight solutes. The gene for Hib porin was cloned from an M13 library of chromosomal DNA of Hib strain ATCC 9795. The gene was subcloned into a new transfer vector as a prerequisite for its use in the baculovirus expression vector system. Pure recombinant virus (AcPORIN) was isolated. On infection of a cultivated insect cell line Sf9 with AcPORIN, a novel protein was detected in cell lysates, and this novel protein reacted with an anti-Hib porin monoclonal antibody. The purified recombinant Hib porin was tested for its pore-forming properties in a synthetic black lipid membrane. The biophysical activity of purified recombinant Hib porin was identical to porin isolated from the bacterial outer membrane.

   DISEASE - PULMONARY CLEARANCE SYSTEMS
AB Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae are increasingly being recognized as an important cause of disease in the lower respiratory tract. Information about the pathogenesis of these infections has been limited until recently by the paucity of experimental animal models for studying the host-parasite interaction in vivo. Three different animal models for investigation of the interaction of nontypeable H. influenzae with the lower respiratory tract have been used: Two involve the evaluation of short-term pulmonary clearance in mice or rats, while a new, long-term infection model in rats mimics the more chronic bronchopulmonary infections sometimes caused by these organisms. Results obtained in these three model systems indicate that both humoral and cellular immune mechanisms are involved in immunity to lower respiratory tract disease due to nontypeable H. influenzae.

TI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF INVASIVE HAEMOPHILUS-INFLUENZAE TYPE-B DISEASE
AB Invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is typically a disease of young children, starting when the protection afforded by maternal antibodies is exhausted and ending when the child's own antibody production to the Hib capsular polysaccharide begins efficiently. There are, however, large variations between population groups in the incidence of the disease and the age at which it appears. Potential factors behind this variation include virulence genes of the bacteria and genetic susceptibility genes of the host. Although such genes and their effects can be identified, their impact on the disease's incidence is only minor. Potentially much more important appear to be socioeconomic factors that to a large extent determine the exposure of the child to Hib and to other infectious agents that may enhance both colonization and invasive infection by Hib.

TI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF GIARDIASIS IN WISCONSIN - INCREASING INCIDENCE OF
   REPORTED CASES AND UNEXPLAINED SEASONAL TRENDS
AB Giardia lamblia is the most commonly reported enteric pathogen in Wisconsin. Since giardiasis became a notifiable disease, the annual number of cases reported to the Wisconsin Division of Health has increased more than 20-fold, from 2.2 cases per 100,000 population in 1981 to 49.1 cases per 100,000 population in 1988. To better understand the nature of this increasing trend, we reviewed records of G. lamblia infections reported to the Wisconsin Division of Health from 1981 to 1988. Although the increase in reported cases was a general phenomenon that was not limited to a few high-risk groups, the highest annual incidence and greatest increase occurred in children 1-4 years old; 34% of the cases in this age group occurred in children who attended day care centers. A remarkably consistent late summer (August) increase was observed across all demographic and risk groups, suggesting that G. lamblia may be more common in the environment during late summer, or that risk factors for transmission may differ during these months. Additional studies are needed to further explain the increasing incidence and seasonal nature of reported giardiasis and to identify opportunities for prevention.

   (MUS-MUSCULUS) DISTRIBUTION IN URBAN BALTIMORE
AB Four hundred eighty house mice (Mus musculus) were trapped primarily from urban sites in Baltimore, Maryland from 1984 to 1989 and tested for antibody to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The majority of mice (95%) were trapped in residences at two city locations (n = 260), or in an urban park (n = 196); five additional sites were sampled. Overall, 9.0% of the mice were LCMV antibody positive and infected animals were obtained from six of eight sites, including all three of the primary city sites, where the prevalence varied significantly (3.9-13.4%). The location with the highest prevalence was an inner city residential site where positive mice were found significantly clustered within blocks and households. In this location, LCMV antibody prevalence was also significantly correlated with estimates of mouse density within individual blocks. The focal nature of LCMV infection in house mice may result from contact or vertical transmission of virus in conjunction with the highly structured social system of mice, which promotes inbreeding and limited dispersal.

   BRAZILIAN AMERINDIANS
AB Evidence for human T cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) was sought in sera and cells collected from adults in 13 isolated South and Central American indian tribes. Serologic tests identified frequent HTLV-II-like reactivity among the Cayapo and Kraho tribes, who live 330 km apart in Central Brazil. Polymerase chain reaction analyses of viral DNA in cell pellet and plasma fractions confirmed the virus as HTLV-II. Both tribes speak Ge and, at the time of blood collection (1974), subsisted as hunter/gatherers and slash and burn agriculturalists. Further testing of plasma from Cayapo and Kraho of all ages revealed overall HTLV-II prevalence rates of 33.3% and 12.2%, respectively, with increasing prevalence associated with age and female gender. These data reveal for the first time a high prevalence of HTLV-II infection in remote South American Indians with little contact with non-Indians. Thus, HTLV-II is postulated to be an ancient human virus in the New World.

TI NONVASCULAR DELIVERY OF RIFT-VALLEY FEVER VIRUS BY INFECTED MOSQUITOS
AB To determine whether virus-transmitting mosquitoes inoculate infectious particles extravascularly or directly into the vascular system, we permitted mosquitoes infected with Rift Valley fever virus to feed on the distal third of the tails of suckling mice. Amputation of the distal half of the tail within 5 min after their being bitten significantly increased mouse survival as compared with that of mice whose tails remained intact. Even when tails were amputated 10 or more min after mosquito feeding, the median time to death was significantly longer in the group with the amputated tails (53.5 hr) than in those mice with intact tails (46.0 hr). Mouse survival did not correlate with ingestion of blood by the infecting mosquito. We conclude that mosquitoes inoculate virus extravascularly, rather than directly into the vascular system, when feeding on a vertebrate host. Such extravascular delivery of virus by a transmitting mosquito may affect viral pathogenesis, antiviral activity, and vaccine efficacy.

TI SALIVARY ANTIBODY TESTING IN A SCHOOL OUTBREAK OF HEPATITIS-A
AB During a community-wide outbreak of hepatitis A in Gloucester. UK there was a high attack rate in children attending two city primary schools and a pre-school centre sharing the same site. In September 1990, saliva specimens were collected from 478 (85%) of the 562 children. The prevalence of antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV), as determined by saliva testing, was 29.6%; highest prevalences were seen in 5.6-year-olds and in children from that area of the city at the centre of the community-wide outbreak. The proportion of immune children with a history of clinical hepatitis varied with age from 1 in 42.7 of under-5-year-olds to 1 in 4.7 of 8-10-year-olds. Six children who received prophylaxis with human normal immune globulin (HNIG) because they were household contacts of cases subsequently became infected. Since there was evidence of transmission outside the school environment it is unlikely that a policy of universal prophylaxis within the schools would have stopped the outbreak. Mass prophylaxis in school outbreaks is only likely to be effective if most transmission is occurring at school and if the target population can be clearly defined.
   Salivary antibody testing is a simple, practical and acceptable procedure in young children. Salivary antibody surveys in conjunction with vaccination against hepatitis A should provide a cost-effective method for control of future outbreaks.

TI MOLECULAR-GENETICS OF ADAPTATION IN AN EXPERIMENTAL-MODEL OF COOPERATION
AB The evolution of cooperation was studied in an empirical system utilizing a parasitic bacteriophage (f1) and a bacterial host. Infected cells were propagated by serial passage so that a phage could increase its representation among infected hosts only by enhancing the rate of growth of its host. Loss of infectivity was therefore without selective penalty, and phage benevolence could potentially evolve through a variety of genetic changes. The infected hosts evolved to grow faster over the course of the study, but the genetic bases of this phenotypic change were more difficult to anticipate. Two fundamentally different types of genetic changes in the phage were revealed. One involved the loss of some phage genes, resulting in a noninfectious plasmid that continued to replicate via the parental phage replicon. The second change involved integration of the phage genome into host DNA by a process that, at low frequency, could be reversed to produce infectious phage particles. Integration is a previously unknown property of wild-type f1, and in the system studied, may have resulted from the use of a phage bearing an insert containing nonfunctional DNA. The evolution of this novel function apparently depended only on the presence of a small region in the phage genome that provided some homology to the host DNA, with the host providing all necessary functions. Although f1 is one of the simplest phages known, these observations suggest that host-parasite interactions of the filamentous phages are more complicated than previously thought. More generally, the fl system offers a useful model for many problems concerning the genetic basis of adaptation.

TI SCHISTOSOMA-MANSONI INFECTION IN DIAPAUSING BIOMPHALARIA-GLABRATA SNAILS
   - STUDIES OF TEMPERATURE AND GENETIC INFLUENCES ON DIAPAUSING BEHAVIOR
AB Snails that are capable of undergoing diapause can circumvent unfavorable environmental conditions, including long periods of drought. Studies were performed to investigate possible temperature and/or genetic factors that may trigger lamella formation and diapausing behavior. The influence of diapause in Biomphalaria glabrata snails on susceptibility to Schistosoma mansoni infection and levels of cercarial production was also investigated. Rearing temperatures of 23-degrees-C or higher did not induce lamella formation or diapause, regardless of the parental phenotype. However, substantial percentages of progeny from lamellated or lamellated/diapausing parental snails developed lamellae at 18-degrees-C and underwent diapause. Only a small percentage of offspring from nonlamellated parents formed lamellae at this temperature. Juvenile snails exposed just prior to diapause, or immediately following a diapause period of three weeks, were highly susceptible to infection by S. mansoni miracidia. Snails that underwent diapause produced comparable or only slightly fewer cercariae than did nondiapausing snails. These studies indicate that diapause in B. glabrata does little to decrease a snail's ability to act as an intermediate host for S. mansoni or to interrupt the development of the parasite. For these reasons, we believe that greater attention should be given to diapausing snail populations when planning field surveys or mollusciciding programs.

TI MUTUALISM WITH POLLINATING SEED PARASITES AMID CO-POLLINATORS -
   CONSTRAINTS ON SPECIALIZATION
AB The genus Greya is closely related to the yucca moths, and Greya species interact with their host plants in many of the same ways as yucca moths. Females both pollinate and oviposit in the flowers of their host. Unlike yucca moths, however, pollinating Greya species share flowers with co-pollinators that do not oviposit on the host. We studied the interaction between Greya politella (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) and Lithophragma parviflorum (Hook.) Torr. & Gray (Saxifragaceae) to evaluate the effect on seed output of a pollinating seed parasite against a background of co-pollinators.
   Flowers were visited and pollinated mostly by bombyliid flies, solitary bees, and G. politella. Bombyliid flies alone composed 68-88% of the 5522 visits recorded over 2 yr. Although both male and female G. politella visited the flowers and probed for nectar, pollination by this species occurred only as females oviposited through the corolla tube, thereby passively transferring to the stigma pollen adhering to the abdomen. Visitation to flowers by all pollinators averaged 0.3-1.9 visits/h during daylight hours. Consequently, most flowers were visited multiple times during the several days that stigmas were receptive, and 77% of the flowers tagged during the 4 yr had some developing seeds. Pollination did not depend upon visitation by G. politella. Flowers receiving G. politella eggs had the same probability of producing some seed and the same mean number of developing seeds as flowers visited only by other insects.
   Most flowers received the eggs of only one G. politella female, and the larvae ate 15-27% of the developing seeds. The final number of mature seeds remaining in attacked flowers did not differ from unattacked flowers except at one site in 1 yr, in which the values for attacked plants were marginally lower. Other sources of variation affecting seed output masked the effects of seed consumption by Greya.
   Overall, G. politella females have the potential to be mutualistic with L. parviflorum: they are effective pollinators, generally visit most plants and about half the flowers in the population, and impose a fairly small cost on seed output. Nonetheless, the abundant and effective co-pollinators, which do not eat the developing seeds, swamp Greya's mutualistic effects. Under the current conditions at Granite Point, the relationship between G. politella and L. parviflorum may be mostly commensalistic. The evolution of specialization to G. politella as an exclusive pollinator would seem to be possible only in L. parviflorum populations in which effective co-pollinators were either rare or unpredictable. That is, the potential for the evolution of specificity in this mutualism appears to depend upon the community context in which the interaction takes place rather than upon the simple outcome of the pairwise interaction between Greya and Lithophragma.

TI POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF BACTERIOPHAGE AND BACILLUS-SUBTILIS IN SOIL
AB The dynamics of the interaction of populations of Bacillus subtilis and a temperate bacteriophage in soil microorganisms were examined. The purpose of the study was to investigate these dynamics in a structured habitat approaching that of their natural habitat in soil, in contrast to previous investigations in broth or chemostats. We addressed three main questions. What are the population dynamics of a phage-bacteria interaction in soil? What role might the heterogeneity of the soil play in shaping the interaction? Are the dynamics controlled more by the population biology of the phage or of the bacteria?
   The phage used was isolated from Arizona desert soil in which B. subtilis is common. Phage and bacteria were grown separately or together in sterile soil microcosms consisting of autoclaved soil rich in organic material. Densities of phage and bacteria were estimated through repeated sterile sampling of the microcosms by spreading precise dilutions of sampled soil suspensions onto plates of microbiological media. The plates for estimation of phage densities contained in addition a lawn of host bacteria. While the principal focus is on temperate phage ecology, the dynamics of a single example of interaction between B. subtilis and virulent phage is also presented. In all cases an initial epidemic of phage occurred, followed by stable equilibria lasting weeks to months. A threshold host density for phage outbreak occurs at almost-equal-to 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per gram of soil. At equilibrium the phage, both temperate and virulent, were much less abundant than the bacteria. The temperate phage did not depress the equilibrium host density, while the virulent phage lowered it by a factor of ten. The acidic soil of these experiments caused rapid and permanent inactivation of free phage, making the continuous interaction of phage and host essential for persistence of phage. Low levels of phage resistance (superimmunity or genetic) were typical of host populations.
   Most properties of the interaction between B. subtilis and phage in soil are quite different from those observed with chemostat populations of Escherichia coli and virulent phages. Potential doubling times and rates of increase in soil for phage and B. subtilis were calculated. At equilibrium, soil slows the interaction of phage and host relative to population growth in broth culture, and possibly also makes it heterogeneous in space and time. The life-history features of B. subtilis and temperate phage are considerably more complex than those of non-sporeforming bacteria and virulent phage. The biotic relationship of temperate phage and host may be distinct from predation or parasitism. Patterns in the ecology and evolution of temperate and virulent phage were explored, leading to the expectation that temperate forms will be more common among the phages of soil bacteria.

   FETAL DNA
AB Pediatric AIDS is increasing in frequency due to a rise in the number of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected women of childbearing age. Because outcome studies reveal that most children infected peripartum manifest HIV-1-related disease in the first year of life, intrauterine infection has been suspected. Fetal tissues from 23 second-trimester abortuses were examined. The presence of HIV-1 nucleic acid sequences was determined by the polymerase chain reaction and used to define infection of the fetus. By analysis of available tissues, 7 of 23 fetuses were infected, while control fetal tissue was negative. In situ hybridization for HIV-1 DNA showed that only 1 of 8 infected abortuses was positive, while all samples of noninfected tissues revealed no HIV-1 DNA. These studies indicate that maternofetal transmission of HIV-1 may occur in 30% of pregnancies (7/23) by the end of the second trimester.

TI HUMAN-MILK CONTAINS THE SHIGA TOXIN AND SHIGA-LIKE TOXIN RECEPTOR
   GLYCOLIPID GB3
AB Human milk antibody and nonantibody factors are thought to be important in protecting infants from diarrheal diseases. The nonantibody factors include host receptor analogues that bind to specific pathogen virulence factors, thereby inhibiting these bacterial products from binding to their intestinal target receptors. Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), a glycolipid known to bind to both Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxins, was found to occur in human milk with an average concentration of 73 nM (77 mug/L) for Gb3 containing hydroxylated fatty acids and 50 nM (53 mug/L) for Gb3 containing nonhydroxylated fatty acids. This human milk Gb3 was found to bind to Shiga toxin, consistent with the hypothesis that Gb3 could contribute to the protective effect of human milk against infantile diarrheas associated with Shiga or Shiga-like toxins.

TI INTRAFAMILIAL TRANSMISSION OF HEPATITIS-C VIRUS - THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF
   INFECTIONS BETWEEN SPOUSES
AB To investigate the intrafamilial transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and related risk factors, anti-HCV antibodies in 186 family members of 48 index patients were studied. The index patients were anti-HCV-positive and had chronic liver disease. Overall, 10 family members (5.4%) were positive for anti-HCV, indicating a higher prevalence of anti-HCV among family members than among the Taiwanese general population. Spouses had the highest prevalence (21%) of anti-HCV, with older age and longer duration of marriage of index patients the most evident risk factors. HCV RNA, recovered from the infected couples by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction and subsequently sequenced directly, was identical at the nucleotide level in 3 of the 4 couples studied, and the remaining couple had a homology of > 96%. These results strongly support that interspousal transmission may be the most important route of intrafamilial spreading of HCV, and thus sexual transmission, although with low efficiency, should be considered important in HCV infection.

TI ELK AS A POTENTIAL HOST FOR MENINGEAL WORM - IMPLICATIONS FOR
   TRANSLOCATION
AB Translocation of wild ungulates is a common wildlife management tool and an integral component of game farming activities throughout the world, Elk (Cervus elaphus) are a primary species being moved, and the possibility of translocating a hazardous parasite led us to examine the potential for elk to survive infections of meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis), to shed larvae in feces, and thus, to translocate the parasite. Twenty-six elk calves were exposed to 15-300 infective larvae of meningeal worm. All 13 elk exposed to greater-than-or-equal-to 125 larvae developed neurologic disease and died; 2 shed larvae in feces prior to death. At necropsy, numerous adult meningeal worms were found throughout the central nervous system of each elk. Meningeal worm established infections in all 8 elk exposed to 25 or 75 larvae: 6 calves developed neurological signs (4 recovered, 2 died), the remaining 2 elk did not exhibit any clinical signs. Seven elk given 25 or 75 larvae shed larvae in feces. None of 5 elk exposed to 15 larvae developed clinical neurological signs or shed larvae; meningeal worms were recovered from the central nervous system of only 2. The ability to survive exposure to small numbers of meningeal worms may explain the persistence of the few remnant populations of elk in eastern North America. The potential for larvae to be present in the feces of these animals (or captive elk in the same areas) leads us to recommend that elk not be translocated from eastern to western North America until a reliable diagnostic test or treatment for meningeal worm is available.

TI Use of a novel plasmid to monitor the fate of a genetically engineered
   Pseudomonas putida strain
AB Plasmid pSI30 was constructed to increase the sensitivity of detection of a genetically engineered micro-organism (GEM) and its recombinant DNA in environmental samples. This broad host-range, mobilizable plasmid contained chlorocatechol WO degradative genes, antibiotic resistance genes (ampicillin and kanamycin) and a fragment of eukaryotic DNA. The clc genes encode enzymes that convert 3-chlorocatechol to maleylacetic acid permitting the host, Pseudomonas putida RC-4, to grow on 3-chlorobenzoate. This catabolic phenotype was exploited using enrichment procedures to detect RC-4(pSI30) cells, free-living in the water column or when irreversibly bound to surfaces. The eukaryotic DNA sequence provided a unique target allowing positive identification by DNA:DNA hybridization. Using the eukaryotic DNA sequence as a probe, no transfer of the plasmid to indigenous bacteria was detected. Persistence of RC-4(pSI30) and its ability to multiply upon addition of 3-chlorobenzoate were demonstrated 78 days after its addition to natural freshwater. In flow-through microcosms RC-4(pSI30), undetectable as free-living cells, was found by enrichment as irreversibly bound sessile forms. These experiments revealed the stability of pSI30 and its utility in a 'combination' detection system for tracking the survival of a GEM and its DNA in environmental samples.

AB We have investigated seroreactivity against Plasmodium falciparum crude parasite antigens, the P.falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (Pfl55/RESA), as well as against two synthetic peptides (EENV)6 and (EENVEHDA)3 that represent important epitopes of Pfl55/RESA. The study population consisted of 421 children and adult Thais living in an area with moderate malaria transmission. We related these serologic findings to some important epidemiologic baseline data collected in the study area. The parasite rate in study subjects was 18.76%. Sixty-two percent were seropositive to crude P. falciparum antigens, 30.3% to the Pfl55/RESA antigen, 23.05% to (EENV)6, and 20.17% to (EENVEHDA)3. Antibody responses to crude P. falciparum antigens and to Pfl55/RESA were age dependent and increased with exposure. There was evidence that Pfl55/RESA antibodies might play a role in protective immunity in this population. Since Pfl55/RESA is a potential vaccine candidate antigen, the information obtained from these field studies will provide some seroepidemiologic baseline data for subsequent vaccine trials.

   (BUNYAVIRIDAE, PHLEBOVIRUS) IN ITS NATURAL SAND FLY VECTOR
   PHLEBOTOMUS-PERNICIOSUS
AB A series of experiments were done to study the effect of simulated summer and winter temperatures on the development of Phlebotomus perniciosus (Diptera:Psychodidae) and on the survival of Toscana virus in transovarially infected insects. Sand flies maintained at 28-degrees-C developed relatively fast, with adults emerging from 40 to 55 days after initial oviposition. Similar results were obtained with insects reared at 25-degrees-C. In contrast, sand flies maintained at 15-degrees-C developed slowly up to the fourth larval instar; at that point, further development ceased and the insects entered diapause. Diapause could be terminated by increasing the ambient temperature to 25-degrees-C. The ambient temperatures at which the immature forms were reared (15-degrees-C, 25-degrees-C, and 28-degrees-C) had no effect on the subsequent F, adult filial infection rates with Toscana virus (49.1%, 47.5%, and 46.5%, respectively). The results of these experiments provide a model of how Toscana virus survives the winter in endemic areas by maintenance in diapausing P. perniciosus larvae. In another experiment, venereal transmission of Toscana virus was shown from transovarially infected males to non-infected virgin females. This is the first demonstration of sexual transmission of a phlebovirus by sand flies. If venereal transmission occurs in nature, it would provide an alternative method of virus amplification in the vector population, in the absence of viremic vertebrates.

TI FORAGING ON PREY THAT ARE MODIFIED BY PARASITES
AB A model that weighs the energetic cost of parasitism for a predator against the energetic value of prey items that transmit the parasite to the predator suggests that there is often no selective pressure to avoid parasitized prey. This offers an explanation for why parasites so frequently exploit predators and prey as definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. Furthermore, predators may actually benefit from their parasites if energetic costs of parasitism are moderate and prey capture is facilitated by parasites. Parasite species that benefit predators through modification of prey are not mutuatistic, however.

TI WOLBACHIA ENDOSYMBIONTS RESPONSIBLE FOR VARIOUS ALTERATIONS OF SEXUALITY
   IN ARTHROPODS
AB Rickettsia-like maternally inherited bacteria have been shown to be involved in a variety of alterations of arthropod sexuality, such as female-biased sex ratios, parthenogenesis, and sterility of crosses either between infected males and uninfected females or between infected individuals (cytoplasmic incompatibility). We have characterized several of these microorganisms through partial sequences of the small (16S) and large (23S) subunit ribosomal DNA. All the symbionts identified, which include several cytoplasmic incompatibility microorganisms, several endosymbionts of terrestrial isopods, and symbionts of two thelytokous Trichogramma wasp species, belong to a monophyletic group of related symbionts, some of which have previously been detected in several insects exhibiting cytoplasmic incompatibility. Three molecular lineages can be identified on the basis of 16S as well as 23S sequences. Although they are only known as endocellular symbionts, Wolbachia spread by horizontal transfer across host lineages as evidenced by their diversification which occurred long after that of their hosts, and by the non-congruence of the phylogenetic relationships of symbionts and their hosts. Indeed, symbionts of two different lineages have been found in the same host species, whereas closely related endosymbionts are found in distinct insect orders. Isopod endosymbionts form a separate lineage, and they can determine feminization as well as cytoplasmic incompatibility. The ability to determine cytoplasmic incompatibility, found in all lineages, is probably ancestral to this group.

TI A MODEL OF THE TRANSMISSION OF DENGUE FEVER WITH AN EVALUATION OF THE
   IMPACT OF ULTRA-LOW VOLUME (ULV) INSECTICIDE APPLICATIONS ON DENGUE
   EPIDEMICS
AB We have developed a deterministic susceptible, exposed, infectious, resistant or removed (SEIR) model of dengue fever transmission that enables us to explore the behavior of an epidemic, and to experiment with vector control practices. Populations of both host and vector are divided into compartments representing disease status (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and, for humans, resistant), and the flow between compartments is described by differential equations. Examination of the equilibrium points leads to a formulation of the basic reproduction rate (z0) of the disease. With a base set of parameters, z0 = 1.9 and the model realistically reproduces epidemic transmission in an immunologically naive population. Control of adult mosquitoes by ultra-low volume (ULV) aerosols is simulated by an abrupt decrease in vector densities, followed by gradual recovery of the vector population. The model indicates that ULV has little impact on disease incidence, even when multiple applications are made, although the peak of the epidemic may be delayed. Decreasing the carrying capacity of the environment for mosquitoes. and thus the basic reproduction rate of the disease, by source reduction or other means, is more effective in reducing transmission.

   ARGENTINE HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER
AB We monitored Junin virus (JV) activity in rodent populations for 30 months at seven mark-recapture grids located in agricultural fields and adjacent roadsides and fence lines in endemic and nonendemic areas of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Blood and oral swabs taken from rodents captured at five-week intervals were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for JV antigen (Ag). Calomys laucha and C. musculinus were the most frequently captured rodents, making up 47% and 22% of captures, respectively. Of 41 Ag-positive captures, 37 were C. musculinus and four were C. laucha; 34 were from two trapping grids in the same locality. Antigen-positive Calomys were more frequently male (76%), and were found significantly more frequently among the oldest animals and the largest body mass classes. These patterns, combined with the greater mobility and higher frequencies of wounds among males than females, implicated horizontal transmission as the primary route of JV transmission between rodents. Seasonal maximum levels in JV prevalence (up to 25% of captured Ag-positive C musculinus) occurred during periods of maximal population densities of Calomys. Spatial distribution of Ag-positive rodents reflected habitat preferences; most Ag-positive C musculinus were captured from border habitats (roadsides and fence lines), and all Ag-positive C. laucha were captured in crop fields. These distinct, but previously undocumented, habitat preferences suggest that the disease in humans may be related to exposures to the primary reservoir species, C musculinus, in border habitats rather than in crop fields.

TI REGULATION OF COMPLEMENT ACTIVITY BY VACCINIA VIRUS COMPLEMENT-CONTROL
   PROTEIN
AB A major protein secreted by vaccinia virus-infected cells has structural similarity to the super-family of complement-control proteins. This vaccinia complement-control protein (VCP) was studied to determine how it regulates complement activation. VCP was bound by C4b and C3b and served as a cofactor with factor I in cleaving these two molecules.  VCP inhibited the formation and accelerated the decay of the classical C3 convertase. It also accelerated decay of the alternative pathway convertase. although higher concentrations were apparently needed. In vitro, therefore, VCP interfered with the classical and alternative complement pathways at several steps. In vivo, this interference may increase the virulence of vaccinia virus by enabling it to escape attack by the host's complement system.

TI CHOLERA IN PIURA, PERU - A MODERN URBAN EPIDEMIC
AB In late January 1991, epidemic cholera appeared in Peru. Within 2 months, 7922 cases and 17 deaths occurred in Piura, a Peruvian city of 361,868. A hospital-based culture survey showed that 79%-86% of diarrhea cases were cholera. High vibriocidal antibody titers were detected in 34% of the asymptomatic population. A study of 50 case-patients and 100 matched controls demonstrated that cholera was associated with drinking unboiled water (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-8.9), drinking beverages from street vendors (OR, 14.6; CI, 4.2-51.2), and eating food from street vendors (OR. 24.0; CI, 3.0-191). In a second study, patients were more likely than controls to consume beverages with ice (OR. 4.0; CI, 1.1-18.3). Ice was produced from municipal water. Municipal water samples revealed no or insufficient chlorination, and fecal coliform bacteria were detected in samples from 6 of 10 wells tested. With epidemic cholera spreading throughout Latin America. these findings emphasize the importance of safe municipal drinking water.

TI A SUBPOPULATION OF TREPONEMA-PALLIDUM IS RESISTANT TO PHAGOCYTOSIS -
   POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF PERSISTENCE
AB While untreated syphilis infection is characterized by spontaneous resolution of early lesions, a few organisms evade the host immune response and persist for many years. Macrophages are generally recognized as the effector cell responsible for bacterial clearance, and phagocytosis is enhanced by immune serum. This study examined the susceptibility of Treponema pallidum isolated at various stages of lesion resolution to opsonization and phagocytosis by macrophages in vitro. Findings suggest that the population of organisms remaining after the majority of bacteria have been cleared in vivo is resistant to phagocytosis. This may provide a mechanism for the persistence of T. pallidum in the face of an otherwise active immune response.

TI A KIN SELECTION MODEL FOR THE EVOLUTION OF VIRULENCE
AB The costs and benefits of parasite virulence are analysed in an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) model. Increased host mortality caused by disease (virulence) reduces a parasite's fitness by damaging its food supply. The fitness costs of high virulence may be offset by the benefits of increased transmission or ability to withstand the host's defences. It has been suggested that multiple infections lead to higher virulence because of competition among parasite strains within a host. A quantitative prediction is given for the ESS virulence rate as a function of the coefficient of relatedness among co-infecting strains. The prediction depends on the quantitative relation between the costs of virulence and the benefits of transmission or avoidance of host defences. The particular mechanisms by which parasites can increase their transmission or avoid host defences also have a key role in the evolution of virulence when there are multiple infections.

TI A STUDY OF ONCHOCERCIASIS WITH SEVERE SKIN AND EYE LESIONS IN A
   HYPERENDEMIC ZONE IN THE FOREST OF SOUTHWESTERN CAMEROON - CLINICAL,
   PARASITOLOGICAL, AND ENTOMOLOGIC FINDINGS
AB Prior to the initiation of an onchocerciasis control program based on the mass administration of ivermectin in the rain forest of southwestern Cameroon, a preliminary baseline study of the area was conducted. The results of this study showed that onchocerciasis was hyperendemic in the area. Skin symptoms and signs were observed including pruritus (67.4% of the population examined), onchocerca nodules (51.6%), skin depigmentation (18.5%), and hanging groins (5.7%). Except for pruritus, the prevalence of these symptoms increased with age. Of the eyes examined, 44.9% had microfilariae in the anterior chamber, 33.5% had choroidoretinitis, 28.0% had punctate keratitis, 8.3% had papillary abnormalities, and 3.6% had sclerosing keratitis. Vision in 10.5% of the eyes examined was classified as blind or very poor (visual acuity = 0-0.10), in 15.7% as poor (visual acuity = 0.11-0.39), and in 73.8% as good (visual acuity = 0.4-1.00). Unlike previous reports that have linked serious ocular damage mainly to savanna onchocerciasis, the present study showed that forest onchocerciasis also caused significant ocular pathology, including blindness. Parasitologically, positive skin snips were recorded for 92.7% of the persons examined, with both sexes being equally infected. The parasite load, expressed as the geometric mean number of microfilariae per skin snip, was 53.6, and was much higher in males than in females. The fly vector, Simulium squamosum, had a high infection rate of 7.5% infective females in Bakumba and 6.8% infective females in Ngbandi, the two fly-catching points. The transmission potential was 266 infective larvae per person per month in Bakumba and 189 in Ngbandi.

TI LOCAL ADAPTATION OF THE TREMADOTE DIPLOSTOMUM-PHOXINI TO THE EUROPEAN
   MINNOW PHOXINUS-PHOXINUS, ITS 2ND INTERMEDIATE HOST
AB 1. In this paper we stress the important role that immature parasites can play in the interaction with their hosts and the importance of looking at juvenile hosts when studying parasite effects. These results are discussed in relation to the evolution of host-parasite associations and to Hamilton & Zuk's (1982) hypothesis on the evolution of secondary sexual characters.
   2. We exposed juvenile European minnows Phoxinus phoxinus from two lake populations to sympatric and allopatric Diplostomum phoxini in a reciprocal cross-infection experiment.
   3. Parasites from both localities were more infective to the sympatric hosts than to the allopatric ones.
   4. During the first 4 weeks after infection, when the parasites grow within the host, minnows from both sympatric host-parasite combinations grew less quickly than minnows infected with allopatric parasites.
   5. The parasites did not affect the host mortality.
   6. The results suggest that: (a) there is a genetic basis to the host-parasite interaction; (b) the parasite is adapted to its local host genotype; (c) the parasite influences energy allocation and so may reduce host fitness, at least while it grows within the host.

TI USING SIMPLE-MODELS TO PREDICT VIRUS EPIZOOTICS IN GYPSY-MOTH
   POPULATIONS
AB 1. Biologists have made little use of recent advances in the mathematical theory of the dynamics of insect pathogens, because of difficulties with parameter estimation and misgivings about the simplicity of the models in question.
   2. We use an existing simple model for the dynamics of insect pathogens, slightly modified both to provide greater accuracy and to allow for more straightforward parameter estimation.
   3. Focusing on the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L.)), we estimated each of the model parameters independently, estimating three of the four model parameters from the literature.
   4. To estimate the rate of transmission, we present an experimental protocol which involves fitting a reduced version of the model to data from a small-scale transmission experiment.
   5. Without circularity or curve-fitting, we tested the model with literature data giving initial densities and weekly NPV mortality for epizootics in eight gypsy moth populations on 4-9 ha plots in Massachusetts, USA.
   6. The model predictions are reasonably accurate for five of the eight populations, suggesting that gypsy moth NPV dynamics within a season are driven by a small number of biological processes.
   7. The three populations for which the model did poorly began the season with low host densities yet gave rise to more severe epizootics than predicted by the model. This indicates that standard assumptions about disease transmission may not hold for gypsy moth NPV dynamics at low densities; specifically, we suspect that density-related changes in larval behaviour result in higher NPV transmission at low density.
   8. These results suggest that simple models of the dynamics of animal pathogens can be used to make quantitative predictions about disease dynamics in the field.

TI THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARASITE BURDEN AND HOST RESOURCES IN THE
   DESERT TOAD (SCAPHIOPUS-COUCHII), UNDER NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS
AB 1. The desert toad, Scaphiopus couchii, survives 10 months hibernation (during which it does not feed) by utilizing stored lipid reserves predominantly concentrated in coelomic fat bodies. The majority of toads emerging from hibernation have negligible fat bodies, although 4% of uninfected males have enough reserves to survive a further year.
   2. Adults of the monogenean parasite, Pseudodiplorchis americanus, infect breeding toads (with a 50% prevalence) and feed upon host blood. In one area of desert in southeastern Arizona, USA, infected male and female toads emerging from hibernation had significantly smaller fat bodies than those uninfected. Infected females also had a lower packed cell volume (PCV) of the blood. Fat body weight of both sexes and PCV of females declined significantly with increasing parasite burden.
   3. Fat body weights increased during the period of foraging and there was no measurable effect of adult parasite infection after 2 week's feeding. Therefore, the difference observed in freshly-emerged toads probably reflects the actual parasite drain on host fat reserves during hibernation: representing around 7% of the toads' annual lipid requirement.
   4. Ovary weight also increased during foraging, but it was not possible to determine if reproductive investment was lower in infected animals. Paradoxically, testes weight was smaller in male toads without adult parasites. However, first-time breeders are invariably uninfected. Parasite effects on host reproductive success cannot be determined without considering age-related infection levels in conjunction with age-related reproductive output.
   5. Field samples were biased towards animals in breeding condition and these inevitably have suffered least. Extrapolation of the effects of adult P. americanus upon host condition suggests that some toads would not breed or might not survive hibernation due to parasite infection. This relationship identifies the potential for parasites to regulate natural host populations.

AB 1. Simple models were developed to explore the interaction between the lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) pest Sitona discoideus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and its introduced braconid parasite Microctonus aethiopoides Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in New Zealand.
   2. A model for the population dynamics of S. discoideus demonstrated that observed levels of parasitism account for a decline in pest abundance, in spite of strong density-dependent mortality in the host.
   3. An empirical model for changes in parasitism from year to year, spanning five to six parasitoid generations each year, suggested that control is likely to be maintained in the long term and that the interaction is stable.
   4. Tentative values were established for the average searching efficiency of M. aethiopoides (approximately 0.25 m2  per parasitoid per generation) and for parameters governing pseudo-interference and a functional response to host density, based on analysis of discrete parasitoid generations.
   5. Based on experimental data and field temperatures, a simulation model of daily parasitoid behaviour over summer, when generations overlap, supported the hypothesis that atypically developing parasitoids are those oviposited in newly emerged adult weevils. The model accounted for the observed atypical summer build-up of parasitism which is essential for the success of biological control.
   6. The models suggested that biological control of S. discoideus is complementary to other forms of control, including other biological control agents, because subsequent levels of parasitism appear little affected by changes in pest density.
   7. It is argued that quantitative analysis of specific biological control case studies, both successful and unsuccessful, is a vital prerequisite for improvements in general biocontrol theory and practice.

TI FACTORS AFFECTING BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL OF CASSAVA MEALYBUG BY
   EXOTICPARASITOIDS - A RATIO-DEPENDENT SUPPLY-DEMAND DRIVEN MODEL
AB 1. A unified ratio-dependent supply-demand driven tritrophic model of the cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) system was compared to field data, and then used to explore the basis for the successful control of cassava mealybug (CM, Phenacoccus manihoti Mat.-Ferr.) in Africa by the exotic parasitoid Epidinocarsis lopezi (DeSantis). The causes for the failure of the related parasitoid E. diversicornis (Howard) to establish were examined. 2. Among the important findings are: (i) the functional and numerical responses of either parasitoid alone are insufficient to explain the observed dynamics of the mealybug; (ii) rainfall and its enhancement of the fungal pathogen Neozyites fumosa suppress CM numbers sufficiently during the wet season so that the parasitoid E. lopezi, with its efficient search, can regulate CM density at low levels during the dry season; (iii) weather and soil factors (e.g. nitrogen and water) affect plant growth rates directly, and CM size and number dynamics and parasitoid sex ratios indirectly; (iv) the effects of host-size dynamics on sex ratios favour E. lopezi over E. diversicornis; (v) the importance of low rates of parasitoid immigration for the successful regulation of CM is demonstrated; (vi) the higher host-finding capacity of E. lopezi enhances its dominance over E. diversicornis; but (vii) the sway of E. lopezi in cases of multiple parasitism causes the competitive displacement of E. diversicornis from the system during periods when few hosts are available and/or when weather-induced plant stress decreases host size, favouring a stronger male-biased sex ratio in E. diversicornis than in E. lopezi. 3. This modelling paradigm allows the richness of the observed biology to be incorporated with relative ease.

TI PREVALENCE OF SERUM ANTIBODIES TO HUMAN T-LYMPHOTROPIC VIRUS-1 IN AN
   ISOLATED TRIBE IN THE HIGHLANDS OF IRIAN-JAYA, INDONESIA
AB There have been several recent reports on the high prevalence of serum antibodies to human T lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) in isolated populations residing in the coastal areas and highlands of Papua New Guinea. In the absence of significant cases of clinical disease, it has been surmised that this reactivity might be the consequence of serologic recognition of yet undefined human retroviruses or parasite antigens. These observations prompted an investigation of the prevalence of anti-HTLV-1 antibodies among members of the Ngalum tribe that dwells in a secluded highland valley in the eastern Jayawijaya Mountains of Irian Jaya, Indonesian New Guinea. Of 165 tribespeople, 85 (52%) were positive for IgG antibodies to HTLV-1 in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Eighty-two were more than 10 years of age. On the Western blot, all positive sera reacted strongly with the p19 core antigen, but recognition of the envelope antigens, gp46 and gp21, was conspicuously absent. Thirty-four of the 8 5 villagers with these indeterminant blots had active Plasmodium falciparum infections, but antibody absorption studies with HTLV-1 and P. falciparum erythrocytic stage antigens failed to confirm suspected serologic cross-reactivities. Thirty-three others had acute malaria and/or high titers of anti-malaria antibodies but were seronegative for HTLV-1. We suspect that indeterminant Western blots for HTLV-1 reflect antibody responses to related latent retroviruses that are activated as a consequence of immunosuppression following malaria infection and chloroquine therapy.

TI SHOULD YELLOW-FEVER VACCINE BE INCLUDED IN THE EXPANDED PROGRAM OF
   IMMUNIZATION IN AFRICA - A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS FOR NIGERIA
AB The cost-effectiveness of preventive yellow fever vaccination versus emergency mass vaccination campaigns for epidemic control remains a matter of controversy. Until recently, Nigeria and other anglophone countries in West Africa most severely afflicted by yellow fever epidemics have followed a policy of emergency control. The effects of including yellow fever 17D vaccine in the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) on the immune status of the Nigerian population was studied under conservative assumptions of vaccine coverage and efficacy. The model defined the age-specific prevalence of immunity resulting from vaccination of infants and from natural endemic infection beginning in 1991 and extending over a time horizon of 35 years. The data were used to predict the number of cases and deaths during hypothetical epidemics in 2006 and 2026, representing the historic periodicity of epidemics. A second model was used to demonstrate that a greater-than-or-equal-to 60% prevalence of immunity would preclude epidemic yellow fever transmission; under base case assumptions, this prevalence would be reached after 18 years of initiating routine yellow fever vaccination in the Guinea savannah zone, the region most often affected by epidemics. Using assumptions based on data from other African countries, the cost of adding yellow fever vaccine to the existing EPI was estimated as $0.65 per fully immunized child, whereas the cost of emergency vaccination in the face of an epidemic was estimated as $7.84/person. Vaccine coverage rates achievable by the EPI were modeled on recent successes with measles vaccine, and began in 1991 at 60%. The effective vaccine coverage rate in an emergency campaign was taken as 10%, based on recent experience. For an epidemic of moderate size in 2006 (morbidity similar to the documented outbreak in 1987), the cost-effectiveness of emergency mass immunization for control of hypothetical yellow fever epidemics was two-fold higher ($381/case and $1,904/death prevented) than that of the EPI ($763/case and $3,817/death prevented). However, despite its higher cost, the efficiency of the EPI was seven-fold greater in terms of cases and deaths prevented. In large epidemics, such as that occurring over successive years (1986-1991) in Nigeria, cost-effectiveness of the EPI exceeded that of emergency control. The EPI may also play an important role in the prevention of endemic yellow fever. Assuming annual rates of endemic yellow fever predicted by serologic surveys, routine vaccination would significantly reduce morbidity and mortality at cost-effectiveness ratios within the range for other diseases prevented by the EPI, including polio, tetanus, and diphtheria. This analysis supports the recent decision to invest in yellow fever vaccine as part of the EPI.

TI PATTERNS OF RUST INFECTION AS A FUNCTION OF HOST GENETIC DIVERSITY AND
   HOST DENSITY IN NATURAL-POPULATIONS OF THE APOMICTIC CRUCIFER,
   ARABIS-HOLBOELLII
AB It is often assumed that genetic diversity contributes to reduced disease incidence in natural plant populations. However, little is known about the genetic structure of natural populations affected by disease. Here I present data from three apomictic (asexual) populations of Arabis holboellii infected by the rusts Puccinia monoica and P. thlaspeos. An average of 300 host individuals per population were genotyped (using seven variable allozyme loci) and scored for disease presence. Arabis holboellii populations are genetically diverse; the number of clones detected per population ranged from 6 to 27. There was substantial variation in frequency of host clones within and among sites, and significant variation among clones in susceptibility to the different rusts. Contrary to predictions based on frequency-dependent selection theory there was not a consistent positive relationship between clone frequency and disease incidence within any of the populations (Spearman's r = -0.096, P > 0.5). In addition, clonally diverse populations did not necessarily have decreased disease incidence. The population with the lowest overall (both pathogens combined) disease incidence (7.5 +/- 1.9%) had the smallest number of clones (6), the lowest spatial variability, and the highest Arabis density. By comparison, another population had 22 clones, high spatial variability, low Arabis density and significantly more disease overall (16.8 +/- 2.7%). Although this study does not eliminate the possibility of frequency-dependent pathogen attack in these populations, the results suggest that it is likely to be weak or intermittent.

AB The epidemiology of B virus infection in a large (n = 157) cohort of rhesus macaques at the California Regional Primate Research Center was evaluated prospectively from September 1989 through January 1991 by serial physical examinations, a behavioral substudy (n = 51), and repeated diagnostic testing. Half were B virus antibody-positive at baseline; subsequently, incident cases of infection were documented through serology alone (42) or with virus isolation (5). Eight recurrent infections and a single symptomatic (primary) case were observed. Risk of B virus infection increased as monkeys aged, with few >3 years old remaining uninfected. Postpubertal monkeys and those entering sexual adolescence (2-3 years) were at greatest risk, although wounding by cagemates and breeding history (for females) were both significant predictors of time to infection. B virus was isolated from oral or conjunctival and genital tissues in equal proportions. Transmission occurred only during the breeding season, possibly coinciding with an elevation in social stressors in the population.

TI COVERT IRIDOVIRUS INFECTION OF BLACKFLY LARVAE
AB Iridovirus infections are typically isolated at extremely low frequencies from invertebrate species in moist or aquatic habitats. Crystalline arrangements of virus particles in heavily infected tissues cause an iridescent hue obvious to the naked eye; diagnosis of iridovirus infection has traditionally occurred when the host appeared bright lilac or blue. Evidence is presented here to show that there are two forms of iridovirus infection in larval blackfly (Diptera: Simuliidae) populations: (i) the classical patent form which causes larvae to develop blue iridescence before death; and (ii) a covert (inapparent) form which is not lethal. Patent infections are extremely rare in Simulium populations from the River Ystwyth, Wales (ca. 1 in 10(6)). However, a large proportion of the population harbours the disease without obvious symptoms. Covert iridovirus infection was shown by using two techniques. First, tissue homogenates from 8 out of 30 apparently healthy Simulium larvae produced patent iridovirus infections when injected into a permissive lepidopteran host species. The DNA restriction profiles from these covert isolates showed very close similarities in fragment pattern and variability to isolates causing patent infections in the same River Ystwyth populations. Second, the presence of iridovirus DNA in host tissues was confirmed by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeted at the iridovirus major structural protein gene. The frequency of PCR-positive larvae taken from the River Ystwyth in April 1992 varied between 17% and 37%, depending on site.

AB A 13-month study of wild mice (Mus domesticus) in wheatlands in southeastern Australia contrasted changes in the seroprevalence of antibody to 13 viruses and the occurrence of helminths with changes in their population dynamics. Mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), rotavirus, minute virus of mice (MVM), mouse adenovirus (MAdV), reovirus (reo 3), and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). The seroprevalences of all but rotavirus varied significantly with time and increased with host density. Near the end of the study, host density declined rapidly and the seroprevalence of MVM and reo 3 increased significantly. These two viruses had low seroprevalence when host survival was high and high seroprevalence when host survival was low, indicating they may play a role in regulating mouse populations. In the case of MVM, there was evidence of a viral epizootic during the decline in mouse abundance. The prevalence of four helminths (Taenia taeniaeformis, Syphacia obvelata, and Vampirolepis spp.) differed significantly with time but showed no apparent association with host density. These findings highlight the need for further study on the effect of viruses on the population dynamics of mice.

Ten cases occurred among a population of 40,000. The prevalence of antibody to JE virus among 234 lifelong Saipan residents surveyed after the outbreak was 4.2%. Age, household crowding, and lack of air conditioning were risk factors for infection. The seroprevalence in pigs, which are important amplifying hosts of JE virus, was 96% (n = 52). None of 288 stored serum specimens from lifelong Saipan residents sampled in 1984 were seropositive. These data suggest that JE virus was recently introduced onto Saipan and that peridomestic factors affected the risk of human infection. Transmission of JE virus probably ended with exhaustion of the supply of susceptible amplifying hosts. Surveillance for human cases and seroconversions in pigs during 1991 revealed no evidence of ongoing JE virus transmission.

TI COMMUNITY-BASED PREVALENCE PROFILE OF ARBOVIRAL, RICKETTSIAL, AND
   HANTAAN-LIKE VIRAL ANTIBODY IN THE NILE RIVER DELTA OF EGYPT
AB To determine the current prevalence of antibody to arboviruses, rickettsiae, and hantaan-like viruses, a survey was carried out in the Nile River Valley of Egypt, one of the principal foci of the 1977-1978 Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak. Blood specimens were obtained from 915 persons representing 190 study households. Enzyme immunoassay testing showed that the overall prevalence of IgG antibody was 4% to sand fly fever Sicilian (SFS), 2% to sandfly fever Naples (SFN), 15% to RVF, 20% to West Nile, and 4% to Hantaan (HTN) viruses. Antibody was demonstrated among 32% of the same study subjects to Coxiella burnetii, 58% to Rickettsia typhi, and 32% to R. conorii. The prevalence of agent-specific antibody tended to increase with age. Particularly notable was the low prevalence of RVF infection in children born after the height of the RVF outbreak. No detectable antibodies were found in the population less than seven years of age and in only 3% of those 7-12 years old. In contrast, 26% of the study population 13-19 years old, who were young children and infants at the time of the outbreak, were found to have RVF antibodies, suggesting that the level of intensity associated with transmission decreased considerably following the documented 1977-1978 outbreak. Geometric mean titers (GMT) ranged from 139 for C burnetii to 1,305 for RVF, and did not vary significantly by age, except for high titers for RVF in the 20-49-year-old age group. A significant upward trend in GMT was also noted when antibody was detected in the specimen for more than one phlebovirus. This was observed for SFS, SFN, and RVF, i.e., 1,172 for RVF only, 1,334 for RVF and SFN, 1,828 for RVF with SFS, and 2,1 11 for RVF with SFN and SFS (P < 0.05). These figures attest to the boosting phenomenon found when antibody for one phlebovirus is found in association with others. These findings show prevalences of rickettsial antibodies and warrant further study of disease incidence associated with acquired infection. Additionally, familial clustering of infected cases in households was evident only for C burnetii, R. typhi, and R. conorii, and was independent of sex.

   MURINE CYTOMEGALOVIRUS DNA-INJECTED EGGS TO SURROGATE MOTHERS
AB To study the potential consequences of sperm-mediated sexual cytomegalovirus (CMV) transmission, an in vitro model of microinjection of murine CMV (MCMV) DNA into uninfected fertilized murine ova was used. After microinjected ova were cultured to blastocysts and transferred to pseudopregnant mice, the effect of the DNA on implantation and development was analyzed. At various times, the sites of implantation in the endometrium were examined. Reductions in litter size, fetal growth retardation, resorption of embryos, and fetal maldevelopment, which often involved the central nervous system, were observed. The presence of MCMV DNA sequences in DNA derived from fetuses was detected by the polymerase chain reaction followed by oligonucleotide hybridization. By in situ DNA-DNA cytohybridization and indirect immunofluorescence assays the viral sequences and antigens were localized primarily to the brain, salivary gland, and skin of maldeveloped fetuses. These results establish the potential consequences of sperm-mediated CMV transmission and induction of fetal anomalies.

TI AVIAN HOSTS OF ST-LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS-VIRUS IN PINE-BLUFF, ARKANSAS, 1991
AB An investigation of the extent of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus activity in the avian population in Pine Bluff, Arkansas was conducted from August 30, 1991 through September 5, 199 1, following an SLE epidemic that resulted in 25 human cases. A total of 363 birds of 33 species were captured with ground-level mist nets at four sites along the northern edge of the city. No viruses were isolated from the serum of these birds, but 91 birds (25%) of 11 species had detectable neutralizing antibody against the TBH-28 strain of SLE virus in the constant-virus, serum-dilution, plaque-reduction neutralization test in Vero cell culture. No antibody to eastern equine encephalitis virus was detected. The prevalence of antibody to SLE virus varied among the sites from 11% to 44%, but the prevalence at each site was influenced by the avian species composition. The two most abundant species captured in the city, the American robin (43%) and house sparrow (42%), also had the highest prevalence of antibody. Nine other bird species were serologically positive but at significantly lower rates than for the abundant species. The antibody prevalence was higher in immature birds (27%) than in adult birds (15%), but the antibody titers were higher in adult birds than in immature ones. The overall SLE antibody prevalence and the prevalence for house sparrows were significantly higher than the average prevalence for avian hosts studied during previous SLE epidemics. Therefore, house sparrows would be a good choice for a local sentinel species.

TI PHAGOCYTIC FUNCTION OF MONOCYTE-DERIVED MACROPHAGES IS NOT AFFECTED BY
   HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1 INFECTION
AB The immunopathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by the failure to control opportunistic infections. Here, the direct effect of HIV on macrophage phagocytic function was studied. HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived macrophages expressed as many Fcgamma and complement receptors as did control macrophages. The function of these receptors was not affected by HIV-1 infection since binding and internalization of opsonized Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were not impaired. Production of reactive oxygen species induced by stimulation of the HIV-1-infected macrophages with opsonized E. coli, zymosan, or PMA was intact. HIV-1-infected macrophages killed opsonized E. coli and Candida albicans as effectively as did control macrophages. These results, therefore, do not support the hypothesis that HIV-1 infection of macrophages causes phagocytic dysfunction and suggest that HIV-induced abnormalities outside the mononuclear phagocyte system may lead to the inability to control opportunistic pathogens.

In total, 2159 blood specimens were obtained from 945 seronegative IVDUs; of these, 182 had 1 specimen, 339 had 2, 397 had 3, and 27 had 4 semiannual specimens. No proviral DNA was detected in 2134 (98.8%) of the samples. Specimens from 7 persons (0.3%) were reactive by PCR. Within 6 months, all 5 of these 7 who returned for follow-up visits had seroconverted. Serum from 19 persons (0.9%) were equivocal by PCR analysis, that is, single primer pair amplification; 1 person seroconverted while others subsequently remained seronegative and nonreactive by PCR. The concordance between PCR and serology was 98.6%. It is concluded that immunosilent HIV-1 infection is uncommon and that serologic screening for HIV-1 antibodies is highly sensitive in this population.

TI COEVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF SEX IN A METAPOPULATION - ESCAPING THE RED
   QUEEN
AB The Red Queen hypothesis for the maintenance of sexual reproduction suggests that harmful parasites and pathogens exert selection pressures on their hosts which make asexual reproduction an unstable long-term strategy. We propose, however, that host obligate asexuality can be favoured in the long term, despite the effects of parasites, under the following conditions. First, the host population structure should approximate a metapopulation. Second, the hosts or the parasites should exhibit relatively high levels of dispersal. Third, parasites must disperse independently of their hosts. In support of this view, we present a computer simulation of host-parasite coevolution in a metapopulation. The simulation demonstrates that a large difference between host and parasite dispersal rates favours an obligately asexual host reproductive strategy over an obligately sexual one. This hypothesis may explain the persistence of anciently asexual taxa, such as the bdelloid rotifers, and the patterns of dispersal seen in obligately asexual groups in general.

TI TRANSFER OF A PARASITIC SEX FACTOR TO THE NUCLEAR GENOME OF THE HOST - A
   HYPOTHESIS ON THE EVOLUTION OF SEX-DETERMINING MECHANISMS IN THE
   TERRESTRIAL ISOPOD ARMADILLIDIUM-VULGARE LATR
AB In A. vulgare sex is usually determined either by a cytoplasmic feminizing factor (F symbiotic bacteria) or by another feminizing factor (f) which behaves like a mobile element of DNA and which seems to correspond to a fragment of bacterial DNA. By inhibiting the expression of male genes carried by the Z heterochromosome, these feminizing factors induce differentiation of neo-females [ZZ(+F) or ZZ(+f)]. Such a mechanism leads to the production of progenies whose sex ratio is highly female biased. In some populations in which F and/or f factors are present, genetic females (WZ) have disappeared and all individuals (males and females) are genetic males. However in other populations, cohabitation of ZZ(+f) neo-females and females in all points similar to genetic females is observed. Such a situation may be unstable and is not likely to be explainable only by migrations of individuals from distinct populations.
   Owing to certain types of crosses, in particular those which involve an artificial neo-male (= female reversed into a functional male by an implant of androgenic gland) we show here that the f factor can be transmitted as a Mendelian gene.  In these progenies Z(f)Z females may appear: like WZ females, they breed broods whose sex ratio is unbiased. The hypothesis that the ''F bacteria A. vulgare'' symbiosis may have led, after a complex co-evolutive process (F bacteria --> f mobile element --> insertion of f on Z heterochromosome), to the creation (from a male genotype) of a female genotype, is put forward. The consequences of such a phenomenon on the composition and the evolution of A. vulgare populations are examined.

   DIVERSE NEWBORN POPULATIONS, 1980-1990
AB Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading cause of congenital viral infection in the United States. To prevent damaging congenital CMV infections, it is necessary to have accurate population estimates of prevalence and to identify maternal factors associated with an elevated risk of congenital infection in the newborn. From 1980 through 1990, 17,163 offspring of predominately low-income nonwhite women who delivered at a public hospital and 9892 newborns of predominately mid- to upper-income white women who delivered at a private hospital were screened for congenital CMV infection. Women <20 years old (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [POR], 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-8.9) at the public hospital and all nonwhite women (adjusted POR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2) had an increased risk of delivering an infected newborn. Newborns of adolescent women in both populations had the highest prevalence of clinically apparent infection. Offspring of nonwhite low-income adolescents are at greatest risk for congenital CMV infection and more damaging sequelae.

AB A recombinant adenovirus (Ad) expressing glycoprotein B (gB) of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (AdgB8) was evaluated as a mucosal vaccine candidate. When administered intranasally (inl) to C57B1/6 mice, AdgB8 induced levels of serum anti-HSV gB IgG antibodies similar to those of mice immunized intraperitoneally (ip), which neutralized both HSV-1 and -2. Mice immunized inl with AdgB8 produced secretory IgA specific for HSV gB, but mice immunized ip did not. Splenic anti-HSV cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were observed after inl and ip immunization; however, there was a time-dependent decrease in the anti-HSV CTL activity from spleens of inl immunized mice. Anti-HSV CTL were also present in the mediastinal lymph nodes after inl but not ip AdgB8 immunization. Furthermore, mice immunized inl with AdgB8 were protected against heterologous inl challenge with HSV-2, and this protection lasted longer than in ip-immunized mice. These results indicate that mucosal immunization with a recombinant adenovirus can induce mucosal and systemic immune responses and provide long-term protection from mucosally or sexually transmitted viruses.

TI TRADE-OFFS WITH RESISTANCE TO A GRANULOSIS-VIRUS IN THE INDIAN MEAL
   MOTH, EXAMINED BY A LABORATORY EVOLUTION EXPERIMENT
AB 1. When microbial agents are used as pest-control agents, resistance in the host may be selected for. If resistance occurs there are potentially fitness costs due to trade-offs between resistance and other life-history traits. Genotypic trade-offs with resistance to a virus in a lepidopteran host are examined by a micro-evolutionary selection experiment.
   2. Six populations of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, were established, three of which supported a granulosis virus infection (selected insects) while the remaining three acted as virus-free controls.
   3. After a period of 2 years, bioassays with the virus showed that selected moths were 1.96-fold more resistant to infection (LD50S) than those derived from the virus-free control populations.
   4. Correlated with this increase in resistance were a lengthening of development time, a reduction in egg viability and an increase in pupal weight.
   5. These changes in life-history traits suggest that a cost in fitness of 15% (sensu Sibly & Calow 1986) is associated with the evolution of the resistance.
   6. The importance of fitness costs associated with the development of resistance to pathogens is discussed.

Clustering analysis revealed two primary phylogenetic divisions at a distance of >0.8, both containing serotype III isolates. One division, comprising virtually all disease isolates, showed a population structure like that of traditional pathogens. The other division, containing the majority of carrier isolates, had a structure reminiscent of that of mucosal commensals, with each isolate being different.

AB Regions of DNA containing promoter sequences from a Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola-specific phage (phi11P) were identified by shotgun cloning into a broad-host-range promoter-probe vector (pQF70). When used in conjunction with the luciferase reporter genes, one of these DNA fragments, 19H, directed gene expression at a level which enabled the subsequent light output (bioluminescence) of single cells of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola to be detected and visualized using a charge-coupled device (CCD). The P. syringae pv. phaseolicola phi11P, 19H and P. aeruginosa phiPLS27, HcM promoters gave a 50-fold increase in bioluminescence (maximum relative light output) compared to similar constructs containing other well-characterized promoters, for example, tetracycline. Similar bioluminescent characteristics of the transformed bacterium, were observed during growth with and without antibiotic-selection. When lux- bacteria were inoculated onto French bean leaf (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the resultant secondary halo blight lesions were bioluminescent and during phylloplane colonization by the lux+ bacterium, bioluminescence on leaf surfaces was detected and imaged by the CCD. Use of these newly identified promoters, combined with the greatly increased sensitivity of bioluminescence detection by the CCD, thus provided a new dimension for the study of natural ecological populations during the bacterial colonization of plants.

TI NONTARGET AND ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF TRANSGENICALLY ALTERED DISEASE
   RESISTANCE IN CROPS - POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON THE MYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSIS
AB The ability to increase crop disease resistance by using transgenic (TG) means has recently been demonstrated for several crops. The current TG procedures alter the temporal expression of transgene pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, so that the usually inducible PR proteins are expressed constitutively in the foreign host. The constitutive expression of the transgene PR protein chitinase is believed to increase the host's nonspecific basic resistance to pathogens. A potential nontarget effect of constitutively expressing chitinase may be a decrease in the activity of beneficial microbes, especially vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The decrease in activity of mycorrhizal fungi is related to reduced susceptibility of TG plant roots to colonization by these fungi, which is in turn associated with lysis of fungal cell walls by the constitutively expressed chitinase. An argument is presented that use of TG means to alter the temporal expression of PR proteins ignores a legacy of past evolutionary trade-offs in vascular plants. A major nontarget effect of expressing transgene chitinase is a reduction in the susceptibility of roots to colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. This reduction in mycorrhizal susceptibility occurs without alteration of the mycorrhizal dependence of the host on symbiont-supplied nutrients. Data are presented in support of this contention that demonstrate a strong negative association between host pathogen resistance and mycorrhizal colonization. An ecological consequence of reducing mycorrhizal colonization is a decrease in the soil's mycorrhizal propagule reserve that diminishes the next crop's production, especially under low-input cropping practices. A further consequence that has both ecological and evolutionary outcomes is the escape of the transgene for improved pathogen resistance into wild populations. By increasing a crop's disease resistance by TG means, we may inadvertently be creating a 'super weed' when the TG plant or the transgene escapes into wild relatives through hybridization. Hybridization of wild relatives with TG plants would be especially relevant for crops, such as sugar beet, rapeseed, and many modem cereal cultivars that have close relatives in the wild but have a relatively low requirement for symbiont supplied nutrients or are nondependent.

TI THE UBIQUITIN-LIGASE SYSTEM IN TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI-BRUCEI
AB The question of whether the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei brucei utilizes a ubiquitin-ligase system to conjugate the 8,500-dalton protein ubiquitin to other proteins has not been investigated. Using I-125-labeled ubiquitin and gel electrophoresis (sodium dodecyl sulfate and acetic acid, urea, Triton X-100), we looked for the incorporation of label into proteins larger than ubiquitin to determine ubiquitin-ligase system activity in cytosolic and nuclear lysates of long slender, intermediate, and short stumpy bloodstream-form trypanosomes. We present data suggesting that there is cytosolic activity of a ubiquitin-ligase system in all three bloodstream forms of T. brucei brucei. There are indications that the three bloodstream forms of T. brucei brucei differ in their cytosolic ubiquitin-ligase system activity. Our assay showed no activity of this system in the nucleus of T. brucei brucei. Further studies on the ubiquitin-ligase system in T. brucei brucei may define differences between the three bloodstream forms, the parasite, and its host, leading to development of novel chemotherapeutic strategies.

TI DIVERSIFICATION OF CARNIVOROUS PARASITIC INSECTS - EXTRAORDINARY
   RADIATION OR SPECIALIZED DEAD-END
AB The spectacular diversity of insects has often been attributed to accelerated radiation of groups acquiring specialized trophic habits. In accord with this hypothesis, a previous study demonstrated consistently greater diversification in clades attacking higher plants, as contrasted to their predaceous or saprophagous sister groups. Faster diversification of phytophagous insects could represent radiation in an unsaturated adaptive zone or result from the population fragmentation and diversifying selection imposed by ecological specialization per se. The latter effect underlies the hypothesis that rapid diversification characterizes ''parasitic'' insects in a broad sense including most phytophages, contrasting with the classical view of parasitic specialization as an evolutionary ''dead end.'' To test these hypotheses, we catalogued the origins and effect on diversification of animal parasitism by insects. Of 15 carnivorous parasitic insect clades with estimated relationships, six were more diverse than their predaceous or saprophagous sister groups, and nine less diverse (Wilcoxon T = 28, P < .10). The parasitic lifestyle in the broad sense is by itself unlikely to be a dominant explanation of variable insect diversification rate, while the hypothesis that parasitism in the strict sense is an evolutionary dead end remains plausible. Carnivorous parasitism and phytophagy have significantly different effects on diversification. We found no evidence for ascribing either this difference or the heterogeneity of rates among carnivorous parasite clades to clade age, mode of parasitism, diversity of host clade, or host specificity. Greater diversification by phytophages than by other trophic levels might reflect simply greater average abundance of the resource used by primary consumers.

TI DROSOPHILA-C VIRUS AND DROSOPHILA HOSTS - A GOOD ASSOCIATION IN VARIOUS
   ENVIRONMENTS
AB To discover whether the beneficial effects observed when Drosophila C virus (DCVc) infects Drosophila larvae should be considered as a specific case or, as a general rule, the DCVc-Drosophila association was studied in different environments (3 host-populations, 2 temperatures, 2 viral dose). We measured pre-adult mortality, developmental time and number of ovarioles per fly. In all experiments, and, in all contaminated populations, DCVc could be considered, either a parasite since it increased pre-adult mortality, or a symbiont since it decreased developmental time and increased mean number of ovarioles. The viral dose necessary for the appearance of beneficial effects varied with population, temperature and life-cycle parameters. A sufficient number of viral particles appears necessary at a specific point in the host life-cycle for a beneficial DCVc effect on the host. DCVc does not affect the variance of any of these parameters. The observed changes in DCVc-contaminated populations were thus not a response to the selection pressure of DCVc. Two arguments support the association as an example of the ''cohabitation-without-struggle model'' and will be discussed.

VZV DNA was identified in 4 of 5 immune adults and 1 susceptible sibling when sampled within 3 days of recognition of a household case of varicella.

Mosquitoes reared at low temperature (19-degrees-C) were significantly more susceptible to infection with RVF virus (infection rate = 70%, 158 of 226) than were those mosquitoes reared at 26-degrees-C (infection rate = 48%, 135 of 280), regardless of the temperature at which mosquitoes were held after exposure to virus (19 or 26-degrees-C). Likewise, for Ae. taeniorhynchus exposed to V-EE virus, the infection rate in mosquitoes reared at low temperature (97%, 236 of 243) was significantly greater than was that for mosquitoes reared at 26-degrees-C (78%, 217 of 280), regardless of the temperature at which mosquitoes were held after exposure to virus (19 or 26-degrees-C). Conversely, in mosquitoes infected with either RVF or VEE virus, virus disseminated from the midgut to the hemocoel more rapidly in mosquitoes held at 26-degrees-C than in those held at 19-degrees-C, regardless of the rearing temperature. Thus, a combination of low larval-rearing temperature and warm adult-holding temperature resulted in the most efficient mosquito transmission of both viruses.

TI PAIRING PROBABILITY OF SCHISTOSOMES RELATED TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION AMONG

AB Schistosomes are dioecious blood helminth parasites of mammals, including humans, and are responsible for schistosomiasis in tropical countries. The distribution patterns of worms among their host populations and the pairing probabilities of female schistosomes are of considerable importance in understanding transmission dynamics of this parasite. Data were obtained from field studies carried out over 8 yr on natural populations of Schistosoma mansoni, a human parasite but heavily infecting rats (Rattus rattus) in Guadeloupe. The distribution of male and female worms within the whole host population was fitted to a negative binomial, and the aggregation coefficient was estimated. The observed prevalence of male-female pairs, the observed prevalence of worms, and the observed pairing probability were calculated. Results demonstrate a strongly clumped worm distribution. Observed pairing probabilities of female worms in cases where male and female schistosomes are aggregated together within the host population are of the same order (phi(obs) ranging from 0.83 to 0.97) as the expected values obtained with the May (1977) model but significantly higher than in cases where the sexes are aggregated separately. A disequilibrated sex ratio biased towards male schistosomes increases the pairing probabilities of female worms.

TI EVOLUTION OF HOST-PARASITE DIVERSITY
AB Hosts and parasites often have extensive genetic diversity for resistance and virulence (host range). Qualitative diversity occurs when the success of attack is an all-or-nothing response that varies according to the genotypes of the host and parasite. Quantitative diversity occurs when the success of attack is a graded response that depends on additive genetic variation in the host and parasite. Community diversity occurs when parasites vary in the success with which they can attack different host species, leading to a mixture of specialists and generalists. I developed a series of models that classify components of host-parasite interactions according to whether they cause stabilizing or disruptive selection for resistance and virulence. Stabilizing selection reduces diversity by favoring a single optimal phenotype. Disruptive selection creates diversity by favoring a mixture of widely separated phenotypes. The evolution of maximal resistance and virulence are opposed by one of three forces: metabolic costs, frequency dependence, or negative genetic correlations among beneficial traits. The models predict that qualitatively inherited resistance and virulence traits typically cause greater diversity than quantitatively inherited traits. However, each natural system is composed of many stabilizing factors that reduce diversity and disruptive factors that promote diversity. I advocate a style of modeling in which families of related assumptions are compared by their equilibrium properties, and general conclusions from equilibrium properties are tested by complete dynamical analysis. The comparison among models highlights the need for empirical studies that compare levels of diversity among related host-parasite systems.

For comparison, neonatal murine microglial cells were also studied.

Treatment of astrocytes with interferon (IFN)-gamma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) had no apparent effect on the survival or growth of T. gondii. Microglia, on the other hand, had both an intrinsic phagocytosis-associated antitoxoplasma activity and a nitric oxide-dependent inhibitory activity that was up-regulated by IFN-gamma and LPS. The results of this study suggest that in contrast to microglial cells, astrocytes may provide a safe harbor within the CNS for T. gondii.

Macrophages play a significant role in the host defenses against Aspergillus organisms by ingesting conidia and preventing their germination to hyphae. The antifungal activity of peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from 19 HIV-infected children was compared with that of 16 normal controls. The phagocytic activity of patients' MDM, measured as percentage of phagocytosis, was significantly decreased compared with normal donors (P = .014). In addition, the inhibitory activity of MDM on germination of intracellular A. fumigatus conidia was significantly impaired in patients compared with normal controls (P = .016). There was no significant difference in the defects between patients with lower or higher CD4 lymphocyte counts. Impairment of antifungal activity of macrophages may contribute to the susceptibility of HIV-infected patients to aspergillosis.

TI INSIGHT INTO THE INFECTION DYNAMICS OF THE AIDS EPIDEMIC - A BIRTH
   COHORT ANALYSIS OF NEW-YORK-CITY AIDS MORTALITY
AB The authors analyzed the secular trends of New York City acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) mortality from 1980 through the first quarter of 1991 using birth cohort techniques to provide insight into reasons for temporal changes in growth of the epidemic. By disaggregating AIDS mortality data into composite birth cohorts, the authors determined that the slowing in the growth of the epidemic is a result of a leveling or decline in AIDS deaths in male birth cohorts born before 1950 and a continued growth in younger male and all female birth cohorts. This phenomenon is believed to largely reflect earlier human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection patterns associated with age-related risk behaviors; however, to some lesser extent, it could also reflect age-related host factors or therapies that may influence the time from HIV-1 infection to death. The findings support the hypothesis that the early infection dynamics of the epidemic were differentially related to age and sex, which resulted in a diffusion of infection from older to younger cohorts and from males to females over time. The future growth of the epidemic will largely depend upon the infection patterns of younger birth cohorts. This method of analyzing AIDS incidence or mortality data may contribute to a better understanding of earlier patterns of HIV-1 infection within a defined population, which will be useful for targeting prevention efforts and improving AIDS forecasting methods.

TI SPECIFICITY VERSUS DETECTABLE POLYMORPHISM IN HOST-PARASITE GENETICS
AB Detectable polymorphism of host resistance and parasite host range is a poor guide to the specificity of a host-parasite interaction. I analyse a simple haploid model to support this claim. The model assumes that the true specificity is 'matching-allele', in which each of n host alleles causes resistance to only one of n different parasite alleles. The detectable polymorphism in samples from a matching-allele system would lead one to infer the gene-for-gene specificity commonly observed in plant-pathogen interactions. Gene-for-gene and matching-allele specificity require very different fitness assumptions to explain observed patterns of polymorphism. Yet models for each type of specificity can easily be constructed that fit the available data. In addition, the currently favoured 'elicitor-receptor' model for the biochemistry of plant-pathogen recognition agrees equally well with gene-for-gene or matching-allele specificity. I do not claim that the simple matching-allele specificity is the correct model for plant-pathogen genetics. My point is that one cannot reconstruct both specificity and population history from patterns of resistance among host-parasite pairs in a sample. I draw two conclusions: first, inferred specificity and polymorphism are only useful when compared with a family of theoretical models; and secondly, biochemical models of specificity must be tested by their population genetic consequences.

TI PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN YEAST AS AN APPROACH TO PRODUCTION OF RECOMBINANT
   MALARIA ANTIGENS
AB The selection of a system suitable for expression of recombinant malaria antigens for vaccine development is, in the final analysis, empirical. However, experience gained with both malaria antigens and other recombinant proteins has provided helpful guidelines. Recombinant DNA technology has been successfully applied to the development of vaccines against a number of human diseases. Far example, recombinant DNA-derived hepatitis B virus surface antigen has been produced from bath prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Yeast has been demonstrated to be an excellent host far the expression of recombinant proteins with uses in diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine production. Both intracellular and secretory systems have been developed and optimized for the production of high levels of recombinant proteins. Recombinant DNA technology, and in particular yeast expression systems, have been successfully used to produce malaria antigens, several of which have been protective in various animal models. In contrast, attempts to produce sufficient quantities of antigens for a malaria vaccine from in vitro cultures of the malaria parasite have been unsuccessful. Recombinant proteins can be produced and purified from yeast in large quantities and at low cost, each being requirements for a vaccine to be used in a global vaccination program against malaria.

TI HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS INFECTION AND CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS -
   PROTECTIVE IMMUNE-RESPONSES
AB Cryptosporidium parvum is an ubiquitous protozoan parasite that infects the gastrointestinal track, leading to enteritis. The course of the disease is closely linked to the immunocompetence of the host. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, the CD4 cell count is the best marker of the ability of the immune system to clear Cryptosporidium infection at the mucosal surface. In HIV seropositive persons who have cleared Cryptosporidium infection, levels of specific anti-Cyptosporidium secretory IgA are elevated compared with persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic cryptosporidiosis. In contrast, anti-Cryptosporidium serum antibody responses are much greater in persons with AIDS and chronic Cryptosporidium infection. Secretory antibody is also effective in neutralizing Cryptosporidium infection in vitro. Secretory IgA may be responsible for recovery from infection or may only be a marker for an effective immune response at the mucosal surface. Specific defeats in secretory antibody responses in patients with AIDS and cryptosporidiosis may be overcome with the development of murine or human monoclonal antibodies for oral immunotherapy.

TI STUDIES ON THE PREVALENCE OF LEISHMANIN SKIN-TEST POSITIVITY IN THE
   BARINGO DISTRICT, RIFT-VALLEY, KENYA
AB The leishmanin skin test (LST) was applied in 26 clusters of an average of 97 individuals in Baringo District, Kenya. These clusters were centered around recent cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Of 2,411 individuals tested, 254 (10.5%, 155 males and 99 females) had a positive reaction. Among cured VL patients, the frequency was approximately 30% and no sex difference was observed. In the population as a whole, LST positivity increased with age to a stable level from approximately 15 years of age, reflecting an endemic situation. The level of LST positivity was 25-30% and 10-15% in males and females, respectively. Uninfected household contacts of VL cases had a higher frequency of LST reactivity than the rest of the population. This relationship was significant only in females and children, the prevalence ratio being 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.3-4.1), 1.9 (1.1-3.5), and 1.4 (0.8-2.5) for females, children, and males, respectively. The frequency of LST positivity was higher individuals living in wood houses than in individuals living in house with mud or stone walls. Again, this difference was significant only in females and children (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04), but not in males (P = 0.7). The results suggest that children and women are exposed to the parasite in or around their houses, whereas adult males are, in addition, exposed elsewhere.

TI GENETIC APPROACHES TO MALARIA CONTROL - HOW LONG THE ROAD
AB Malaria control schemes based on the yet untested concept of replacing vector populations with mosquitoes of the same species unable to transmit the parasite offer one more means of attacking this important public health problem. Research is underway in several laboratories aimed at defining factors that can act to interrupt the development of the malaria parasite in the mosquito host, the genetic basis for such refractory mechanisms, methods for introducing genes coding for refractory mechanisms into the mosquito genome, and methods for replacing vector populations in the field. The complexities of such an undertaking are many and varied, but the potential impact of a successful replacement strategy on the epidemiology of malaria in the target area could be significant.

TI POPULATION-CYCLES OF FOREST LEPIDOPTERA - A MATERNAL EFFECT HYPOTHESIS
AB 1. Many species of forest Lepidoptera have cyclic population dynamics. Although there are numerous potential causes, including interactions with predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and food-plant quality, strongly density-dependent interactions are often difficult to demonstrate. Both autocorrelation analysis and attractor-reconstruction methods have recently been applied to a number of species' time series. Results suggest that complex dynamics, i.e. cycles or deterministic chaos, may be more prevalent than once thought, and that higher-dimensioned models are necessary.
   2. We develop a two-dimensional difference equation model that relates the average quality of individuals to patterns of abundance. The delayed density dependence is caused by transmission of quality through generations via maternal effects. We show that the maternal effect model can produce patterns of population fluctuations similar to those displayed by one class of host-parasitoid models.
   3. We review empirical evidence for maternal and quality effects in dynamics of forest Lepidoptera. We fit the maternal effect and delayed logistic models to six species of forest moths for which delayed density dependence and maternal or quality effects have been found. The maternal effect model was a good predictor of the period of the oscillations for the species that we examined. We discuss why models of this type give better fits to moth cycles than do first order models with added delays.

   POLYMORPHISMS OF SINGLE-STRANDED VIRAL-DNA
AB Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA from regions coding for surface and core antigens were amplified and radiolabeled from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive serum samples by polymerase chain reaction, heat-denatured, and analyzed for conformation-dependent polymorphisms by gel electrophoresis under nondenaturation conditions. Analysis of serum samples representative of diverse and identical HBsAg subtypes showed a wide range of autoradiographic banding patterns, each unique to the specimen. Serial samples of a long-term carrier showed relative stability of banding patterns over time. Epidemiologic analyses using this procedure showed banding patterns of case subjects to be identical to those of persons implicated as the source. This facile and discriminatory approach to the differentiation of viral strains should be useful in the study of HBV transmission.

TI SUPERINFECTION AND THE EVOLUTION OF PARASITE VIRULENCE
AB Earlier ideas that parasites evolve toward becoming harmless to their hosts have, in recent years, given way to more analytic studies, focused on the 'basic reproductive rate', R(0), of individual parasites. In general, the biology of the parasite life cycle will lead to constraining relations between virulence (parasite-associated host death or reduction in fertility) and transmissibility: the maximum R(0) may then be attained by virulence being high, or low, or at some intermediate level, depending on the details of the constraining relations.
   Such studies have not generally included superinfection (where an already-infected host is infected by another parasite). Here we propose a general, but simple, model of superinfection, which is amenable to analytical treatment. In such models selection does not simply act to maximize R(0); superinfection leads to selection for higher levels of virulence, highly polymorphic parasite populations and very complicated dynamics. We calculate the equilibrium distribution of parasite strains and the maximum level of virulence that can be maintained by superinfection. We also note the equivalence between our 'superinfection model' and recent approaches to the study, of the meta-population dynamics of multispecies interactions.

A total of 954 animals were caught during bimonthly capture sessions over a two-year period. Positive thick blood smears were recorded in 17.6% of the 740 rodents and 7.3% of the 55 musk shrews tested. Variations of prevalence were analyzed in Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti, which represented 62.7% and 28.3%, respectively, of the animals captured, and 65.7% and 27.6%, respectively, of the animals found infected. Borrelia crocidurae prevalence was significantly different between captures and fluctuated separately for each species. Age-specific prevalence of B. crocidurae showed distinct pat terns, decreasing with age from 50% in younger juveniles to 3% in older adults for A. niloticus, while increasing with age from 8% to 23% for M. huberti. No relationship was observed with animal abundance or with the season of the year for either species. These findings suggest that the diversity of the population dynamics of host-vector-parasite associations in the Sahel region of Senegal may be a key factor for the relative stability of the borreliosis reservoir.

TI A GENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF NEW-WORLD LEISHMANIA USING NUMERICAL
   ZYMOTAXONOMY
AB More than 250 strains of Leishmania isolated from different localities and hosts in the New World were analyzed by enzyme electrophoresis, and their electromorphic profiles were compared with 19 reference strains representing most of the described species of this parasite. The 18 enzymic loci analyzed were very polymorphic, and the strains were classified into 44 zymodemes, each grouping strains with the same enzyme profiles. Each zymodeme was considered as an elementary taxon and the phenetic and phylogenetic relationships were determined by agglomerative hierarchical, ordination, and cladistic techniques. The different classification methods produced very similar results. The 44 zymodemes could be clustered into two groups, corresponding to the subgenera Leishmania and Viannia, by the numerical methods. The subgenus Viannia was shown to be monophyletic and could be further divided into species complexes representing L. braziliensis, L. naiffi, and L. guyanensis/L panamensis/L shawi, as well as some isolated taxa including L. lainsoni. The subgenus Leishmania, on the other hand, was polyphyletic, with New World isolates related to L. major clustered separately from the L. mexicana species complex. Most of the other zymodemes in this group represented independent taxa. The results confirm Viannia as a valid taxon but suggest that the status of the subgenus Leishmania should be further investigated. Leishmania braziliensis and L. naiffi were shown to be the most polymorphic species, while L. guyanensis, in spite of being the most common species found in this study, was remarkably homogeneous. The only variants were found south of the Amazon river. North of this river, the species was monomorphic.

TI PUERTO-RICAN PARROTS AND POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS OF THE METAPOPULATION
   APPROACH TO SPECIES CONSERVATION
AB Population viability analyses for a number of endangered species have incorporated a metapopulation approach. The risk assessments of these viability analyses have indicated that some extant populations should be subdivided into numerous subgroups with exchange of individuals among them in order to reduce the chance of catastrophic loss of the species However, routine application of a policy of extensive subdivision may have detrimental consequences for certain endangered species. We examine the Puerto Rican Parrot as a case history in which this policy is ill-advised. In 1989, a population viability analysis was conducted for the parrot. The document recommended subdivision of the existing small captive flock into three groups.  One of these captive flocks would consist of individuals transferred to a multi-species facility in the continental United States Subsequently, individuals from this facility would be exchanged with the insular captive population(s) and the relict wild flock For two reasons, implementation of this recommendation might have led to serious repercussions. First, this parrot, like many endangered species, has gone through a genetic bottleneck and may have a heightened susceptibility to disease- Multi-species facilities are a high-risk environment favoring the transmission of pathogens, especially when the facilities are located outside the natural ranges of a particular species. Second, the parrot is a K-selected species for which mate selection is idiosyncratic. This type of species often proves difficult to breed in captivity in small groups. Part of the problem in mate selection may be reduced by a Policy allowing frequent transfers of individuals among facilities, but such movements increase the chances of spreading disease in the metapopulation Thus, population viability analyses need to acknowledge that proliferation of captive subgroups accompanied by exchanges of individuals can in themselves carry substantial risks that must be weighed against the presumed benefits of subdivision.

TI PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES TO NORWALK VIRUS AMONG AMERINDIANS IN ISOLATED
   AMAZONIAN COMMUNITIES
AB The seroepidemiology of Norwalk virus infections was examined among Amerindians belonging to eight relatively isolated communities in the Amazon region by means of a new enzyme immunoassay using recombinant Norwalk virus antigen. The seroprevalence of antibodies to Norwalk virus ranged from 39% in the Maiogong to 100% in the Kubenkrankrein. The distribution of antibody levels varied greatly among groups; five of the eight communities had an antibody prevalence greater than 90% with many high values (> 100 units), while three had both a low seroprevalence and a preponderance of low values (< 100 units). While few children less than 5 years of age were sampled, no significant differences in antibody prevalence were noted among age groups, and the prevalence of antibody among children 5-10 years of age approached that of the older age groups. The low prevalence of titers of antibodies to Norwalk virus in several tribes living in these isolated Indian communities suggests that Norwalk virus may have been only recently introduced.

TI DENSITY-DEPENDENCE AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE IN THE DYNAMICS OF INSECT
   PATHOGENS
AB Many forest-defoliating Lepidoptera exhibit long-term cyclic fluctuations in density that span several orders of magnitude. One hypothesis to explain these fluctuations is that they are driven by pathogens with long-lived infectious stages capable of surviving outside the host. The basis of the argument is that, for realistic parameter values, a mathematical disease model incorporating such an infectious stage is likely to show cycles with the same period as is observed in nature. The mathematical model used to make this argument, however, is so simple that it may not be biologically meaningful. In this article, I extend the original model by including two realistic complications: density-dependent host reproduction and host movement behavior. Including density-dependent host reproduction greatly increases the likelihood of cycles; additional realism thus strengthens the original conclusion. Including host movement behavior makes the model more versatile, as it allows comparison of the model output with literature data on the spatial spread of insect viruses. This comparison suggests that the spatial spread of the viruses of Gilpinia hercyniae and Oryctes rhinoceros can be explained with a very simple model of host movement, without recourse to complicated mechanisms of dispersal. The introduction of host movement behavior also introduces the possibility of cycles of outbreaks in space and time simultaneously-that is, waves of disease that will reappear at regular intervals.

AB For the first time in West Africa, arboviruses were isolated from phlebotomine sand fly pools. One strain of Chandipura virus (a Vesiculovirus), four strains of Saboya virus (a Flavivirus), and one strain of a not yet identified virus were isolated. Three hundred twenty-two pools were established from a population of 33,917 sand flies caught in CO, light traps in the Ferlo Sahelian region of Senegal from November 1991 to December 1992. This is the first isolation of Chandipura virus from any arthropod in Africa. Saboya virus has already been isolated from small rodents in Senegal; thus, its transmission cycle probably involves rodentophilic sand flies. No strain of Rift Valley fever phlebovirus, which caused an epizootic in this region in 1987, was isolated. During the same time at the same site, 11 sand fly species were identified from 4,191 specimens caught on sticky traps, including Phlebotomus duboscqi, a leishmaniasis vector.

TI EVIDENCE FOR GUANOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE-BINDING PROTEINS IN
   TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI
AB The transformation of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi from the blood-borne trypomastigote to the intracellular amastigote constitutes a key clinical feature in the pathophysiology of Chagas' disease. That this transition occurs without change in the integrity of the plasma membrane of the parasite suggests the presence of biochemical structures, i.e., signal transduction systems, that convey information regarding the external milieu of the host so as to facilitate this transformation. In higher eukaryotes, it has been found that a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G-protein), composed of alpha beta gamma subunits, constitutes a critical component of this complex. Two closely related groups of G-proteins are substrates for cholera toxin (CT)- (Gs) and pertussis toxin (PT)- (Gil-3 and Go) dependent ADP ribosylation. In concert, they link plasma membrane receptors to adenylate cyclase, resulting in the stimulation or inhibition, respectively, of cAMP generation. In this report, we demonstrate the presence of bath groups of G-proteins. Cholera toxin-dependent ADP ribosylation of 42- and 45-kD proteins was demonstrable in amastigotes (AMAST), in the cytosol of epimastigotes (EPI), and weakly in trypomastigotes (TRYP), suggesting the presence of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein, Gs, in T. cruzi. Antisera generated against the as subunit of the Gs heterotrimeric protein (anti-alpha s) bound to a 45-kD protein CT substrate in the rank order TRYP >> AMAST approximate to EPI cytosol. Immunoprecipitation of CT-P-32-ADP-ribosylated membranes with anti-alpha s resulted in 42- and 45-kD proteins. However, no Gs-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase was demonstrable in reconstitution studies using cyc(-) lymphoma cells, which lack a functional Gs but possess a beta-adrenergic receptor and adenylyl cyclase enzyme. Pertussis toxin -catalyzed ADP ribosylation was demonstrable in 39-40-kD particulate proteins of EPI, less strongly in AMAST, and least in TRYP, consistent with the presence of inhibitory (Gi) and Go GTP-binding proteins. In support of this observation, immunochemical analysis of the PT substrates identified the presence of alpha o and alpha(11-2-3) in EPI, AMAST and TRYP, although, with the exception of alpha(13), both toxin and associated immunochemical PT substrates are decreased in AMAST and TRYP relative to EPI. Although the functions of these putative G-proteins in T. cruzi are still unclear, their expression may be regulated by the state of parasite differentiation. Despite our inability to demonstrate a function for these G-proteins in the adenylate cyclase signal transduction system, their presence in T. cruzi suggests that they may function in other signal transduction pathways yet to be elucidated. Future investigations of their function may reveal important targets for therapeutic intervention in this disease.

We undertook a case-control study amongst blood donors in the Trent Region to determine risks for HCV infection. A total of 74 blood donors confirmed positive for hepatitis C infection and 150 age, sex and donor venue matched controls were included in the study. Fifty-three percent of hepatitis C infected blood donors reported previous use of injected drugs compared to no controls; relative risk (RR) not estimatable (lower limit 95% CI = 20). Other risk factors were a history of: receipt of a blood transfusion or blood products RR = 3.6 (95% CI 1.5-8.3), having been a 'health care worker' RR = 2.8 (95% CI 1.1-7.6), tattooing RR = 3.3 (95% CI 1.2-8.7), and an association with having been born abroad RR = 3.2 (95% CI 1.1-9.5). No risk was shown for a history of multiple sexual partners, ear piercing or acupuncture. Injecting drug use explains more than 50% of hepatitis C infections in blood donors, a group who are less likely to have injected drugs than the general population.

TI ECTOPARASITE VIRULENCE IS LINKED TO MODE OF TRANSMISSION
AB Theory suggests that the evolution of parasite virulence is Linked to the dynamics of parasite transmission. All else being equal, parasites transmitted vertically from parents to offspring should be less virulent than parasites capable of horizontal transmission to unrelated hosts. This is because the fitness of vertically transmitted parasites is tightly linked to the reproductive success of the host, whereas the fitness of horizontally transmitted parasites is relatively independent of host reproduction. The virulence-transmission relation has seldom been tested because of difficulties inherent in comparing virulences of different parasite-host systems. We compared the virulence of lice and mites infesting a single group of captive rock doves (Columba livia). Lice, which were vertically transmitted, had no detectable effect on host fitness, whereas horizontally transmitted mites drove host reproductive success to zero. These results, in conjunction with a survey of the Literature, support the hypothesis that ectoparasite virulence is linked to the mode of transmission.

TI THEORETICAL-STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF HETEROGENEITY IN THE PARASITE
   POPULATION ON THE TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS OF MALARIA
AB Periodicity in malaria transmission has generally been ascribed to seasonal fluctuations in mosquito population density or spatial heterogeneity with periodic migration. In this paper we demonstrate that simple models of strain heterogeneity can generate periodic behaviour as a consequence of the interaction between parasite strains and host immunological defences. As the degree of cross-immunity between strains increases, the system moves from a regime of independent strain transmission and coexistence, through increasingly coupled behaviour, to the displacement of the strain of lower transmissibility by the strain with a higher basic reproductive rate (R(0)). Cross-immunity thus serves both to bring the strains into competition, and also to couple the dynamics. We find analytical and numerical results on strain coexistence to show how the range of possible outcomes may be read as an effect of the tension between these two effects of cross-protection.

   - EPIDEMIC OUTBREAKS AND WORK-ASSOCIATED INCIDENCE IN AN AGROINDUSTRIAL
   RURAL SETTLEMENT
AB A longitudinal study was conducted from January 1991 to January 1992 on the Urupa farm, a rural agro-industrial forestry settlement in Rondonia state (Western Amazon Region, Brazil) to define the parasitologic and clinical profile of malaria. Three cross-sectional, parasitologic, and clinical surveys were performed. In the intervals between surveys, malaria cases were monitored by twice a week medical visits to the farm and permanent local surveillance. The population of residents was approximately 170 and was characterized by high mobility. The slide positive rates found in the cross-sectional surveys were 0.5, 4.2 and 2.1, respectively, for the total population (Plasmodium vivax plus P. falciparum). Spleen rate values in children 2-9 years old were always less than 1%. However, this basically hypoendemic malaria situation was unstable, with occurrence of a typical epidemic outbreak at the end of the dry season. The total number of malaria cases recorded from January to December 1991 was 163, giving an annual parasite index of 970 per 1,000 inhabitants. However, sex and age distribution of cases showed rare incidence of malaria in infants and low incidence in children less than the age of 10. Male adults 16-40 years of age represented the main risk group. The observed clustering of cases allowed us to identify the place of work as a factor responsible for high incidence of malaria among adults. The general epidemiologic profile indicated that indoors transmission of malaria by the local Anopheles vector was low or absent.

TI FAILURE OF SCHISTOSOMIASIS TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE TESTOSTERONE LEVELS
   IN BRAZILIAN MEN
AB Schistosomes can decrease the reproductive potential or castrate both invertebrate (snail) hosts as well as vertebrate (mouse, rat, and hamster) hosts. To determine if host castration occurs in human males, we examined testosterone levels in the sera of 38 Brazilian males, 16-35 years of age, who had Schistosoma mansoni infections. We found that individuals with intestinal schistosomiasis exhibited serum testosterone levels similar to those of noninfected controls. Four subjects with severe hepatosplenic disease also exhibited testosterone levels within the normal range. We did observe a negative correlation between parasite load (as predicted by fecal egg count) and testosterone levels but could not dissociate this relationship from the effect of age on either parameter. Therefore, in contrast to rodent models, host castration does not appear to be a usual side effect of human schistosomiasis.

TI THE EFFECTS OF A SUBLETHAL BACULOVIRUS INFECTION IN THE INDIAN MEAL
   MOTH, PLODIA-INTERPUNCTELLA
AB 1. Baculoviruses are often highly pathogenic to their insect hosts, but theoretical studies have shown that sublethal infections may also play an important role in host population dynamics. Previous experiments have suggested that deleterious effects are caused by sublethal infections in a number of host-pathogen interactions, but these studies have been criticized on the basis of the methodology used.
   2. Using an improved bioassay technique, the dose- and age-dependent response of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, to sublethal levels of its granulosis virus was investigated. For the first time, significant sublethal effects have been unequivocally demonstrated in the development rate and reproductive capacity of the host.
   3. Sublethal effects on the development rate of male and female virus-treated hosts were exhibited in a number of cases, and these strongly suggested stage-dependence. The most striking effects were found in males and females dosed as 4th and 5th instars.
   4. The most dramatic effect on the host was a highly significantly reduced reproductive capacity in terms of egg production and egg viability. These effects were not stage-dependent, but with the exception of first instars, within a given stage, were consistently dose-dependent.
   5. The mechanism underlying these sublethal effects is equivocal, but the weight of evidence suggests that virus may be carried throughout development in a presymptomatic form.
   6. The consequences for the population dynamics of this insect-virus interaction are discussed.

AB 1. We investigate a host-parasite system in which superparasitism is a more viable strategy than is initial parasitism. Walnut husk flies (Rhagoletis completa Cresson) readily use sting holes made by conspecifics as oviposition sites.
   2. Superparasitism is probably a viable strategy because husks have sufficient food for more than one fly's offspring and are difficult to parasitize initially due to the toughness of the husks. Flies preferentially attacked nuts with significantly softer husks than those which were unattacked.
   3. Furthermore, flies oviposited in nuts with experimental oviposition punctures in preference to unmanipulated controls at the beginning of the season when husks were tough. However, at the end of the season when husks had softened this preference disappeared and flies readily attacked controls.

TI MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS IN THE NEW-YORK-STATE PRISON SYSTEM,
   1990-1991
AB Three epidemiologically linked multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks in 1990-1991 involving New York State (NYS) inmates suggested MDR-TB was widespread in NYS prisons. Inmate lists were linked to 1990-1992 TB registries, medical records were reviewed, and movement histories for inmates with MDR-TB were examined within and between prisons and hospitals. In 1990-1991, 171 inmates were diagnosed with TB. This rate (156.2/ 100,000) was significantly higher than the 1990-1991 US rate (10.4/100,000) and the 1986 rate among NYS inmates (105.5/100,000). Of 171 cases, 155 were culture-confirmed; 37 (32%) of 116 with drug susceptibilities determined had MDR-TB. Two other inmates with TB before 1990 were diagnosed with MDR-TB in 1990-1991. Of 39 inmates with MDR-TB, 38 (97%) were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and 34 (87%) have died. These 39 lived in 23 of the 68 NYS prisons while potentially infectious; 12 were transferred through 20 prisons while ill with MDR-TB. Policies of correctional systems on infection control and inmate transfers need to be reevaluated to prevent spread of TB.

TI OUTBREAK OF MULTI-DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS IN A NEW-YORK-STATE
   PRISON, 1991
AB In the summer of 1991, four inmates from prison A in Upstate New York died of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. To determine the extent of resistant tuberculosis at prison A and transmission patterns, the authors interviewed staff and reviewed medical records and inmate movement histories. Contact investigation results were examined to determine tuberculin skin test conversions and to estimate risk of infection and disease for inmates who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Eight HIV-positive inmates and one HIV-negative guard, who was immunocompromised with cancer, had multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Eight died, a median of 28 days after the first culture-positive specimen was collected. All isolates had identical seven-drug resistance and DNA fingerprint patterns. Of exposed inmates, 92 out of 306 (30%) had skin test conversions. HIV infection was not associated with becoming infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis (active disease or skin test conversion), but once infected, HIV-positive inmates were significantly more likely to develop disease than were HIV-negative inmates (p < 0.001). The source case transferred to prison A in February 1991, was ill with undiagnosed multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, refused medical care, and lived in the general prison population, where he transmitted the disease to other inmates. Lapses in infection control and laboratory delays contributed to this outbreak. Prisons should fully implement infection control guidelines to prevent tuberculosis transmission.

TI SEX AND POPULATION-DYNAMICS
AB Chaos has been found in many mathematical models of population dynamics. This suggests that it should be a common feature of natural populations, quite in contrast to the scarcity of systems where it has been demonstrated. We suggest in this paper that the reason for this contrast may lie in the reproductive system. Whereas ecological modelling traditionally deals with asexual organisms, we introduce sexual reproduction (and thus explicit population genetics) into the population dynamic models. As specific examples, we describe the effect of sexual reproduction on two models (a host-parasite model and a predator-prey model) which exhibit chaotic behaviour for many sets of parameters. The results show that sexual reproduction generally reduces the complexity of the system, leading to a stable equilibrium or other forms of simple dynamics, or at least reducing the fluctuations of the system. Thus the chaotic behaviour predicted by many population dynamic models may be restricted to systems with asexual reproduction.

TI EFFECT OF SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR CHANGE ON LONG-TERM
   HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS PREVALENCE AMONG HOMOSEXUAL MEN
AB Substantial changes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related sexual behavior have been reported by virtually every survey of homosexual/bisexual men in the last decade. This paper uses a behavior-based simulation to examine how such changes are likely to affect the long-term future of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic among homosexual men. Data from the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project in New York City are used to estimate age-specific patterns of unprotected anogenital contact and behavioral change from 1980 to 1991. Model projections are validated using New York City surveillance data on AIDS incidence from 1981 to 1991. The current levels of unsafe sex reported in the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project are shown to be almost exactly on the epidemic threshold. If this behavior were maintained, HIV prevalence would slowly decline in the population, but with just one additional unsafe sexual partner per year HIV would instead become endemic, with seroprevalence of about 65% in the oldest group and about 25% in the youngest. Transmission dynamics in the youngest group are analyzed in detail. For this group, the assortative age-matching bias in partner selection patterns raises the unsafe behavior threshold slightly in the long run.

TI SPOROGONIC DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURED PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM IN 6 SPECIES OF
   LABORATORY-REARED ANOPHELES MOSQUITOS
AB Sporogonic development of cultured Plasmodium falciparum was compared in six species of Anopheles mosquitoes. A reference species, A. gambiae, was selected as the standard for comparison. Estimates of absolute densities were determined for each lifestage. From these data, four aspects of parasite population dynamics were analyzed quantitatively: 1) successive losses in abundance as parasites developed from gametocyte to ookinete to oocyst stages, 2) oocyst production of sporozoites, 3) correlation between various lifestage parameters, and 4) parasite distribution. Parasite populations in A. gambiae incurred a 316-fold loss in abundance during the transition from macrogametocyte to ookinete stage, a 100-fold loss from ookinete to oocyst stage, yielding a total loss of approximately 31,600-fold (i.e., losses are multiplicative). Comparative susceptibilities in order were A, freeborni much greater than A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, A. dirus > A. stephensi, A. albimanus. The key transition(s) determining overall susceptibility differed among species. Despite species differences in oocyst densities and infection rates, salivary gland sporozoite production per oocyst (approximately 640) was the same among species. The most consistent association among lifestage parameters was a positive correlation between densities and infection rates of homologous lifestages. A curvilinear relationship between ookinete and oocyst densities in A. gambiae indicated a threshold density was required for ookinete conversion to oocysts (approximately 30 ookinetes per mosquito). The same relationship in A. freeborni was linear, with no distinct threshold, Ookinete and oocyst populations were negative binomially distributed in all species. Indices of heterogeneity in mosquito susceptibility to infection indicated that gene frequencies determining susceptibility fluctuated with time in all species, except A. freeborni where susceptibility remained homogenous throughout the study. This approach provides a framework for identifying mechanisms of susceptibility and evaluating Plasmodium sporogonic development in naturally occurring vector species in nature.

TI RATES OF ACQUISITION AND LOSS OF WUCHERERIA-BANCROFTI INFECTION IN
   CULEX-QUINQUEFASCIATUS
AB Rates of acquisition and loss of parasitic infection in the vector host of Wuchereria bancrofti were estimated using a new method. The age of parasitic infections was estimated from the abdominal condition, determined on the basis of SeIla's stages of blood digestion and ovary development, and parity of the vector host and larval stages of the parasite. A negative exponential relationship between age and number of W. bancrofti infections provided estimated daily losses of 25.3% and 33.2% of the initial infection from the resting and biting populations, respectively, of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. The rates per day of acquisition of infection estimated from resting and biting female Cx quinquefasciatus were found to be 9.6% and 8.6%, respectively. The mean minimum developmental time for W. bancrofti infective larvae estimated from the natural resting and biting populations were 8.9 +/- 1.41 (+/- SEM) and 8.33 +/- 0.85 days, respectively, which was somewhat less than the duration observed under laboratory conditions. Comparisons of the estimates (mean age, rates of acquisition, and loss of infections) based on the resting and biting data suggest that the rates are independent of the method of collecting mosquitoes.

The disease is widespread in pig-producing areas of the world but does not occur in Australia. A mathematical model of TGE spread within a pig herd is proposed and calibrated by reference to published data. The model is then applied to two situations of special interest; first to estimate the delay before detection of TGE (6 to over 30 days) when infection is first introduced into a herd of domestic or feral pigs, and second the effect of the disease in a population of feral pigs (could become endemic if transmission is high).

TI PREDICTING THE EFFECT OF A NOVEL VERTEBRATE BIOCONTROL AGENT - A MODEL
   FOR VIRAL-VECTORED IMMUNOCONTRACEPTION OF NEW-ZEALAND POSSUMS
AB 1. A model is described for predicting the outcome of biological control of New Zealand possums, using viral-vectored immunocontraception based on a sexually transmitted herpes-type vector.
   2. The model shows that success is possible in ecological terms, and identifies the probable circumstances under which it is achievable. These provide targets which a genetically modified virus must meet, aiding in the quest for suitable vectors and appropriate genetic modifications to them.
   3. In particular, the female reproductive system rather than the male's should be targeted, contact rate (i.e. number of potentially infectious contacts) per possum carrying the virus (i.e. infected, not infectious) must be in the order of one or more per year and at least 75% of females carrying the virus must be sterile at mating. Achieving this incidence is critical, with only slightly lower values exerting a disproportionately lower effect on possum densities.
   4. Spatial aggregation of the viral vector and the existence of a recovered and immune class of possums would both reduce substantially the impact of the control agent, but the presence of even limited vector-induced mortality would dramatically enhance it.
   5. Immunocontraception is likely to confer a selective advantage on the engineered virus by allowing multiple matings for an affected female. This will raise the contact rate and prevalence, and allow the vector to compete successfully with any existing wild strains.
   6. Given an appropriate mechanism of action on the reproductive system, viral-vectored immunocontraception of this kind would, if successful, offer a uniquely acceptable control for a vertebrate pest such as the possum, being humane, species-specific, cost-effective and environmentally benign.
   7. Even if immunocontraception caused only limited suppression of an otherwise uncontrolled population, it could contribute to successful integrated control by greatly reducing the need for conventional poisoning operations. Such integrated control also reduces possum densities more rapidly than would occur with immuno-contraception alone.

TI INCREASED VIRULENCE OF A HUMAN ENTEROVIRUS (COXSACKIEVIRUS B3) IN
   SELENIUM-DEFICIENT MICE
AB Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3/20)-induced myocarditic lesions occurred more quickly and were more severe and virus titers in heart and liver were higher in selenium (Se)-deficient than Se-adequate mice. NK cell activity and serum neutralizing antibody titers were similar in both Se-adequate and -deficient CVB3/20-infected mice; however, lymphocyte proliferation to both mitogen and antigen was decreased in Se-deficient mice. CVB3/20 isolated from Se-deficient donor mice and inoculated into Se-adequate recipient mice induced severe myocarditis. In contrast, CVB3/20 isolated from Se-adequate donor mice and inoculated into Se-adequate recipient mice induced only moderate myocarditis, similar to that caused by the original virus stock. Thus, the general population of CVB3/20 virions, as a consequence of replicating in an Se-deficient host, underwent a phenotypic change to increased virulence. These results have important implications for the emergence of virulent viruses.

   VIRUS-INFECTED PATIENTS IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL

Significantly more patients with diarrhea (85%) than without (66%) had AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) (P < .005). Of the potential parasitic causes of diarrhea, only Cryptosporidium parvum and microsporidia were significantly associated with diarrheal disease. Infections with C. parvum, but not microsporidia, were associated with the rainy season (P < .005). Thus, C. parvum and microsporidia are the most common intestinal parasites associated with diarrhea in an HIV-infected population in Brazil and are associated with advanced HIV disease. The association of C. parvum infections with the rainy season suggests that contaminated water may be important in its transmission; however, the source of human microsporidia requires further investigation.

TI COST OF RESISTANCE AND THE MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM IN
   HOST-PATHOGEN SYSTEMS
AB By using models which incorporate both numerical and gene-frequency dynamics, we investigate the conditions for a stable polymorphism in host disease resistance when there is a genetically uniform pathogen. We show that polymorphism is more likely when the difference in resistance conferred by alternative alleles is large rather than small. This conforms with the frequent observation of major gene effects on resistance. Moreover, when allelic differences in resistance are large, polymorphism is possible over a wide range of costs, including situations where costs approach values close to zero. The actual resistance cost that can be sustained in such polymorphic populations is dependent on the transmission mode and the intensity of disease-independent population regulation. Expectations regarding resistance costs in any particular host-pathogen system will be dependent on knowledge of the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of that system.

TI RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREVALENCE AND INTENSITY OF PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM
   INFECTION IN NATURAL-POPULATIONS OF ANOPHELES MOSQUITOS
AB Wild-caught Anopheles gambiae s. l. and An. funestus were dissected and their midguts were examined for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum oocyst infections. The mean intensity of infection and the prevalence of infected mosquitoes were determined for each sample, with one sample representing the mosquitoes caught in a single house at any given time. The patterns of infection were investigated using the relationships between prevalence, intensity, and variance within samples, and were found to be consistent with laboratory infections. The overall distribution of oocysts is characterized by a mixture of negative binomial distributions with means determined by the infectiousness of the human hosts, and a constant degree of aggregation (k = 0.0767) presumably determined by the development of oocysts within mosquitoes. The prevalence/intensity relationship was treated as a bivariate distribution to ascertain the effect of sample size on the accuracy of estimation, and to allow inference of intensity from prevalence. In mathematical models fitted to the collected data, sample size affected directly the minimum possible prevalence of infection, and the accuracy of both mean and prevalence estimations. Based on minimum possible positive prevalence rates, data from samples of less than 20-25 mosquitoes would provide unacceptable errors in prevalence estimations. However, natural oocyst rates are consistently higher than the minimum prevalence, and it is suggested that any interpretations from samples of less than approximately 40 mosquitoes must be treated with some caution. Such variation in natural samples means that prediction of intensity of infection from prevalence (or Vice versa) is extremely inaccurate.

TI WITHIN-HOST POPULATION-DYNAMICS AND THE EVOLUTION AND MAINTENANCE OF
   MICROPARASITE VIRULENCE
AB We examine effects of the vertebrate immune system on the evolution and maintenance of virulence of microparasites (viruses, bacteria, or unicellular eukaryotes).  We employ a mathematical model of the within-host population dynamics of an invading microparasite and the immune response.  In this model, the virulence of the parasite is proportional to its rate of replication within the host.  We show that if the rate of transmission of parasites from infected hosts is proportional to their within-host density, then the total transmission reaches a maximum for parasites with intermediate rather than low or high virulence.  When hosts can only be infected with a single parasite strain, then parasites having intermediate virulence not only release the most transmissible forms from individual infected hosts but also drive other parasite strains to extinction in the population at large.  We interpret the results of our analysis of the properties of this model as support for the proposition that the immune system may be responsible for the evolution and maintenance of the virulence of those microparasites that it controls and clears.

TI LIFE-HISTORY TRADE-OFFS AND THE EVOLUTION OF PATHOGEN RESISTANCE -
   COMPETITION BETWEEN HOST STRAINS
AB The dynamics of a 'resistant' and a 'susceptible' strain of a self-regulated host species, in the presence of a directly transmitted pathogen, is investigated. The two strains trade off differences in pathogen transmissibility (as an aspect of pathogen resistance) against differences in birth rate and/or resistance to crowding. Depending on parameter values, either strain may be eliminated, or the two may coexist (along with the pathogen). Coexistence (polymorphism), unsurprisingly, requires an appropriate balance between the different advantages possessed by the two strains. The probability of coexistence through such a balance, however, varies nonlinearly with the degree of difference between the strains: coexistence is least likely between two very similar strains. Resistance is most likely to evolve in hosts with the characteristics of many insect pests. Moreover, with highly pathogenic pathogens, a 'susceptible' strain may exclude a 'resistant' strain because its higher growth rate is more effective against the pathogen than reduced transmissibility. 'Resistance' can reside in parameters other than those directly associated with the pathogen. Although no cycles arise and no chaotic behaviour is found, an oscillatory approach to equilibrium is commonly observed, signalling the possibility of observable oscillations in strain frequency in the (more variable) real world.

Eight animals were injected with saline and 19 animals were injected with 4.0 x 10(6) mouse 50% lethal dose units of a strain of R. tsutsugamushi isolated from a human in central Thailand. Animals were evaluated at intervals for IgG and IgM antibodies to R. tsutsugamushi by an indirect immunoperoxidase assay, the presence of the pathogen in liver and spleen by murine inoculation, and the pathology of representative tissues by gross and microscopic examination. The infected animals began to show internal evidence of mild illness 7-14 days after inoculation, and exhibited no changes in behavior. Total white blood cell counts decreased on day seven (including lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes), followed by an almost equal increase on day 14. Gross pathology noted at necropsy was limited to slight liver and spleen enlargement accompanied by low numbers of abscesses and fibrinous tags present in the abdominal cavity. In addition to the gross morphologic changes, histopathologic lesions noted were all mild, consisting of vasculitis of the lung, activation of the mononuclear phagocyte system, abdominal mesothelial cell hyperplasia, and peritonitis. Rickettsiae were isolated from liver and spleen on days 0, 7, and 14, but not thereafter. Specific antibody response was first observed on day 14, peaked on day 21, and it decreased to levels observed in uninfected animals between days 120 and 180. The course of infection in B. savilei was less prolonged and more pathologic than that reported in wild southeast Asian Rattus species.

TI CONTRASTING ROLES OF RIVERS AND WELLS AS SOURCES OF DRINKING-WATER ON
   ATTACK AND FATALITY RATES IN A HEPATITIS-E EPIDEMIC IN SOMALIA
AB In early 1988, an increased incidence of acute hepatitis was observed in villages along the Shebeli River in the Lower Shebeli region of Somalia. This was followed by a large epidemic that lasted until late 1989. In a survey of 142 villages with a population of 245,312 individuals, 11,413 icteric cases were recorded, of which 346 died, corresponding to an attack rate and a case fatality rate of 4.6% and 3.0%, respectively. The etiologic role of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in this epidemic was proven by demonstrating anti-HEV in 128 of 145 sampled cases as a sign of recent infection with HEV. In three villages, where a special study protocol was implemented, the attack rate was found to increase significantly with age from 5% in the group 1-4 years of age to 13% in the group 5-15 years of age and to 20% for persons older than 15 years of age. Among cases 20-39 years of age, the female-to-male ratio was 1.5:1, which was a significant predominance of females. As in other hepatitis E outbreaks, there was a high fatality rate in pregnant females, estimated to be 13.8%. The epidemic peaked with the rise in the level of the river during rainfall, suggesting that the disease was waterborne. The attack rate was higher (6.0%) in villages supplied with river water, while fewer cases were recorded in those relying on wells or ponds for their water supply, 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively. In contrast, cases were more severe and had a higher case fatality rate (8.6%) in villages supplied by wells compared with those relying on river or pond water, 2.5% and 0.8%, respectively. This discrepancy was presumed to reflect the inoculum size of infection made possible with water from wells when the latter were contaminated. In the three villages subjected to a special study, person-to-person transmission within family compounds did not seem to be an important factor since 74.5% of the cases in affected compounds occurred less than one month after the first case, and another 6.8% during the second month; thus, the majority were not Likely to be secondary cases.

TI PERSPECTIVE - VIRULENCE
AB Why do parasites harm their hosts? Intuition suggests that parasites should evolve to be benign whenever the host is needed for transmission: Yet a growing theoretical literature offers several models to explain why natural selection may favor virulent parasites over avirulent ones. This perspective first organizes these models into a simple framework and then evaluates the empirical evidence for and against the models. There is relatively scant evidence to support any of the models rigorously, and indeed, there are only a few unequivocal observations of virulence actually evolving in parasite populations. These shortcomings are surmountable, however, and empirical models of host-parasite interactions have been developed for many kinds of pathogens so that the relevant data could be acquired in the near future. Aside from academic interest, the evolution of virulence has potential medical and agricultural ramifications that may provide evolutionary biology with opportunities for contributions to human welfare. For example, understanding the evolution of parasite virulence may help us design better vaccines, prevent the emergence of highly virulent strains in the future, and diminish the virulence of present pathogens. These potential applications notwithstanding, the usefulness of an evolutionary theory of virulence to social problems has not been demonstrated and is even doubtful in some cases. One promising area for contributions from evolutionary theory is in designing live, attenuated vaccines.

TI POLYMORPHISM OF BACTERIAL RESTRICTION-MODIFICATION SYSTEMS - THE
   ADVANTAGE OF DIVERSITY
AB Bacterial restriction-modification systems provide defense against foreign DNA by using a self versus nonself recognition mechanism. A great diversity of recognition motifs is maintained in natural populations. Circumstantial evidence suggests that defense against bacteriophage viruses favors this diversity. (1) Bacterial restriction enzymes can destroy invading phage DNA. (2) Phage DNA can mimic the host's self-recognition mechanism. The ability of the virus to pose as a mimic favors diversification of the host's recognition motif. Other observations suggest that restriction modification (RM) does not provide any significant defensive advantages in mature communities. (1) In laboratory experiments, bacteria evolve resistance to phage by mutation and selection of the receptors to which phage adsorb. The outcome of these experiments is a community dominated by bacteria with receptor-based resistance, with a low abundance of phage and susceptible bacteria. (2) Phage are rare and receptor-based resistance is common in samples from natural communities. I present a model that shows two factors determine community composition: resources and RM diversity. Communities in resource-rich habitats are dominated by receptor-based resistance and support few phage; communities in poor habitats are dominated by restriction-modification defense and relatively abundant phage. RM diversity is itself a direct cause of community composition. As diversity increases from a low level, the abundance of phage increases and the relative abundance of receptor-based resistance declines. Further increases in diversity cause a crash in phage abundance, yielding a stable community of diverse RM types but an absence of the selective pressure-the phage-that drove the diversification. Empirical studies must sample a range of resource levels and RM diversity to analyze the forces that determine community composition.

TI EVOLUTION OF INCOMPATIBILITY-INDUCING MICROBES AND THEIR HOSTS
AB In many insect species, males infected with microbes related to Wolbachia pipientis are ''incompatible'' with uninfected females. Crosses between infected males and uninfected females produce significantly fewer adult progeny than the other three possible crosses. The incompatibility-inducing microbes are usually maternally transmitted. Thus, incompatibility tends to confer a reproductive advantage on infected females in polymorphic populations, allowing these infections to spread. This paper analyzes selection on parasite and host genes that affect such incompatibility systems. Selection among parasite variants does not act directly on the level of incompatibility with uninfected females. In fact, selection favors rare parasite variants that increase the production of infected progeny by infected mothers, even if these variants reduce incompatibility with uninfected females. However, productivity-reducing parasites that cause partial incompatibility with hosts harboring alternative variants can be favored once they become sufficiently abundant locally. Thus, they may spread spatially by a process analogous to the spread of underdominant chromosome rearrangements. The dynamics of modifier alleles in the host are more difficult to predict, because such alleles will occur in both infected and uninfected individuals. Nevertheless, the relative fecundity of infected females compared to uninfected females, the efficiency of maternal transmission and the mutual compatibility of infected individuals all tend to increase under within-population selection on both host and parasite genes. In addition, selection on host genes favors increased compatibility between infected males and uninfected females. Although vertical transmission tends to harmonize host and parasite evolution, competition among parasite variants will tend to maintain incompatibility.

TI THE EFFECTS OF HOST GENOTYPE AND SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION ON TREMATODE
   PARASITISM IN A BIVALVE POPULATION
AB A basic assumption underlying models of host-parasite coevolution is the existence of additive genetic variation among hosts for resistance to parasites. However, estimates of additive genetic variation are lacking for natural populations of invertebrates. Testing this assumption is especially important in view of current models that suggest parasites may be responsible for the evolution of sex, such as the Red Queen hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that the twofold reproductive disadvantage of sex relative to parthenogenesis can be overcome by the more rapid production of rare genotypes resistant to parasites. Here I present evidence of significant levels of additive genetic variance in parasite resistance for an invertebrate host-parasite system in nature. Using families of the bivalve mollusc, Transennella tantilla, cultured in the laboratory, then exposed to parasites in the field, I quantified heritable variation in parasite resistance under natural conditions. The spatial distribution of outplanted hosts was also varied to determine environmental contributions to levels of parasite infection and to estimate potential interactions of host genotype with environment. The results show moderate but significant levels of heritability for resistance to parasites (h(2) = 0.36). The spatial distribution of hosts also significantly influenced parasite prevalence such that increased host aggregation resulted in decreased levels of parasite infection. Family mean correlations across environments were positive, indicating no genotype-environment interaction. Therefore, these results provide support for important assumptions underlying coevolutionary models of host-parasite systems.

All lines showed different phenotypic patterns of resistance and susceptibility. Genetic analyses indicated the presence of single dominant genes for race-specific resistance in all but one of these lines. That particular line appeared to carry two linked dominant genes for resistance. Intercrosses between lines in each of these groups of L. marginale detected substantially more linkage between the resistance genes in the Kiandra population sample than between those in the broader geographic collection. This result is interpreted to indicate a possible mechanism whereby resistance genes are generated in natural populations.

AB 1. Theoretical studies suggest that disease may play an important role in the population dynamics of insects, but there have been no long-term empirical studies that have examined this interaction in the absence of other important biotic and abiotic factors.
   2. In the laboratory, three virus-free (VF) populations of Plodia interpunctella were compared with three virus-infected (VI) populations that were continuously exposed to a granulosis virus. Data sets lasted for between 10 and 17 generations. Census data of dead adults were collected twice weekly and spectral analysis of the data was used to complement the observed population fluctuations.
   3. The VF populations exhibited discrete cyclic fluctuations with a period slightly in excess of one generation's length. However, the cycle period decreased significantly in later cycles in all three cases.
   4. The VI populations also exhibited discrete cycles, but with a period significantly longer and a population density significantly reduced compared with the VF populations. The VI populations exhibited no change in cycle period during the period of observation. The dynamics of the pathogen itself were highly unstable and there was little evidence for linked host-pathogen fluctuations.
   5. The cyclic fluctuations in the VF and VI populations appeared to be caused predominantly by density-dependent larval competition for food, whilst the pathogen was thought to be responsible for the fundamental differences between the populations.

   2.  The growth rate of P. argentatus was reduced, apparently as a result of lower food intake rates, when individuals of P. undulata were experimentally excluded from the host web.  The control spiders may have had higher food intake rates because the webs of P. undulata attract more prey items and/or increase the probability that prey fall into the sheet-web of P. argentatus.  These field experiments, together with field observations, indicate that the relationship between P. argentatus and its web guest P. undulata is mutualistic.  Mutualistic relationships between two species of spiders have not been previously recorded.
   3.  The higher growth rate of P. argentatus with P. undulata guests may substantially enhance the reproductive success of the host spider, either through reducing the time taken to form a clutch of eggs, or increasing the clutch size.
   4.  When P. argentatus was experimentally removed from its web, the numbers of P. undulata and A. fissifrons dropped, and eventually no guests were found in the web complex.  Experimental manipulation of the number of each guest species per web and observations of natural populations, revealed no correlation between the numbers of each guest species per host web.

TI NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE FOR RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS, UNITED-STATES,
   1985-1990
AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children and serious disease in the elderly and persons with compromised immune systems. To determine the temporal and geographic patterns of RSV outbreaks in the United States, monthly reports from 74 laboratories were analyzed for July 1985 through June 1990. RSV outbreaks were identified in 197 (93%) of the 211 laboratory years analyzed, with widespread activity beginning each fall, peaking in winter, and returning to baseline in April or May. Each year, the timing of outbreaks did not differ significantly between most regions; the few differences were small, and no region consistently had early or late outbreaks. These findings are consistent with RSV transmission within communities rather than between communities or regions. Health care personnel should consider the possibility of RSV infection in their treatment and prevention efforts from November through April each year in the United States.

TI PREVALENCE OF INFECTION WITH JUNIN VIRUS IN RODENT POPULATIONS IN THE
   EPIDEMIC AREA OF ARGENTINE HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER
AB We report the results of indirect fluorescent antibody screening for antibody to Junin virus in 1,101 sera from small mammals captured on two mark-recapture grids in the epidemic area of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Twenty-six of 29 seropositive animals were the cricetid rodent Calomys musculinus, for a 30-month prevalence of 7.9% in that species. Combining these data with previously published data on antigen detection provided an estimated total prevalence of infection of 10.9% for this, the principal reservoir species. Other infected species included two cricetids, C. laucha and Bolomys obscurus, and a predatory carnivore, Galictis cuja. Approximately half of infected animals simultaneously carried serum antibody and antigen in blood and saliva, some for 29-61 days. Except for C. laucha, which was associated with crop habitats, seropositive animals were strongly associated with the relatively rare roadside and fence-line habitats. Seropositive C. musculinus were predominantly males in the oldest age and heaviest body mass classes, and seropositive males were twice as likely to have body scars as seronegative males. These observations suggest that most infections were acquired through horizontal transmission and that aggressive encounters among adult, male C. musculinus in relatively densely populated roadside and fence-line habitats are an important mechanism of transmission of Junin virus within reservoir populations.

TI HIGH SEROPREVALENCE OF HEPATITIS-C INFECTION AMONG RISK GROUPS IN EGYPT
AB High prevalence rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) were recently reported among Egyptian blood donors. To confirm these observations and estimate the magnitude of HCV infection in this country, we determined the prevalence of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) in samples collected in 1992 from seven different populations of children and adults living in Egypt. Anti-HCV was found in 12.1% of rural primary schoolchildren, 18.1% of residents of a rural village, 22.1% of army recruits, 16.4% of children with hepatosplenomegaly, 54.9% of hospitalized, multitransfused children, 46.2% of adults on hemodialysis, and 47.2% of adults with chronic liver disease or hepatoma. Age-related prevalence of anti-HCV in a random sample of 270 inhabitants of a rural village increased progressively from zero in those 5-10 years of age to 41% in adults greater than the age of 50. Although the increased prevalence of anti-HCV among children and adults with parenteral exposures and chronic liver disease was expected, the prevalence of anti-HCV among persons representing the general population of Egypt was strikingly high. These data demonstrate the magnitude of HCV infection and its importance in chronic liver disease in Egypt. Future studies are needed to determine the routes of transmission of HCV in this country.

TI DETECTION OF DRUG-RESISTANCE MUTATIONS IN THE

   SEMEN AND BLOOD HIV-1 RNA AND PROVIRAL DNA
AB Different tissues or body fluids in which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can reside may contain viruses with distinct characteristics. Sixteen HIV-1-infected patients receiving zidovudine or didanosine were studied cross-sectionally and 1 patient who switched from zidovudine to didanosine was followed sequentially to determine if drug resistance mutations within the HIV-1 pol gene at codons 74 and 215 differed depending on the compartment from which the gene was isolated (plasma, seminal fluid, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or seminal nonspermatozoal mononuclear cells). Cell-free virus in plasma and semen developed detectable mutations first, followed by proviral DNA in seminal nonspermatozoal and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Study of the appearance of HIV-1 mutations in various compartments may help elucidate how the populations and dynamics of the virus differ throughout the body and determine whether seminal cell-free virus or provirus is the major sexually transmitted form.

TI MUTATION AND THE EVOLUTION OF VIRULENCE
AB The evolution of parasite virulence can be influenced by intra-host mutation of the parasite and competition among different parasite mutants in the same host. During the course of an infection, parasite variants may be generated that have some competitive advantage over the strains that initiated the infection. This intra-host competition may select for a short-term advantage. It can lead to variants without any transmission potential or variants with extremely high virulence. We develop a mathematical model which describes intra- and inter-host parasite evolution. The major conclusions are: (i) intra-host competition generates a virulence polymorphism in the parasite population; (ii) intra-host competition can shift the mean virulence beyond what would maximize the reproductive rate of the parasite in the host population; and (iii) the parasite population can evolve to intermediate levels of virulence even if there is no trade-off between transmission rate and virulence. Our model applies to highly mutating parasites with long infection periods, such as, for example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

TI KIN SELECTION AND VIRULENCE IN THE EVOLUTION OF PROTOCELLS AND PARASITES
AB The evolution of parasite virulence and the origin of cooperative genomes in primitive cells are both problems that balance cooperative and competitive interactions among symbionts. I analyse the tradeoff among three correlated traits: competitiveness against other genotypes for resources within hosts (protocells), damage to the host (virulence), and rate of horizontal transmission from one host to another. All three life-history components are strongly influenced by kin selection. For example, when genetic relatedness within hosts is high, each genotype is competing for resources with closely related genotypes. This competition among relatives favours increased horizontal transmission to colonize new hosts and compete against non-relatives. My analysis shows that many aspects of parasite and protocell evolution must be studied with the theoretical tools of social evolution. I discuss extensions that are required for a general theory of symbiosis.

   83-KILODALTON APICAL MEMBRANE ANTIGEN (PF83/AMA-1) AS DETECTED BY
   CAPTURE-ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY USING FULL-LENGTH BACULOVIRUS
   RECOMBINANT PF83/AMA-1
AB The 83-kilodalton (kD) apical membrane antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (PF83/AMA-1) is a potential asexual blood stage vaccine component. This antigen has been expressed as a full-length nonfusion, recombinant baculovirus protein (PF83-7G8-1) using the authentic predicted signal peptide for appropriate postsynthetic routing. When purified by a novel high-performance, ion exchange chromatography (HPIEC) method, PF83-7G8-1 induced polyclonal antibodies in rats that immunoprecipitated bath 83- and 66-kD forms of PF83/AMA-1 from S-35-methionine metabolically labeled parasite extracts. Using HPIEC-purified PF83-7G8-1 in combination with a rat monoclonal antibody against the highly conserved carboxy-terminal (CT) region of PF83/AMA-1, we developed a CT-capture-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure naturally acquired responses against the entire PF83/AMA-1 molecule. Analysis of populations from villages in Guinea-Bissau and in an area of high malarial transmission in Senegal demonstrated a very high prevalence (94-100%) of naturally acquired serum IgG responses to PF83/AMA-1. Analysis of these natural responses showed that PF83/AMA-1 may be a well-recognized asexual parasite antigen. A statistically significant age-related change in antibody levels to PF83/AMA-1 was observed in Guinea-Bissau. No such correlation was observed in the Senegalese population, although an age-related antibody response was seen for total parasite antigen. No significant correlation was observed between PF83/AMA-1 responses and the parameters of parasite load and malaria-related fever.

   - A LONGITUDINAL-STUDY IN 3 DIFFERENT EPIDEMIOLOGIC AREAS
AB A longitudinal study on the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite antibodies (Ab-CS) was carried out in 15 villages of three epidemiologic areas of Madagascar: the highlands, east coast, and the southwest region. A total of 3,967 blood samples were collected from November 1989 to April 1991 from cohorts of resident schoolchildren. The prevalence of Ab-CS in the examined population varied greatly according to the different ecoepidemiologic areas of the country. A correlation analysis was made between Ab-CS and P. falciparum parasite prevalence in the same population. High Ab-CS prevalence rates (25-75%) and levels (optical density = 0.28-0.76) were observed in the villages of the east coast (mesoendemic stable malaria). The Ab-CS prevalence rates varied from 0 to 37% in the highlands and southwest region villages (unstable malaria). The use of Ab-CS prevalence is proposed to be a useful and reliable seroepidemiologic marker of malaria endemicity in those areas of Madagascar in which malaria transmission is high and continues for more than four months a year.

TI GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF POSTMETAMORPHIC TOADS - INTERACTIONS AMONG LARVAL
   HISTORY, DENSITY, AND PARASITISM
AB I examined growth and survival of the European toad, Bufo bufo, from hatching to the approximate time of first hibernation. I varied tadpole density in experimental ponds such that individuals from low-density ponds emerged 48.5% larger than those from high-density ponds. In the laboratory, metamorphs from both pond densities were maintained in containers at densities of one or six. Nine weeks after metamorphosis they were exposed to 0 or 80 larvae of the lungworm, Rhabdias bufonis. A factorial experiment aimed to determine (1) the extent to which conditions experienced by larvae carried over to the terrestrial stage and (2) the effects of resource limitation and past history on a host's response to a potential pathogen.
   The density of metamorphs had the strongest effect on growth and survival: 18 wk after metamorphosis, those raised alone were approximate to 80% heavier than those in groups and they had 31% higher survival. However, larval history also affected growth and survival and affected how metamorphs responded to density. First, single toads emerging from low-density ponds were 14.5% larger at the time of hibernation than those from high-density ponds. The mechanism for this growth advantage probably lies in the consistently higher growth rates of single toads from low-density ponds, especially during the first 3 wk after metamorphosis. Second, survival in group containers was higher for toads from low-density ponds, especially during the first few weeks after metamorphosis when most deaths involved toads from high-density ponds. These results support a carry-over effect between larval history and subsequent performance in an organism with a complex life cycle.
   Infection with lungworms had no detectable effect on metamorph growth or survival. This result contrasts earlier studies on this system, possibly due to the relatively low worm burdens or low statistical power. Yet, the results may also indicate that the predicted impact of infection on hosts, especially those limited by resources, is not as straightforward as theoretical studies suggest.

The prevalence of anti-HCV was low; only five confirmed positives were found (0.14%). The prevalence of hepatitis B overall was 0.56%, but was 1.04% in women from immigrant groups. Hepatitis B carriage is therefore four times more common than hepatitis C carriage in the antenatal population comprised of various ethnic origins. The patterns of infection in the two viruses are reversed, hepatitis B being more common in Asian, S.E. asian and West Indian mothers and hepatitis C Toeing more common in mothers of white Caucasian origin. Routine antenatal screening for anti-HCV is discussed.

AB This study demonstrates a very high prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus among Icelandic intravenous (i.v.) drug users. Of 152 identified i.v. drug users 95 (63%) were shown to have antibodies to the hepatitis C virus. In contrast the seroprevalence in the general Icelandic population is low, (0.2%). Almost all cases of hepatitis C virus infection in Iceland are due to i.v. drug use or to use of infected blood or blood products. Sporadic cases with unexplained modes of transmission, a significant portion of hepatitis C infections elsewhere, are virtually non-existent in Iceland. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the sporadic community-acquired cases could be caused by blood transfer due to bites from insect vectors such as mosquitoes which are not found in Iceland.

Thus, nude rats were shown to be highly susceptible to the hantavirus infection. Also, infected nude rats (rnu/rnu) discharged the infectious viruses, to cause a prevalence of infection among normal cagemates (rnu/+), The i.fection system demonstrated here using Rowett rats (rnu/rnu) may provide a useful model to study the mechanism of the hantavirus infection.

TI SHARED USE OF FLOWERS LEADS TO HORIZONTAL PATHOGEN TRANSMISSION
AB Plant-pollinator interactions are based on mutual benefits; the plant gains fertilization and the pollinator gains food resources. But aside from providing rewards, flowers can be risky places to visit, for example if a predator ambushes during the feeding/pollination process. Here, we show that pollination may also involve the transmission of pathogens for the pollinators. Experimental evidence is given that a trypanosome parasite, Crithidia bombi, can be horizontally transmitted within populations of its hosts, the bumblebees Bombus spp., through the shared use of flowers. Important floral characteristics such as nectar availability or inflorescence architecture may also affect transmission rate. Therefore, in addition to energetic considerations, pollinator strategies could also be governed by the risk of contracting pathogens.

TI FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND THE DYNAMICS OF THE
   SILENE-USTILAGO HOST-PATHOGEN SYSTEM
AB Models incorporating density-dependent disease transmission functions generally provide a good fit for airborne and directly transmitted bacterial or viral diseases. However, the transmission dynamics of sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases are likely to be frequency- rather than density-dependent, which results in qualitatively different dynamics. Here, we present analyses of a basic epidemiological model in which the transmission process is represented as a function of the population disease frequency. In an extension of the basic model, we consider disease transmission as a probability function that assumes that the chance of becoming infected increases with the number of vector contacts. Stability analyses show that host-pathogen coexistence is possible in vector-transmitted and sexually transmitted disease systems in which transmission is likely to be frequency-dependent; the potential for stable coexistence is greatest for intermediate rates of disease spread and weak density dependence of host growth rate. Extension of the basic frequency-dependent model to allow for multiple contacts among hosts indicates that parameter ranges within which coexistence is predicted are thereby broadened.

TI FACTORS IN THE EMERGENCE OF INFECTIOUS-DISEASES
AB ''Emerging'' infectious diseases can be defined as infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. Among recent examples are HIV/AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (a foodborne infection caused by certain strains of Escherichia coli). Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. These include ecological, environmental, or demographic factors that place people at increased contact with a previously unfamiliar microbe or its natural host or promote dissemination These factors are increasing in prevalence; this increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasizes the urgent need for effective surveillance and control. Dr: David Satcher's article and this overview inaugurate ''Perspectives,'' a regular section in this journal intended to present and develop unifying concepts and strategies for considering emerging infections and their underlying factors. The editors welcome, as contributions to the Perspectives section, overviews, syntheses, and case studies that shed light on, how and why infections emerge, and how they may be anticipated and prevented

   EDINBURGH
AB Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type I sequences obtained from HIV-infected persons in different risk groups in Edinburgh were studied to determine the number and origin of virus variants and patterns of virus transmission. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 12 of 14 hemophiliac patients who had been exposed to a single common batch of factor VIII had closely related gag gene sequences. Sequences from intravenous drug users and patients infected through heterosexual contact formed another distinct group, and 2 other hemophiliacs formed a third group. However, epidemiologic relationships inferred from analysis of the V3 region of the env gene were less conclusive, especially when the V3 loop was taken in isolation. This appears to be due to the length of time since infection and the action of selection, which has favored the independent appearance of similar V3 loop variants.

The proportion of TB patients with MDRTB increased from 10% (27/267) to 17% (38/222; P = .03). Among MDRTB patients of known HIV status, the proportion with HIV increased from 16% (3/19) to 58% (22/38; P = .006). HIV-infected MDRTB patients were more likely than the seronegative ones to have initial MDRTB (88% vs. 56%; P = .03). Among 56 MDR cases with RFLP results, 12 had unique patterns; 44 belonged to one of six clusters. During 1990-1991, 27 (75%) of 36 MDRTB patients were infected with strains isolated from HIV-seronegative patients during 1987-1988. The increase in MDRTB caused by transmission from immunocompetent to immunocompromised persons underscores the urgency of TB control in populations with increasing HIV prevalence.

   A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY USING EARLY DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS
AB In sharp contrast to the considerable worldwide epidemiologic data available on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome incidence and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence, there is relatively little information about current levels of HIV incidence rates. The authors suggest a novel approach for estimating current HIV incidence rates based on a single cross-sectional survey and on an epidemiologic model, The approach is based on diagnostic tests for HIV p24 antigen to identify individuals in the preantibody or window period (time between exposure to HIV and appearance of detectable HIV antibodies), Individuals in the preantibody period are likely to have been infected very recently because the duration of the preantibody period is relatively short, The authors report data on the duration of p24 antigenemia prior to HIV seroconversion. This duration together with the prevalence of p24 antigenemia obtained from a cross-sectional survey are used in an epidemiologic model to estimate current incidence rates, This approach of estimating incidence rates may be especially useful in developing countries and high-risk populations in which it is difficult to follow cohorts to identify seroconverters, and in the design of vaccine efficacy studies in which current incidence rates are crucial for calculating sample sizes.

TI INVASION, STABILITY AND EVOLUTION TO CRITICALITY IN SPATIALLY EXTENDED,
   ARTIFICIAL HOST-PATHOGEN ECOLOGIES
AB We consider an individual-based spatial model of a generic host-pathogen system and explore the differences between such models and mean-field systems. We find a range of new dynamical and evolutionary phenomena, in particular: (i) in this system, selective pressure is substantially reduced compared with the corresponding mean-field models, and artificial suppression of the pathogen population leads to faster evolution and reduces evolutionary stability; (ii) unlike the mean-field models, there exists a critical transmissibility tau(c) above which the pathogen dies out; and (iii) the system displays self-evolved criticality. If the transmissibility tau is allowed to mutate, it evolves to the critical value tau(c). Thus the system evolves to put itself at the boundary at which it can exist. Observations of the individual-based spatial model motivate an explanation for these phenomena in terms of the dynamics of host patches involving their connections and disconnections. We therefore construct a patch model of this and show that this simplified model behaves in a similar way to the individual-based spatial model.

TI SEASONALITY AND EXTINCTION IN CHAOTIC METAPOPULATIONS
AB A body of recent work has used coupled logistic maps to show that these model metapopulations show a decrease in global extinction rate in the chaotic region of model behaviour. In fact, many of the main ecological candidates for low-dimensional chaos are continuous-time host-parasite and predator-prey systems, driven by strong seasonal 'forcing' of one or more population parameters. This paper, therefore, explores the relation between seasonal forcing and metapopulation extinction for such systems. We base the analysis on extensive simulations of a stochastic metapopulation model for measles, based on a standard compartmental model, tracking the density of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered individuals (the SEIR model). The results show that, by contrast with coupled logistic maps, the increased seasonality which causes chaos maintains or increases levels of global extinction of infection, by increasing the synchrony of sub-population epidemics. The model also illustrates that the population interaction (here between susceptible and infective hosts) has a significant effect on patterns of synchrony and extinction.

   SKIN-DISEASE VIRUS (NEETHLING)
AB British cattle were infected with the South African (Neethling) strain of lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) and their clinical signs monitored over a 3-week period. Different routes of infection were assessed for effect on the clinical characteristics of the disease by using a clinical scoring system. Neither of 2 animals inoculated onto the conjunctival sac showed clinical signs or seroconverted. The intradermal route produced local lesions in 21 of 25 animals, and generalized infection in 4. In contrast the intravenous route produced generalized lesions in 8 of 11 animals. Seven uninfected animals were housed in contact with infected animals for 1. month. None developed clinical signs or produced detectable serum neutralizing antibodies. Six of seven of these animals were then challenged and were fully susceptible to infection. The results suggest that the transmission of LSDV between animals by contagion is extremely inefficient, and that parenteral inoculation of virus is required to establish infection. The high proportion of animals with generalized disease following intravenous inoculation implies that naturally occurring cases of generalized LSD may follow spread by intravenously feeding arthropods.

The binding of H. capsulatum by patient macrophages tended to decrease with a decrease in CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts. Another major defect was that patient macrophages were more permissive for the intracellular growth of H. capsulatum. Macrophages from 22 of 58 patients showed a greater than or equal to 2-fold increase in intracellular growth compared with control macrophages. Thus, in addition to defects in cell-mediated immunity caused by a loss of CD4(+) T cells, macrophages from HIV-positive patients exhibit intrinsic defects in macrophage function against H. capsulatum that may contribute to the increased susceptibility of HIV-positive patients to disseminated histoplasmosis.

AB Apodemus agrarius was trapped in the fields and Rattus norvegicus was trapped within the houses in the villages of Jiande County, a region in the Zhejiang Province of China endemic for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Antibodies to hantaviruses were detected in three (16.7%) of 18 A. agrarius and 12 (13.5%) of 89 R. norvegicus, whereas hantavirus antigens were detected in the lung tissues of four (22.2%) of 18 and nine (10.1%) of 89 of these rodents, respectively. Three hantaviruses, one from A. agrarius and two from R. norvegicus, were isolated and found to be antigenically similar to Hantaan and Seoul serotype viruses, respectively. A serologic study of 437 clinically defined HERS patients conducted in Jiande County in 1988 revealed that the ratio of Hantaan (72.5%) to Seoul (26.8%) serotype virus infections was 2.7:1. Two epidemic seasons were found, with a major peak in November and a minor peak in June, and both were associated with Hantaan serotype virus infections that coincided with two seasonal peaks of the A. agrarius population and local agricultural activities in the fields. Seoul serotype virus infections occurred with a small peak during the months of December through May, in which in-house activities were dominant. All data suggested that Jiande County was an area endemic for HFRS, predominantly of the Hantaan virus serotype, combined with Seoul serotype virus infections.

TI SOCIAL BARRIERS TO PATHOGEN TRANSMISSION IN WILD ANIMAL POPULATIONS
AB Diseases and pathogens are receiving increasing recognition as sources of mortality in animal populations. Immune system strength is clearly important in fending off pathogen attack. Physical barriers to pathogen entry are also important. Various individual behaviors are efficacious in reducing contact with diseases and pests. This paper focuses on a fourth mode of defense: social barriers to transmission. Various social behaviors have pathogen transmission consequences. Selective pressures on these social behaviors may therefore exist. Effects on pathogen transmission of mating strategies, social avoidance, group size, group isolation, and other behaviors are explored. It is concluded that many of these behaviors may have been affected by selection pressures to reduce transmission of pathogens.

TI PARASITE-INDUCED MORTALITY IN MYCOPHAGOUS DROSOPHILA
AB Reductions in host survival due to parasitism have immediate effects on the population dynamics of both parasites and hosts. Despite its potential importance, parasite-induced host mortality has rarely been studied experimentally under natural conditions. We conducted a series of field releases of Drosophila putrida and Duosophila neotestacea that had been parasitized in the laboratory by the nematode Howardula aoronymphium. In 11 out of 12 independent tests, the proportion of flies that were parasitized declined significantly through time, suggesting that parasites cause host mortality. Independent tests showed that parasites have no detectable effect on dispersal of flies and that motherworms do not disappear from surviving hosts, thus supporting the conclusion that parasites cause significant host mortality in the field. Host mortality rate increased with worm burden, significantly so in four independent tests. This is a possible mechanism for density-dependent regulation of these parasite populations. Parasite-induced mortality was considerably greater among flies that had been released in the field than among those kept concurrently in the laboratory. Thus, laboratory or clinical trials may not provide an accurate assessment of parasite virulence in natural populations. These results support a central assumption of many recent ecological and evolutionary models, i.e., that parasites are harmful to their hosts under natural conditions.

We report a laboratory and field study in which the transmission parameter (nu) and mortality rate (alpha) due to nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) are measured in different larval instars of the cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Laboratory studies of food consumption and virus susceptibility were used to produce crude estimates of relative transmission rates in successive instars. Increases in the rate of feeding outstrip increases in virus resistance with instar, so we predict that transmission rates should increase in older larvae (assuming rate of intake of virus to be proportional to rate of feeding). This prediction was tested in a field experiment in which a constant initial density of susceptible and infected (moribund) larvae were reared together on cabbage plants for 2-8 d. Estimates of the linear transmission parameter (nu) did not differ between instars and gave a mean value of 2.16 x 10(-12) for all instars and time points. Causes for the discrepancy between predictions based on laboratory data and field measurements are discussed. Differences were found between instars in the time from infection to death (tau) (equivalent to 1/alpha, where alpha is the rate of mortality due to viral infection). Second-instar larvae died more rapidly once infected than third instars, which, in turn, died more rapidly than fourth instars. The effect of host population stage structure on patterns of viral infection can be pronounced and if recognized, may significantly increase the accuracy and predictive value of models of host pathogen systems.

TI VECTOR PREFERENCE AND DISEASE DYNAMICS - A STUDY OF BARLEY YELLOW DWARF
   VIRUS
AB Using simple analytical models of the probability of disease transmission and a spatially explicit computer simulation of the spread of the aphid-transmitted barley yellow dwarf virus, we examined the effect of vector preference for diseased or healthy hosts on the spread of an economically important plant pathogen. Our analytical models indicate that the effect of vector preference for diseased plants on the probability of disease spread depends on the frequency of diseased plants in the population. In a non-spatial environment with a high frequency of diseased plants, disease spread is favored by vectors preferring healthy plants. With a low frequency of diseased plants, disease spread is favored by vectors preferring diseased plants.
   The effect of vector preference depends on the amount of persistence exhibited by the disease. For persistently transmitted diseases, the vector remains infective for a long period after visiting a diseased host. Persistence increases the rate of spread for a vector preferring healthy hosts more than it increases the rare of spread for a vector preferring diseased hosts.
   Using a Markov chain model of disease transmission, we have shown that an increase in the spatial patchiness of the disease can lead to a decrease in the rate of disease spread by a vector capable of moving only limited distances. The effect of spatial disease structure depends on the preference behavior exhibited by the vector.
   Our spatially explicit computer simulation explored the effect of frequency, persistence, and spatial structure in a dynamic model. All of these factors were shown to be important in describing the impact of vector disease preference on epidemiology, Many of our results contrast with the assumption found in the agricultural literature that a preference for diseased plants leads to an increase in disease spread.
   These results may have implications for the evolution of pathogen-modified vector behavior and/or host attractiveness, Explicit knowledge of the interaction between spatial dynamics and vector preference will improve our ability to model epidemics and predict the spread of infectious diseases.

TI PARASITES AND FOOD-WEB PATTERNS
AB 1. We expanded two previously studied food webs, those of the Ythan estuary and Loch Leven, by the documentation of metazoan endoparasites present in each system. The resulting webs are the first in the literature to contain substantial numbers of parasites.
   2. Four versions of each web were produced, containing increasing numbers of parasite species and parasite-host links. Each version was analysed for four food-web patterns. food-chain length, linkage density, proportions of top, intermediate and basal species and omnivory.
   3. The patterns were not generally consistent with those previously reported in the literature. In particular, increasing the numbers of parasitic links increased the proportions of top species, and the percentage of omnivory, in both the well (Ythan) and poorly (Loch Leven) documented webs.
   4. These results were dependent on the choice of biological or 'tropho' species. Splitting the parasites documented in the Ythan web into separate life-history stages produced a greater conformity of omnivory and linkage density with previous webs, but a larger deviation of the proportion of top species from previously recorded values.
   5. The cascade model accurately predicts the length of food chains in the Ythan web. This suggests that the feeding hierarchy assumed in the model may exist in nature, but that body size alone is not sufficient to explain it.

TI COMPLEXITY IN PARASITE LIFE-CYCLES - POPULATION BIOLOGY OF CESTODES IN
   FISH
AB 1. This paper examines the population biology of two related species of bothriocephalid cestodes, parasites of teleostean fish, which live in sympatry. One species, Bothriocephalus barbatus, needs in its life cycle only one obligatory intermediate host, a copepod. The second species, B. gregarius, needs the same intermediate host first, but also utilizes a non-obligatory paratenic host, which is a gobiid fish, In the case of B. gregarius, definitive hosts can be infested via the intermediate host or the paratenic host, A simple mathematical model was built to investigate the effect of the addition of a paratenic host into the life cycle of a parasite.
   2. Results of the simulation clearly demonstrated that the maintenance or absence of infectivity of cestode larvae in the paratenic host could explain the observed levels of infection in both definitive hosts.
   3. Acquisition of paratenic hosts has two advantages: the recovery of lost infective stages in a previously non-suitable intermediate host, and an increase in the time of infection during which the definitive host could be infected as the result of eating copepods in its planctonophagous juvenile existence and by eating gobies in its predaceous older stages.
   4. Using the basic transmission rate as a measure of fitness, we also investigated the possibility of maturation of B. gregarius in the paratenic host, e.g. the acquisition of a new definitive host by the parasite. Basic transmission rates and numerical simulations suggest that there is no benefit for the parasite in evolving towards this strategy.

TI IMMUNE RESPONSIVENESS AND THE PATHOGENESIS OF HUMAN ONCHOCERCIASIS
AB Prominent antibody but minimal cellular proliferative responses to parasite antigen typify the systemic immune response of patients with onchocerciasis. While components of this response are proinflammatory (and antiparasitic), the primary force driving the immune system is the need to contain or limit inflammation around microfilariae that die in the skin or elsewhere at rates up to hundreds of thousands per day. These dying parasites initiate local inflammatory reactions, with the result being ''bystander'' tissue damage, which cumulatively determines host pathology. Local and systemic immune mechanisms to contain inflammation (e.g., blocking antibodies, down-regulating cytokines) are prominent in infected patients, and their delineation is crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of onchocercal disease in the skin, eye, and elsewhere. The degree of pathology appears directly related to both microfilarial numbers and the intensity of proinflammatory responses to them and inversely related to the effectiveness of specific mechanisms to suppress this inflammation.

AB From a cohort of female sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya, 163 women were observed to seroconvert to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and followed to study progression to HIV-1-related disease. The effect of several covariables on disease progression was studied using a Weibull proportional hazards model. The Weibull survival model was fitted to the observed incubation times. Estimates of the median duration to CDC stage IV-A and IV-C disease were 3.5 and 4.4 years, respectively. Condom use before seroconversion was associated with a reduced risk of CDC stage IV-A disease (relative risk = .64, P < .05). The incubation time of HIV-1-related disease is extremely short in this population.

   INTERLOCALITY TRANSMISSION (REPRINTED FROM AMERICAN JOURNAL OF
   EPIDEMIOLOGY, VOL 95, PG 178-189, 1972)
AB During one year, 121 outbreaks of variola major were detected in 99 of the 1717 localities within a rural area of West Pakistan with a total population of approximately 1.2 million. Only 19% of the outbreaks, representing 36% of the 1040 investigated cases, were officially reported, although potential strengths in the government surveillance system were also identified. Persistence of smallpox within the area depended on introductions from the outside, and more than one-half of all outbreaks of known source could be ultimately traced to cities. Within the study area, outbreaks with the largest numbers of cases and those in the larger communities were the ones from which smallpox was most frequently transported. The frequency with which variola was introduced into localities was directly related to population size and to the presence of medical care facilities, Trips between localities by infected individuals were extremely rare events, They were made most often during the late fall and winter, primarily during the incubation period of the disease, and did not differ in purpose, means or destination from journeys unassociated with smallpox. Individuals at relatively high risk of becoming introducers included the unvaccinated (primarily children under five), the unschooled and those not native to the area. Vaccination priorities based on these findings could increase the efficiency of smallpox eradication efforts.

TI BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL OF LOCUSTS AND GRASSHOPPERS USING A FUNGAL PATHOGEN -
   THE IMPORTANCE OF SECONDARY CYCLING
AB Persistent chemical pesticides can provide an effective means of control against locusts and grasshoppers due to prolonged activity of the spray residue. However, use of these pesticides is now prohibited, and nonpersistent chemical alternatives are substantially less successful. Here we show why it is expected that biological pesticides based on the fungal pathogen Metarhizium flavoviride will be highly effective in the control of both locust and grasshopper. We demonstrate, using novel population dynamic models containing measured estimates of horizontal transmission coefficients, that secondary cycling of the pathogen after a single spray application provides a biological substitute for chemical persistence. This has significant consequences for the economics of biopesticide use in pest control. Furthermore, by identifying that secondary cycling acts in a density-dependent manner, this study also highlights fundamental differences between conventional pesticides and biopesticides and how they might be used.

TI TRAVEL AND THE EMERGENCE OF INFECTIOUS-DISEASES
AB Travel is a potent force in the emergence of disease. Migration of humans has been the pathway for disseminating infectious diseases throughout recorded history and will continue to shape the emergence, frequency, and spread of infections in geographic areas and populations. The current volume, speed, and reach of travel are unprecedented. The consequences of travel extend beyond the traveler to the population visited and the ecosystem. When they travel, humans carry their genetic mak sup, immunologic sequelae of past infections, cultural preferences, customs, and behavioral patterns. Microbes, animals, and other biologic life also accompany them. Today's massive movement of humans and materials sets the stage for mixing diverse genetic pools at rates and in, combinations previously unknown. Concomitant changes in the environment, climate, technology, land use, human behavior, and demographics converge to favor the emergence of infectious diseases caused by a broad range of organisms in humans, as well as in plants and animals.

TI ALLELIC VARIATION IN THE HELICOBACTER-PYLORI FLAGELLIN GENES FLAA AND
   FLAB - ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR STRAIN TYPING SCHEMES AND
   POPULATION-STRUCTURE
AB Extensive DNA sequence diversity was noted in Helicobacter pylori flagellin genes flaA and flaB. PCR amplified sequences from 49 isolates were digested with AluI, HindIII, MboI or MspI, the resultant patterns were compared between the different isolates and these used to differentiate the isolates from each other. Evidence that the extensive diversity that was found in these genes is the result of reassortment of sequences between strains in the bacterial population is presented, such that a comparatively small number of individual sequence mutations can recombine together in random combinations to form a greater number of distinct alleles. Geographical differences in the predominant patterns in the flaA alleles were also observed and could reflect regional differences either in the human host population or in the bacterial population. In view of the genetic complexity of this species, molecular typing schemes designed to identify related strains may falsely associate strains if the methods do not characterize sufficient genetic sites to exclude chance associations of genetic markers in strains which are actually not closely related to each other.

TI PRECORE MUTANT OF HEPATITIS-B VIRUS IN CHILDHOOD FULMINANT-HEPATITIS-B -
   AN INFREQUENT ASSOCIATION
AB Serum HBV DNA from infants and children with fulminant hepatitis B (FHB) or acute self-limiting hepatitis B (AHB) and patients believed to be contamination sources was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by direct sequencing of the precore region. A precore mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 was found in 5 of 14 FHB patients and in 3 of 10 AHB patients. Among the 10 infants who developed hepatitis during the first 6 months of age, the precore mutation was detected in only 2 of 7 with FHB and in 1 of 3 with AHB. In 1 infant with FHB, a shift from wild type to precore mutant predominance occurred in the serum virus population during the incubation period. Thus, the precore mutation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause FHB in childhood, although its contributory role cannot be excluded. Factors other than precore mutations may be important in the pathogenesis of FHB.

HTLV-II infection status was highly concordant among spouses (P < .001) and between mother and child; of children aged 1-10 years, 36 of 219 born to seropositive mothers were seropositive compared with 3 of 997 born to seronegative mothers (P < .001), The strong associations of HTLV-II infection with age and with an infected spouse in adults and of infection in children with infection in their mothers strongly suggest sexual and mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-II in this population.

   ISOLATED DIRECTLY FROM SOIL AND FROM NODULES OF ALFALFA
   (MEDICAGO-SATIVA) AND SWEET CLOVER (MELILOTUS-ALBA)
AB Insertion sequence (IS) hybridization was used to define the structure of a population of Rhizobium meliloti isolated directly from soil and from nodules of Medicago sativa (alfalfa) and Melilotus alba (sweet clover) grown under controlled conditions and inoculated with a suspension of the same soil. The detection of X. meliloti isolated from soil on agar plates was facilitated by use of a highly species specific DNA probe derived from ISRm5. All R. meliloti obtained directly from soil proved to be symbiotic (i.e. nodulated and fixed nitrogen with alfalfa). Analysis of 293 R. meliloti isolates revealed a total of 17 distinct IS genotypes of which 9, 9 and 15 were from soil, M. alba and M. sativa, respectively; 8 genotypes were common to soil and both plant species. The frequency of R. meliloti genotypes from soil differed markedly from that sampled from nodules of both legume species: 5 genotypes represented about 90% of the isolates from soil whereas a single genotype predominated among isolates from nodules accounting for more than 55% of the total. The distribution of genotypes differed between M. sativa and M. alba indicating species variation in nodulation preferences for indigenous X. meliloti. The data are discussed in the context of competition for nodulation of the host plant and the selection of Rhizobium strains for use in legume inoculants. This study has ecological implications and suggests that the composition of A. meliloti populations sampled by the traditionally used host legume may not be representative of that actually present in soil.

TI HOST-PARASITE INTERACTIONS - INFECTION OF COMMON CLONES IN
   NATURAL-POPULATIONS OF A FRESH-WATER SNAIL (POTAMOPYRGUS-ANTIPODARUM)
AB The Red Queen hypothesis for the maintenance of cross-fertilization requires that parasites evolve to infect disproportionately the most common of local host genotypes and prevent their spread. Here we test the idea that digenetic trematodes are non-randomly infecting the common clonal genotypes in four populations of the freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. The results show that the most common clone was significantly over-infected in one population, significantly under-infected in two other populations, and proportionately infected in the fourth population by the predominant castrating parasite. We show that, given the expectation of time lags in the system, these results are consistent with expectation under the Red Queen theory.

Blood specimens and sociodemographic data were collected in 1989 from 2,339 blood donors residing on the island. A total of 73 (3.1%) of 2,339 were found to be HBV surface antigen carriers, and 518 (22.1%) were positive for antibody to HBV core antigen. Among them, 61 were positive for both markers and consequently 530 persons (22.7%) were considered to have evidence of prior HBV infection. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified age and low socioprofessional status as being related to HBV infection, as in many endemic areas. In addition, some major geographic risk factors were highlighted, reflecting a strongly hyperendemic situation in specific areas and the potential influence of horizontal transmission or unknown environmental factors on these particular populations.

TI GREEN TURTLE FIBROPAPILLOMATOSIS - CHALLENGES TO ASSESSING THE ROLE OF
   ENVIRONMENTAL COFACTORS
AB Green turtle fibropapillomatosis (GTFP) is a growing threat to the survival of green turtle (Chelonia mydas) populations worldwide. Recent transmission studies point to an infectious etiology. Several field studies suggest that high GTFP prevalence is associated with marine habitats that have been impacted by agricultural, industrial, or urban development. Environmental contaminants could be involved in GTFP through several plausible mechanisms including cocarcinogenesis and contaminant-induced immune suppression. However, an association of contaminants with GTFP has not been established. A broader perspective is needed when studying infectious diseases such as GTFP in complex ecosystems. Alternative explanations for high GTFP prevalence in some near-shore habitats include the following. a) these habitats provide an optimum physical environment for survival and transmission of the infectious agent; bi these habitats attract a high density of susceptible turtles or harbor a higher density of potential vectors, facilitating transmission of the pathogen in a density-dependent fashion; and c) these habitats may contain other stressors that render turtles more susceptible to GTFP. Application of scientifically rigorous criteria in the epizootiology of GTFP in free-ranging populations remains a formidable challenge.

TI POTENTIAL IMPACT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE ON MALARIA RISK
AB The biological activity and geographic distribution of the malarial parasite and its vector are sensitive to climatic influences, especially temperature and precipitation. We have incorporated Genera Circulation Model-based scenarios of anthropogenic global climate change in an integrated linked-system model for predicting changes in malaria epidemic potential in the next century. The concept of the disability-adjusted life years is included to arrive at a single measure of the effect of anthropogenic climate change on the heath impact of malaria Assessment of the potential impact of global climate change on the incidence of malaria suggests a widespread increase of risk due to expansion of the areas suitable for malaria transmission. This predicted increase is most pronounced at the borders of endemic malaria areas and at higher altitudes within malarial areas. The incidence of infection is sensitive to climate changes in areas of Southeast Asia, South America, and parts of Africa where the disease is less endemic; in these regions the numbers of years of healthy life lost may increase significantly. However, the simulated changes in malaria risk must be interpreted on the basis of local environmental conditions, the effects of socioeconomic developments, and malaria control programs or capabilities.

TI THE ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN A MICROSPORIDIAN PARASITE AND ITS
   HOST DAPHNIA-MAGNA
AB 1. Freshwater plankton populations suffer frequent epidemics of microparasitic diseases. The mechanisms which lead to outbreak and spread of these parasites are poorly understood. A set of experiments was carried out to distinguish between hypotheses explaining the introduction, spread and persistence of a microparasite in Daphnia magna.
   2. Transmission of the microsporidian parasite Pleistophora a intestinalis is horizontal through ingestion of free-floating parasite spores, or from spores taken up from pond sediments by the host. At 4 degrees C parasite spores remained infectious after 3 months, explaining how the parasite persists through periods of host diapause.
   3. Parasite transmission probability was inversely related to the water volume in which infected and uninfected hosts were kept. The same density effect was found for the intensity of infections.
   4. Host nutritional conditions did not influence parasite multiplication inside the host. However, well-fed hosts became infected more often than poorly fed daphnids of the same age, which can best be explained by their larger size, and consequently their higher filtering rates.
   5. Both sexes and all life stages tested of the host were susceptible to infection. Growth and transmission of the parasite was greatly impaired at 6 degrees C, but no differences in parasite growth were found between 12, 16, 20 and 23 degrees C.
   6. The impact of P. intestinalis on host fecundity was inversely correlated with initial spore dose.
   7. Long spore survival outside the host, reduced transmission at low temperatures and density-dependent transmission were the main factors in the interaction of P. intestinalis and its host D. magna. The results are consistent with field studies of other horizontally transmitted microsporidian parasites in cladoceran and rotifer populations.

We obtained a household response rate of 95% (98 of 103) and blood samples from 84% (345 of 410) of the participants. Dengue incidence, as volunteered by the respondents, was 5% (21 of 410), but serologic diagnosis (immunoglobulin M and IgG-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [ELISA]) indicated a recent infection rate of 18% (59 of 331). The presence of anti-dengue antibodies was detected in 277 (84%) of 331 persons tested. In our final sample of 65 households and 112 persons, we analyzed (by univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods) the association of 12 entomologic, environmental, and behavioral variables with the proportion of household members with laboratory-confirmed recent dengue. The number of female Aedes aegpti per person was the only significant (P = 0.02) household risk factor. The results of our study underscore the importance of intradomiciliary mosquito populations in dengue transmission, and may serve as a guide for mosquito control efforts.

TI THE DYNAMICS OF INSECT-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS IN STAGE-STRUCTURED
   POPULATIONS
AB Few insects are susceptible to pathogens at all stages of their life cycle. The population dynamic consequences of introducing age and stage structure are examined through the use of models of insect-pathogen interactions in which hosts are assumed to contract the disease by ingesting infectious particles in the environment. The models are phrased as delay-differential equations that assume constant demographic parameters within age or stage classes. The first and simplest model assumes that only the adult insect is susceptible to infection, while the second model assumes a juvenile susceptible stage. Two further Variants of the second model are considered: one in which the disease does not have a fixed incubation period and one that assumes that a reservoir for pathogen particles exists in the environment. Both linear and nonlinear transmission processes are examined. The introduction of explicit time delays has little effect on model equilibria but strongly influences dynamics. Multigenerational host-pathogen cycles are predicted by all models, although the parameter space in which they occur is markedly model specific. A type of population dynamics Previously observed in host-parasitoid models, but not in insect-pathogen models, was also found: cycles with a period of one host generation or of a fraction of a host generation. This dynamic behavior arises through the interaction of unequal time delays in the two populations. The absence of a fixed incubation period and the presence of a pathogen reservoir both tend to be stabilizing. The models developed in this article are most applicable to insect-pathogen interactions in tropical or subtropical environments, where populations are not synchronized by a severe winter.

TI HOST DISPERSAL AND THE SPATIAL SPREAD OF INSECT PATHOGENS
AB Empirical studies of the spatial spread of insect pathogens have emphasized the importance of high dispersal rates, but typically rely strictly on observational data. In contrast, existing mathematical models on the spatial spread of infectious diseases have suggested that a highly infectious disease can spread rapidly even if the dispersal rate of its host is low; such models, however, are largely untested. To understand how host dispersal and disease infectiousness affect the spatial spread of infectious diseases, we performed a field experiment in which we released a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) into two experimentally established, disease-free gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations. We simultaneously and independently measured the long-distance dispersal of ballooning, first-instar, gypsy moth larvae, the stage in which dispersal is by far the greatest. Surprisingly, dispersal by ballooning was a good predictor of NPV spread only in the first few weeks of spread. Subsequently, the virus spread much farther and less directionally than did ballooning larvae. No infections appeared in control plots that started with only uninfected larvae, confirming that the virus that we released caused the epizootic in our experimental populations. On the theory that the additional spread was due to a combination of small-scale larval dispersal and a high rate of disease transmission, we compared our data to the predictions of a mathematical model for the spatial spread of insect pathogens that combines disease transmission and small-scale host dispersal. By using independent estimates of each of the model parameters, we used the model to make post hoc predictions of the rate of spread of the virus from an initial distribution dictated by larval ballooning. Although the model included both initial long-distance dispersal by larval ballooning and subsequent short-distance dispersal by larval crawling, it poorly matched the observed distribution of the virus. An alternative and as yet untested hypothesis is that the observed spread of the virus may be due to mechanical vectoring by a parasitoid fly, a mechanism for which there are as yet no available mathematical theory or relevant field data.

TI SEROLOGICAL STUDIES OF INFLUENZA-VIRUSES IN PIGS IN GREAT-BRITAIN 1991-2
AB Samples from a sow serum bank representative of the pig population of Great Britain collected during 1991-2, were examined for antibodies to influenza A, B and C viruses, using viruses which had been isolated from a variety of hosts. For influenza-A viruses there was evidence of the continued circulation of classical swine' H1N1 virus (26 %) seroprevalence), and human H3N2 viruses (39 %) which are antigenically most closely-related to A/Port Chalmers/1/73 virus. In addition antibodies were detected to A/swine/England/201635/92 (8 %), a strain of H3N2 virus which appears to have arisen by antigenic drift from conventional H3N2 swine strains. Specific antibodies (2%) were detected to an H1N1. virus (A/swine/England/195852/99) related most closely to avian H1N1 strains. In tests with human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, excluding isolates from pigs, the highest seroprevalence was detected to the prevailing strains from the human population. Serological tests with avian H4 and H10, human H2, equine 1 and 2 influenza A viruses were all negative. Seven pigs seropositive by haemagglutination-inhibition, virus neutralization and immunoblotting assays for antibody to influenza B virus, were randomly distributed geographically suggesting that influenza B viruses may be transmitted to pigs but fail to spread. The seroprevalence to influenza C viruses was 9.9 % indicating that these viruses are widespread in pigs. These results provide further evidence that the pig: can be infected by a number of influenza viruses, some of which may have significance in the epidemiology of human influenza.

TI THE POTENTIAL FOR COEVOLUTION IN A HOST-PARASITOID SYSTEM .1.
   GENETIC-VARIATION WITHIN AN APHID POPULATION IN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO A
   PARASITIC WASP
AB For coevolution to occur, there must be genetic variation in each species for traits relevant to their interaction. Here, statistically significant variation in susceptibility to a parasitic wasp was found among pea-aphid clones collected from a single population. In a subset of clones that was tested further, wasps were found to oviposit in aphids from both resistant and susceptible lines, but eggs failed to develop in resistant hosts. Significant genetic variance in susceptibility provides evidence that this aphid population has the potential to evolve resistance in response to selection by one of its major natural enemies. Predictions of an expected response to selection based on the experimental measures of variation and field parasitism rates suggested that there should be a detectable change in susceptibility over the course of a season. However, an experimental comparison of mean susceptibility of clones collected early and late in the summer, a period of several generations, revealed no response to selection by the wasps. Aphids collected late in the season were as susceptible, on the average, as those collected early in the summer. Possible constraints on the response of the aphids to selection by this natural enemy are considered.

Among 17 HTLV-I carriers, 1 person who was seronegative and 1 who was PCR-negative were identified, gag and tax/rex PCR titers correlated with each other (r = .92; P < .001). Of the 17 carriers, 14 (82%) had high virus loads (geometric averages, 522 gag and 703 tax/rex copies/mu g of DNA; 95% confidence intervals, 38-7260 and 75-6594, respectively). Carriers with low virus loads had less than or equal to 2.2 gag copies. In the high-virus-load group, the gag PCR titers correlated with the antibody titers (r = 0.88; P < .001). The regression line intersected the minimum antibody detection level at 35 gag copies/mu g of DNA. These results suggest that a small percentage of carriers may be seronegative.

TI TOPICAL IMMUNOPROPHYLAXIS OF RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS
   (RSV)-CHALLENGED MICE WITH RSV-SPECIFIC IMMUNE GLOBULIN
AB The modulatory effects of passive antibody on viral replication, illness, and immunity were investigated in a murine model of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Nasally administered RSV-specific immune globulin (RSVIG) given prophylactically in a large volume (100 mu L) reduced illness and RSV replication in lung after primary challenge. However, passive antibody treatment diminished the host antibody response to primary RSV infection. This resulted in greater susceptibility to reinfection and an alteration in the composition of the immune response after rechallenge. RSV infection of lung during primary infection was necessary for complete protection of lung from RSV rechallenge. Nasal infection alone during primary infection was not sufficient to protect against RSV rechallenge of lung, suggesting that the immune responses in the murine system are compartmentalized. The influence of compartmentalized immunity and modulation of immune responses will be important considerations as new approaches for topical immunoprophylaxis of RSV are developed.

TI ANTIGENIC VARIATION BY POSITIONAL CONTROL OF MAJOR SURFACE GLYCOPROTEIN
   GENE-EXPRESSION IN PNEUMOCYSTIS-CARINII
AB Major cell surface glycoproteins (MSGs) of Pneumocystis carinii play a crucial role in host-parasite interactions during P. carinii pneumocystosis in AIDS patients, Genes encoding MSGs are repeated and dispersed throughout the genome and are highly polymorphic, MSG gene expression was found to be mediated by a DNA element that was termed the upstream conserved sequence (UCS). The UCS element maps to a single chromosome, is attached to expressed MSG genes, and encodes the sequence found at the 5' ends of most MSG mRNAs. The UCS is not highly repeated, but P. carinii populations contain many different MSG genes attached to the UCS, suggesting that different organisms in the population have different MSG genes attached to the UCS, Such genetic heterogeneity may be generated by recombination between MSG genes at the UCS locus and one or more of the dozens of MSG genes located elsewhere in the genome.

TI THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY TRANSMITTED
   PARASITES
AB We analyse a model of the transmission dynamics of a parasite transmitted both vertically and horizontally. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) of the parasite is shown to be a sum of horizontal and vertical components. We derive expressions for the equilibrium prevalence of infection for a mixture of horizontal and vertical transmission; prevalence can reach 100% if transmission is sufficiently high. At the endemic equilibrium, if prevalence is high, most transmission will in general be vertical, but horizontal transmission rates must be high to reach and stably maintain such an equilibrium. Surprisingly, for such parasites the highest equilibrium rates of vertical transmission are observed when horizontal transmission is very effective. We discuss the implications for assessing the importance of horizontal v. vertical transmission from field data, and we suggest some implications for the evolution of virulence.

TI DIFFERENTIAL MORTALITY OF 2 CLOSELY-RELATED HOST SPECIES INDUCED BY ONE
   PARASITE
AB Understanding the importance of parasites in affecting the biodiversity of host species in ecosystems is a central aim of conservation biology. Recent advances in ecology have suggested that differential parasite susceptibilities between taxonomically related host species may be a determinant of animal community structure. Although conceptually appealing, such an hypothesis suffers from a lack of field evidence. Here, we report that the populations of two congeneric and sympatric host species (Gammarus insensibilis and G. aequicauda), infected by the same parasite (Microphallus papillorobustus), exhibit a strongly contrasted pattern of parasite-induced mortality.

TI SEX ALLOCATION AND POPULATION-STRUCTURE IN MALARIA AND RELATED PARASITIC
   PROTOZOA
AB Here we demonstrate how sex allocation theory, one of the best verified areas of metazoan evolutionary biology, can be successfully applied to microparasitic organisms, by relating parasite prevalence and sex ratio in the Haemosporina. Members of this taxon, which includes Plasmodium, are parasitic protozoa with obligate sexual cycles in which dioecious haploid gametes drawn from the peripheral blood of a vertebrate host fuse within a dipteran vector. Consequently mating takes place within a highly subdivided population, a condition known to promote local mate competition and inbreeding and hence the evolution of female-biased sex ratios. We used an epidemiological framework to investigate mating patterns and sex ratio evolution within natural populations of these parasites. This phenotypic approach compliments more conventional biochemical approaches to the population genetics of parasitic protozoa. Data are presented which support a theoretical relation between transmission-stage sex ratio and prevalence across parasite populations. These results are consistent with a large inter-population variation in genetic structure and argue against sweeping generalizations about the clonality or otherwise of populations of these parasitic protozoa.

   ON INTERSPECIES SEQUENCE VARIATION IN RIBOSOMAL DNA SPACERS
AB Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes (Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus) are among the principal vectors of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus in the eastern United States; Cx. restuans and Cx. salinarius play secondary roles in the transmission and maintenance of the virus cycle. Accurate identification of these three species in field collections is required for epidemiologic studies of SLE virus transmission. We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for this purpose. Species-specific PCR primers were designed based on interspecies nucleic acid sequence variation in the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA gene array; however insufficient variation was detected to differentiate between subspecies of the Cx. pipiens complex. The primers were used together in a single amplification reaction to correctly identify specimens to species using genomic DNA extracted from whole individual mosquitoes, DNA from triturated mosquito pools, or crude DNA from mosquito heads or legs.

The efficiency of primary isolation for currently circulating (H3N2) strains was similar in Vero and MDCK cells. Of 72 egg-adapted strains investigated, 90.3% were detectable by hemagglutinin (HA) titration in Vero cells after the first passage and 51.4% after the second. The amino acid sequences of the HA1 region of influenza A viruses isolated and passaged in Vero cells were identical to those of their MDCK-grown counterparts. At low MOI, high yields of influenza virus were achieved in Vero cells by multiple additions of trypsin to the medium. After 20 passages of A/England/1/53 (H1N1) in Vero cells, the titer of infectious virus was 8.37 log(10) TCID50/mL, and virus protein yields were as high as in MDCK cells.

TI DISCRIMINATION BY FEMALE MICE BETWEEN THE ODORS OF PARASITIZED AND
   NON-PARASITIZED MALES
AB The detection and avoidance of parasitized males has been proposed to be a component of female mate choice. We investigated whether or not female laboratory mice, Mus musculus domesticus, could discriminate between parasitized and non-parasitized males on the basis of odour. Female mice were given a choice between the urine and other odorous secretions of either a male mouse sub-clinically infected for five days with the naturally occurring, enteric, single host, protozoan parasite, Eimeria vermiformis, or an uninfected male. Females showed a marked preference for the odours of non-parasitized male mice over those of the parasitized males; as measured by number of investigations, time spent per investigation, and total investigation time of the odours in a choice situation. Female mice also displayed an overwhelming initial, or first choice, preference for the odours of the non-parasitized male mice over those of the parasitized males. These observations show that female mice can distinguish between the odours of parasitized and non-parasitized males, and discriminate against parasitized males on the basis of odour. We suggest that the detection and avoidance of infected males by female mice through odour cues may function to reduce parasite transmission and potentially serve as a component of female mate selection or choice.

TI EVOLUTION AND PHYLOGENY OF WOLBACHIA - REPRODUCTIVE PARASITES OF
   ARTHROPODS
AB Wolbachia are cytoplasmically inherited bacteria found in reproductive tissues of many arthropod species. These bacteria are associated with reproductive alterations in their hosts, including parthenogenesis, reproductive incompatibility and feminization. A fine-scale phylogenetic analysis was done using DNA sequences from ftsZ, a rapidly evolving bacterial cell-cycle gene. ftsZ sequences were determined for 38 different Wolbachia strains from 31 different species of insects and one isopod. The following results were found: (i) there are two major division of Wolbachia (A and B) which diverged 58-67 millions years before present based upon synonymous substitution rates; (ii) a general concordance is found between the ftsZ and 16S rDNA phylogenies, indicating that these represent bacterial strain (rather than simply gene) phylogenies; however, a possible example of recombination between A and B division bacteria may have occurred in the feminizing- Wolbachia present in an isopod; (iii) extensive horizontal transmission of Wolbachia has occurred between insect taxa, including different insect orders; one strain in particular (designated Adm) shows extensive recent horizontal transmission; (iv) there is an association between the Wolbachia found in a parasitic wasp (Nasonia) and its fly host (Protocalliphora), suggesting exchange of bacteria between these species; (v) parthenogenesis induction has evolved several times among the Wolbachia; and (vi) some insects harbour infections with more than one Wolbachia strain, even within individual insects.

AB To investigate the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among injecting drug users, the authors assessed the prevalence of HBV seromarkers among 2,558 injecting drug users recruited through street outreach in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1988-1989. Eighty percent of the drug users had at least one HBV seromarker. HBV seropositivity was associated with increasing age, duration of injecting drug use, African-American ethnicity, injecting drugs at least once daily, and sharing needles or visiting ''shooting galleries'' during the previous 11 years, but not with high-risk sexual behaviors or a history of sexually transmitted disease, This finding is possibly due to the relative inefficiency of sexual transmission as compared with parenteral transmission in injecting drug users. In addition, HBV seropositivity was strongly associated with seropositivity for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. The authors conclude that HBV transmission among injecting drug users occurs primarily through the sharing of contaminated drug injecting equipment rather than through sexual relations, and that efforts to prevent HBV infection must: target injecting drug users early in their injecting careers.

TI TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF PUUMALA VIRUS-ANTIBODY PREVALENCE IN VOLES AND OF
   NEPHROPATHIA-EPIDEMICA INCIDENCE IN HUMANS
AB Puumala (PUU) virus is the etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans. This disease is highly endemic in Vasterbotten county, Sweden, with an annual incidence of 19.2 (range 3.7-37.4) per 100,000 inhabitants. Voles are considered to be both the main reservoir and the vector of PUU virus. A total of 3,591 rodents (mainly Clethrionomys glareolus, C. rufocanus, and Microtus agrestis) trapped in Vasterbotten between 1979 and 1987 were tested for the presence of PUU virus antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The predominant species, C. glareolus (71% [2,544 of 3,591]), also had the highest antibody prevalence (19% [483 of 2,544]). In C. glareolus, the antibody prevalence rate increased with weight (age), reaching more than 50% in the heaviest weight group, and suggesting that horizontal infection may be important. The highest frequency (25%) of antibody-positive C. rufocanus was also found in the highest weight groups. Microtus agrestis showed low absolute numbers and a low antibody prevalence rate (5%). In C. glareolus, both antibody prevalence and weight were recurrently higher in the spring than in the previous fall. The antibody prevalence rate in spring was positively correlated with the vole density in the previous fall and spring. The fall antibody prevalence rate was directly dependent on C. glareolus density. The incidence of human NE in the fall was dependent on the concurrent density of C. glareolus, whereas the incidence of NE in the spring was dependent on vole density the previous fall.

   SCHISTOSOMA-MANSONI
AB Schistosoma mansoni was first reported in the area of Richard Toll (Senegal) in 1988 and spread rapidly in the community, after a series of human-engineered ecologic changes. A random population sample (n = 422) from Ndombo, a village near Richard-Toll, was studied in 1991 by stool examination (four Kato slides from two stool samples) and antigen detection in urine and blood. Stool-positive individuals were treated with 40 mg/kg of praziquantel. A house-to-house interview regarding side effects was conducted 24 hr after treatment. Two hundred ninety-eight subjects were re-examined IO days (antigen detection) and 12 weeks (egg counts, antigen detection) after treatment. Before treatment, positive egg counts were found in 98% of the subjects, with 41% excreting more than 1,000 eggs per gram (epg) of feces. Treatment of 352 individuals caused serious but transient side effects (colic, vomiting, urticaria, and edema), the frequency of which increased with increasing egg counts. The parasitologic cure rate 12 weeks after treatment was only 18%, the frequency of egg counts with more than 1,000 epg decreased to 5%, and the mean egg count of those remaining positive was reduced by 86%. Antigen detection in serum 10 days and 12 weeks after treatment remained positive in 90% of the subjects; although titers decreased sharply. The low cure rates may be due to intense transmission and/or undeveloped immune responses in this recently exposed population. However, reduced drug susceptibility of the parasite strain has now been confirmed in one local isolate.

   LEISHMANIASIS, TOXOPLASMOSIS, AND CHAGAS-DISEASE AND ANTIGENS OF THE
   BLOOD-STAGE FORMS OF PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM DETERMINED BY INDIRECT
   IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE
AB Seroepidemiologic studies using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) are valuable in malaria control programs in identifying local foci of malaria, in diagnosing malaria in asymptomatic, low-parasitemia blood donors in nonendemic countries, in detecting imported malaria and preventing its introduction into new areas, and in excluding recurrent fever from causes other than malaria. Because other diseases may occur in areas where malaria is prevalent, the aim of this work, using the IFAT, was to determine the frequency of cross-reactions between blood-stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum and antibodies present in the serum of individuals with leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis and Chagas' disease: Since malaria transmission does not occur in the study area (State of Minas Gerais, Brazil) where these other diseases are present, we studied sera from individuals living in this area who had never been in the areas endemic for malaria in the Amazon region. Positive reactivity of sera with blood malaria antigens evaluated by IFAT at dilutions greater than or equal to 1:40 was detected in 19 (38%) of 50 individuals with cutaneous leishmaniasis, five (62%) of eight individuals with visceral leishmaniasis, 14 (32%) of 44 individuals with Chagas' disease, four (11%) of 36 individuals with toxoplasmosis, and in none of the 14 uninfected controls. All 23 of the control malaria sera from the endemic area (State of Mate Grosso, Brazil) were positive at high dilutions. We found no correlation between titers of the IFAT with malaria and the specific antigens used for serodiagnosis of the other protozoan infections studied. At dilutions of 1:20 and 1:40, the sensitivity of the IFAT test was 100% and specificity was 52% and 72%, respectively. At a dilution of 1:80, the sensitivity was 86% and the specificity was 90%. Thus, the choice of the final dilution of serum for use for the diagnosis of malaria should take into account the study population and the type of parasites prevalent in the area. At the present time, leishmaniasis is endemic in many areas of the Amazon region where malaria is endemic. Thus, we recommend the use of sera diluted greater than or equal to I:XO to exclude cross-reactive antibodies to this parasite in seroepidemiologic studies of malaria.

TI EFFECT OF ECTOPARASITIC MITES ON SEXUAL SELECTION IN A SONORAN DESERT
   FRUIT-FLY
AB We conducted a field study and a laboratory experiment to test whether ectoparasitic miles, Macrocheles subbadius, generate parasite-mediated sexual selection in the Sonoran desert endemic fruit fly, Drosophila nigrospiracula. Male flies gather on the outer surfaces of necrotic saguaro cacti where they engage in male-male competitive interactions and vigorous female-directed courtship. At these sites, operational sex ratios were significantly skewed toward males. The degree to which mites were aggregated among flies varied across the 25 fly populations sampled. The degree of mite aggregation across fly populations was strongly positively related to the mean number of mites per fly (intensity of infestation). Both the intensity and prevalence of infestation (fraction of flies infested) increased with the age of the cactus necrosis. Infested flies of both sexes were significantly less likely to be found in copula than uninfested flies, and mean intensity of infestation was significantly more pronounced in noncopulating than in copulating flies. The effect of attached mites on copulatory success exhibited dose-dependency, and this effect was more stringent in males: males or females with more than two and four mites, respectively, were never found in copula. The magnitude of parasite-mediated sexual selection was estimated for 12 fly populations by calculating selection differentials for each sex separately. The relation between intensity of infestation and magnitude of parasite-mediated sexual selection was stronger in males but significant for both sexes. We also assayed copulatory success of field-caught males in the laboratory, both during infestation and after experimental removal of mites. Males infested with two mites copulated less frequently than uninfested individuals, and in mating trials after mites had been removed, previously infested males copulated as many times as flies with no history of infestation. These findings, and the lack of difference in the number of mite-induced scars on copulating and single individuals in nature, strongly suggest that the reduced copulatory success of infested flies is attributable to an effect of mites per se, rather than to a character correlated with parasitism or previous parasite infestation.

TI HOST POPULATION-STRUCTURE AND THE EVOLUTION OF VIRULENCE - A
   LAW-OF-DIMINISHING-RETURNS
AB Structure in a population of host individuals, whether spatial or temporal, can have important effects on the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of its pathogens. One of these is to limit dispersal of pathogens and thus increase the amount of contact between a given pair or within a small group of host individuals. We introduce a ''law of diminishing returns'' that predicts an evolutionary decline of pathogen virulence whenever there are on average more possibilities of pathogen transmission between the same pair of hosts. Thus, the effect of repeated contact between hosts will be to shift the balance of any trade-off between virulence and transmissibility toward lower virulence.

TI RETARDATION OF BREEDING ONSET IN GREAT TITS (PARUS-MAJOR) BY BLOOD
   PARASITES
AB 1. Timing of breeding is one of the most important factors for reproductive success in birds and the nutritional state of the female seems to affect breeding time directly.
   2. Protozoan blood parasites consume a variety of host metabolites as well as haemoglobin. If blood parasites affect the nutritional state of females, parasite-free individuals will breed earlier than parasitized individuals.
   3. Effect of blood parasites on breeding time of Great Tits (Parus major L.) was studied for a population of tits nesting in boxes on the island of Gotland, Sweden.
   4. There was a significant negative relationship between infection of blood parasites and timing of breeding in females but not in males. Females with blood parasites initiated egg-laying and hatched their eggs later than uninfected females, after controlling for effects of female age on these variables.
   5. We suggest that parasites may compete for energy with the host resulting in a retarded initiation of laying.
   6. Because laying date and hatching date have been demonstrated to affect juvenile survival, and because parasites in the present study have been shown to affect laying and clutch hatching date, parasites consequently may reduce individual fitness of birds in this population of Great Tits.

TI VIRUS BURDEN IN LONG-TERM SURVIVORS OF HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS
   (HIV) INFECTION IS A DETERMINANT OF ANTI-HIV CD8(+) LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVITY
AB Persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for >8 years were studied to delineate virologic and immunologic attributes of long-term survival. Whereas those with 300-700 CD4(+) cells/mu L often had circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against HIV antigens, those with >1000 CD4(+) cells/mu L did not. The subjects with >1000 CD4(+) cells/mu L had low virus burden, low levels of Gag-specific CTL precursors, and minimal CD8(+) cell activation. Overall, elevated levels of CD8(+) cells, CD38 antigen expression on CD8(+) cells, and anti-HIV functions were correlated with increased virus burden, provirus load, and HIV plasma RNA levels. A factor that suppressed HIV replication was spontaneously secreted from CD8(+) cells of most subjects but not from those with high CD4(+) cell counts. CD8(+) cell activities, therefore, may reflect chronic viral stimulation of the immune system. Long-term survivors with high levels of CD4(+) cells maintained control of viral replication but lacked the CD8(+) cell activities.

TI PATTERNS OF COVERT INFECTION BY INVERTEBRATE PATHOGENS - IRIDESCENT
   VIRUSES OF BLACKFLIES
AB Recently, it has been recognized that blackfly populations may host two forms of infection by iridescent viruses (IVs); a covert (inapparent, nonlethal) form which was common in springtime populations in the River Ystwyth, Wales, and a patent (obvious, lethal) form which was rare. This study aimed to investigate the changes in frequency of the two types of infection in blackfly populations over the reproductive period of the flies, April-September 1992. Blackfly larvae sampled from three different sites along the river were bioassayed for the presence of covert IV infection. Of 870 larvae assayed, 17 were found to be infected. All the infected larvae appeared to be Simulium variegatum, the dominant species during the sampling period. IV infections were common in the spring (17-37% depending on site) but appeared absent in the S. variegatum population for most of the summer months, reappearing again in the autumn (0-20% infected). These fluctuations were concurrent with biotic and abiotic factors: elevated levels of covert infection occurred at low population densities, high water flow rates, low temperatures (and presumably slower growth rates), although it is not clear if any cause-and-effect relationship exists. Patent infections occurred immediately after the peak of covert infection in the spring, and again in the autumn. Virus characterization of isolates from covertly infected larvae showed that three distinct groups of isolates were present in the blackfly population. Isolates from the springtime populations were mostly variants of an isolate found in patently infected blackfly larvae in the 1970s (Aberystwyth IV). Isolates from the autumn populations were mostly variants of an isolate from a patently infected larva found in September the previous year. A third group comprised a single novel isolate which was detected in a covertly infected larva. The mechanisms by which IVs persist in blackfly populations remain unknown, although the role of alternative hosts is a possibility which needs to be studied.

TI POTENTIAL IMPACT OF LOW EFFICACY HIV-1 VACCINES IN POPULATIONS WITH
   HIGH-RATES OF INFECTION
AB A safe and effective HIV vaccine to prevent infection and/or to moderate disease is urgently needed. Research progress has been slower than anticipated for a variety of reasons including uncertainty over which immunogen to use (i.e.; recombinant subunit envelope proteins or whole HIV-1 products), confusion an which immunological markers best correlate with protection, the relevance of the HIV-I chimpanzee model to infection in humans and the significance of the rapid evolution of HIV-1, with different clades of the virus emerging in different parts of the world. However, what some would interpret as encouraging results, from Phase I and II trials of recombinant envelope glycoprotein vaccines, have raised the question of whether the time is right to start Phase III trials in humans with immunogens that may have low to moderate efficacy. By using mathematical models and data from epidemiological studies, we examine the potential impact of such vaccines within heterosexual communities with high rates of infection. Analyses suggest that it will be difficult to block HIV-1 transmission even with very high levels of mass vaccination. The cost of sustaining high levels of herd immunity with a vaccine of short protection duration is likely to be high. However, assessments of impact over the long duration of an HIV-1 epidemic indicate that many cases of HIV infection and associated mortality can be prevented by immunogens with efficacy of 50% or less and a five year protection duration. These analyses add some support to the view that proceeding with Phase III efficacy trials may be appropriate in high HIV transmission regions even if the consensus opinion on potential efficacy of the immunogen is that it will be low.

TI COINFECTION AND THE EVOLUTION OF PARASITE VIRULENCE
AB Analyses of the selection pressures acting on parasite virulence are made more complicated when individual hosts can simultaneously harbour many different strains or genotypes of a parasite. Here we explore the evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite associations in which individual hosts can be coinfected with many different parasite strains. (We take coinfection to mean that each strain transmits at a rate unaffected by the presence of others in the same host.) This study thus represents the opposite extreme to our earlier work on superinfection in which there is a dominance hierarchy such that only the most virulent strain present in a host is transmitted. For highly diverse populations of parasite strains, we find that such coinfection leads to selection for strains whose virulence-levels lie in a relatively narrowband close to the maximum consistent with the parasite's basic preproductive ratio, R-0, exceeding unity.

TI INTERMITTENCY AND TRANSIENT CHAOS FROM SIMPLE FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT
   SELECTION
AB Frequency-dependent selection is an important determinant of the evolution of gametophytic self-incompatibility systems in plants, aposematic (warning) and cryptic coloration, systems of mimicry, competitive interactions among members of a population, mating preferences, predator-prey and host-parasite interactions, aggression and other behavioural traits. Past theoretical studies of frequency-dependent selection have shown it to be a plausible mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variability in natural populations. Here, through an analysis of a simple deterministic model for frequency-dependent selection, we demonstrate that complex dynamic behaviour is possible under a broad range of parameter values. In particular we show that the model exhibits not only cycles and chaos but also, for a more restricted set of parameters, transient chaos and intermittency: alterations between an apparently deterministic behaviour and apparently chaotic fluctuations. This behaviour, which has not been stressed within the population genetics literature, provides an explanation for erratic dynamics of gene frequencies.

TI DISPERSAL AND DISEASE GRADIENTS OF ANTHER-SMUT INFECTION OF SILENE ALBA
   AT DIFFERENT LIFE STAGES
AB Given the increased recognition of the importance of spatial aggregation of infected individuals on disease spread, we used a held experiment to examine spore dispersal and disease transmission at increasing distances from an inoculum source in a well-studied system, the herbaceous plant Silene alba, infected by the anther-smut fungus Ustilago violacea. Two different life stages (vegetative and floral) were examined. We measured spore deposition on flowers and, as an analog of dispersal to vegetative plants, in small vials on the ground. Spore and disease gradients (number of spores or proportion of plants infected as a function of distance) were best fit with the classic power law, Y = aD(-b). The slope parameter, b, was similar for spore dispersal gradients of vegetative (b = -2.38) and flowering plants (b = -1.91), However, at every distance measured, the proportion of flowers with spores was higher than the proportion of ground vials with spores, indicating overall higher relative spore dispersal to flowering plants. We also determined that disease gradients for flowering plants were more shallow (b = -0.07) than spore dispersal gradients, and vegetative infection was more spatially restricted than floral infection (no infection beyond 3.2 m for vegetative plants while floral infection was detected up to 11.2 m). The relationship between spore dispersal and disease incidence was linear for vegetative plants and curvilinear for flowering plants, with limiting returns on disease after a low threshold number of spores deposited, Overall, our study suggests that the limited dispersal of spores is likely to be important in the aggregation of diseased plants in nature; such aggregation of inoculum in turn can increase or decrease disease spread depending on how much inoculum is needed to cause infection.

This increase was positively correlated with duration of infection (r = .74, P = .009), These data demonstrate perturbation of regulatory cells of the immune system in HTLV-I-infected children.

TI DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS IN MALARIA - HOST HETEROGENEITY MEETS PARASITE
   POLYMORPHISM
AB The spectrum of disease severity in Plasmodium falciparum malaria can be attributed to heterogeneity in parasite virulence or to heterogeneity in host factors. However, the two are not neccessarily separate explanations for the same phenomena: they may actually complement each other. The conjoint effects of host and parasite heterogeneity can serve to explain certain intriguing epidemiological observations, such as, why there is a reduction in incidence of severe malaria in certain host genotypes without a concomitant reduction in mild disease. By assuming that severe disease is caused by a rare independently transmitted parasite strain, and that the probability of disease is nonlinearly related to the number of effective infections by a certain strain, the disproportionate reduction in the rate of the rarer disease within resistant host genotypes may be explained. Conversely, heterogeneity in host resistance may, under certain circumstances, facilitate the maintenance of diversity in parasite virulence. In this paper we discuss the coevolutionary consequences of heterogeneity in host resistance and diversity in parasite virulence by using a simple mathematical model that attempts to integrate the population genetics of the system with its ecological dynamics. This allows a unified perspective on malaria transmission that synthesises current evidence regarding the effects of host and parasite heterogeneities on malarial disease.

TI USE OF MULTIPLE REPORTING SOURCES FOR PERINATAL HEPATITIS-B SURVEILLANCE
   AND FOLLOW-UP
AB The New York State Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program was implemented in New York State (excluding New York City) as a surveillance and control program in 1988, This report describes and evaluates the program and provides data from 1991 regarding hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers and their infants' subsequent hepatitis B vaccination. The program was created using multiple existing surveillance and data collection systems. Completeness of case-ascertainment was estimated by means of the Chandra Sekar-Deming method (J Am Stat Assoc 1949;44:101-15). An audit of hospital medical records and follow-up by local health departments were used to validate reporting accuracy, Of 158,273 live births in 1991, 363 (0.2%) were born to confirmed HBsAg-positive mothers. Estimated completeness of case-ascertainment was 96%, Thirty-five percent of HBsAg-positive mothers did not report risk factors for hepatitis B, confirming the need for universal testing, Of the infants, 83% received hepatitis B immune globulin and three doses of vaccine within one year of birth. By using existing data collection systems, the program was established quickly, and start-up funding and training requirements were simplified, Multiple reporting increased case-ascertainment to almost 100%, The program effectively identifies and ensures prompt vaccination of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.

TI POLIOMYELITIS IN THE NETHERLANDS - A REVIEW OF POPULATION IMMUNITY AND
   EXPOSURE BETWEEN THE EPIDEMICS IN 1978 AND 1992
AB An overview of serological and virological studies on poliomyelitis in the Netherlands between two epidemics in 1978 and 1992 is given. Three unvaccinated patients acquired poliomyelitis abroad. In the Netherlands vaccination coverage with quadruple DPT-IPV vaccine is very high. The strong immunogenicity of inactivated poliovirus vaccine was confirmed in a cohort of children, reflected in age-stratified antibody profiles of the population. Adults born in the pre vaccination era appeared in general protected, but 10-25% of persons born between 1930 and 1945 lacked neutralizing antibodies. Revaccination induced a booster type of antibody response in 75-90% of such persons, indicating immunological memory and protection.
   Virological studies on adopted children from other countries, patients with indications for viral examination, and river waters showed that the Netherlands was regularly exposed to polio virus (PV), without signs of indigenous transmission. Persons found to carry PV or their close contacts had travelled to a PV endemic country. Most of 557 isolates were vaccine-derived, only 8% were wild type viruses. Despite their presence, up to 1992 the well-known susceptibles for PV in the Netherlands were shielded by the herd immunity of the Dutch population.

   IN NOD/LTSZ-SCID/SCID MICE
AB Inbred C.B-17-scid/scid mice accept human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) xenografts and are susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, but low levels of PBMC engraftment impede use of this system in HIV research, This report describes the effect of host strain background on human PBMC engraftment and HIV infectivity in scid mice. Backcrossing the scid mutation to the NOD/Lt strain (designated NOD/LtSz-scid/scid) increased the percentage of engrafted human PBMC in recipient spleens by 5- to 10-fold compared with that in C.B-17-scid/scid stock. Four weeks after human PBMC-injected mice were infected with HIV-1, 79% of NOD/LtSz-scid/scid spleens harbored replicating virus compared with only 39% of spleens in C.B-17-scid/scid mice. The NOD/LtSz-scid/scid mouse may provide a useful small animal model for studies of HIV-1.

TI A SIMULATION-MODEL OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF URBAN DENGUE FEVER -
   LITERATURE ANALYSIS, MODEL DEVELOPMENT, PRELIMINARY VALIDATION, AND
   SAMPLES OF SIMULATION RESULTS
AB We have developed a pair of stochastic simulation models that describe the daily dynamics of dengue virus transmission in the urban environment. Our goal has been to construct comprehensive models that take into account the majority of factors known to influence dengue epidemiology. The models have an orientation toward site-specific data and are designed to be used by operational programs as well as researchers. The first model, the container-inhabiting mosquito simulation model (CIMSiM), a weather-driven dynamic Life-table model of container-inhabiting mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti, provides inputs to the transmission model, the dengue simulation model (DENSiM); a description and validation of the entomology model was published previously. The basis of the transmission model is the simulation of a human population growing in response to country- and age-specific birth and death rates. An accounting of individual serologies is maintained by type of dengue virus, reflecting infection and birth to seropositive mothers. Daily estimates of adult mosquito survival, gonotrophic development, and the weight and number of emerging females from the CIMSiM are used to create the biting mosquito population in the DENSiM. The survival and emergence values determine the size of the population while the rate of gonotrophic development and female weight estimates influence biting frequency. Temperature and titer of virus in the human influences the extrinsic incubation period; titer may also influence the probability of transfer of virus from human to mosquito. The infection model within the DENSiM accounts for the development of virus within individuals and its passage between both populations. As in the case of the CIMSiM, the specific values used for any particular phenomenon are on menus where they can be readily changed. It is possible to simulate concurrent epidemics involving different serotypes. To provide a modicum of validation and to demonstrate the parameterization process for a specific location, we compare simulation results with reports on the nature of epidemics and seroprevalence of antibody in Honduras in low-lying coastal urbanizations and Tegucigalpa following the initial introduction of dengue-1 in 1978 into Central America. We conclude with some additional examples of simulation results to give an indication of the types of questions that can be investigated with the models.

TI SELECTION BY PARASITES ON COMPONENTS OF FITNESS IN TRIBOLIUM BEETLES -
   THE EFFECT OF INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION
AB In the past decade, parasites have been widely recognized by population biologists as important selective agents on host populations. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms of parasite-imposed selective processes. We examine the effects of the tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta, on the fitness of the flour beetle host, Tribolium castaneum, under high and low intraspecific competition environments. We further identify the components of fitness that contribute to the overall parasite-induced reduction of fitness. The fitness components studied include female fecundity, adult cannibalism of eggs, egg-to-adult viability, and male sperm precedence. Under high intraspecific competition, parasite infection significantly reduced the fitness of both male and female beetles; infected beetles showed increased adult cannibalism rate of eggs. Such a parasite-induced behavioral alteration may contribute to the observed reduction in net fecundity. In contrast, under low intraspecific competition, male fitness was not significantly changed, reductions in fecundity were not significant, and second-male sperm precedence was significantly decreased by the tapeworm infection. The egg-to-adult viability of eggs from infected beetles was not significantly changed in either environment. These results provide evidence that parasitism can affect host fitness through both fecundity and sexual selection, and they suggest that the consequences of parasite infection on host fitness and the components of fitness can be mediated by host density.

TI Overview: Viral agents and cancer
AB Substantial evidence indicates that several common viruses are clearly or probable causal factors in the etiology of specific malignancies. These viruses either normally establish latency or can become persistent infections. Oncogenesis is probably linked to an enhanced level of viral activation in the infected host, reflecting heavy viral dose or compromised immune control. The major virus-malignancy systems include hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatocellular carcinoma; human lymphotropic virus-type 1 (HTLV-1) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL); Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Hodgkin's disease; and human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer. Of these, a vaccine is available only for HBV. These malignancies tend to occur in early to mid-life and account for a substantial amount of morbidity and person-years lost. They are also likely to occur as "opportunistic malignancies" among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1, particularly among those who experience prolonged survival.

TI SYNCHRONY IN TETRAONID POPULATION-DYNAMICS
AB 1. We studied temporal and spatial synchrony of population fluctuations in the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) in Finland.
   2. The data consist of route censuses (20 000-30 000 km annually) performed in 11 provinces during 1964-83, The population data for the three species in each province were standardized to zero mean and unit variance.
   3. Cross-correlation analysis indicates that population dynamics of the three species in every area are in rather good temporal synchrony. Moreover, with the aid of k-means clustering, the 11 provinces could be merged into four regions, indicating large-scale synchrony in dynamics of the three tetraonid species.
   4. Because it is obvious that this synchrony cannot be due only to the similar life histories of these species, we explored whether it could be influenced by a common synchronizing factor affecting all the species simultaneously. In order to do this we used a Leslie matrix-based simulation approach. In this model there is a stochastic hit of breeding failure at a given average interval. This failure was shown to synchronize the population dynamics of the species with primarily different life tables.

TI Effects of maternal parasite load on offspring life-history traits in
   the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara)
AB We studied the effect of maternal ectoparasite load (measured at parturition) on the life-history traits of the offspring of the host Lacerta vivipara, the European common lizard. The ectoparasite, a mite belonging to the family Laelapidae, had a detrimental effect on its host: parasite load was associated with increased host mortality, and was negatively correlated with host body mass. Parasite load was persistent over time, suggesting that parasite load can be predictable. Offspring of highly parasitised mothers had higher values of several fitness components early in life than offspring of parasite-free mothers or lightly infested mothers. This was expressed in terms of increased F-1 yearling growth rate, and reproductive investment at first reproduction (measured as F-2 hatchling mass). These results are interpreted as a host adaptation to attenuate the impact of parasites. Indeed, if high parasite loads arise from long exposure time to a constant population of parasites, and if the negative effects of parasites are additive over time, hosts could reduce the impact of parasites simply by investing more during the earlier stages of life. Naturally, having better performance early in life should lead to higher mortality rates and/or lower fecundity later in life.

TI DETERMINING THE PREVALENCE OF ONCHOCERCA-VOLVULUS INFECTION IN VECTOR
   POPULATIONS BY POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION SCREENING OF POOLS OF BLACK
   FLIES
AB An important variable in the epidemiology of arthropodborne diseases is the intensity of transmission, which is a function of host-vector contact and the prevalence of infection in the vector population. This latter value is often difficult to estimate. It is possible to envision the application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to this problem. To accomplish this, the assay must detect a single infected vector in a pool containing a large number of uninfected individuals. It must also be possible to calculate the prevalence of infection from the number of positive peels. A PCR assay for detecting Onchocerca volvulus in pools of vector black flies is described, and an algorithm is presented to calculate the prevalence of infection in the vector population, based upon the proportion of PCR-positive pools. This algorithm should be applicable to any disease for which a PCR assay is available.

TI Understanding productivity, a key to Aedes aegypti surveillance
AB The objective of this work was to define criteria that could be applied to achieve faster, more economical, and accurate assessment of vector populations for control of dengue viruses. During 1989-1990, 1,349 premises were surveyed in Townsville, Charters Towers and Mingela/Ravenswood, Queensland, Australia. In each locality, 1.9-8.4% of premises contained three or more containers with Aedes aegypti immature forms and were designated as key premises. Comparison of surveys in Townsville from 1989 to 1990 indicated that positive premises (i.e., those with at least one container with Ae. aegypti present) were 3.22 times more likely to remain positive than negative houses to become positive the following year. The Ae. aegypti population in Townsville was seen to be totally associated with garden receptacles, discarded household items, and trash but one well and one rainwater tank were responsible for 28% of all immature forms recorded in the 1,349 premises inspected. These breeding sites of high productivity were designated as key containers. At Charters Towers, Mingela, and Ravenswood, rainwater tanks were seen as the most important key container because although they constituted 13-29% of positive containers, they supported 60-63% of the immature forms. This study demonstrates that there is a certain degree of stability with regard to positive premises and that some of these, or some container types, contribute disproportionately to the Ae. aegypti population. Control programs could be made more efficient if efforts were concentrated on these sites of key vector productivity.

TI The dynamics of multiple infection and the evolution of virulence
AB While for pathogen clones singly occupying a host it may pay to adopt a relatively avirulent host exploitation strategy, clones sharing a host have a conflict of interest that favors more virulent strategies. As the number of infections per host depends on the force of infection and the force of infection, in turn, depends on prevailing virulence, evolutionary analysis needs to be integrated with population dynamics. A full-fledged approach requires exceedingly large capacities for bookkeeping of the infection events and is therefore difficult to establish. In this article the host-pathogen interaction is studied for the simple case in which hosts may become at most doubly infected. It appears that evolution and population dynamics give rise to a feedback mechanism. When double infections are frequent, increased virulence is favored; but when pathogens become more virulent, the force of infection will decrease, favoring lower virulence again. Thus, evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) virulence depends on the interaction within hosts as well as on the interaction at the population level. As current models of host-microparasite interactions take only first infections into account, they may be inappropriate for evolutionary analyses, which would require modeling of within-host competition between strains and thus of multiple infections.

TI Parasite-induced gigantism in a snail: A host adaptation?
AB 1. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that parasite-induced gigantism in molluscs may be a host adaptation by increasing a host's probability of outliving an infection.
   2. I exposed juvenile pulmonate snails from two populations of the hermaphrodite Lymnaea peregra to infections with the trematode Diplostomum phoxini. Only one of the two snail populations studied is naturally in contact with this parasite (P+) and the other is not (P-).
   3. Diplostomum phoxini induced gigantism only in P+ snails. Furthermore, P+ snails showed a lower parasite-induced mortality compared to P- snails but infected P+ snails did not lay eggs before they died.
   4. These results are in agreement with three out of four predictions derived from the hypothesis of gigantism as a host adaptation. The fourth prediction, that some P+ snails should survive long enough to outlive the infection and reproduce, was not met.
   5. My results do not directly support the idea that parasite-induced gigantism is of adaptive value for L. peregra but suggest that gigantism is unlikely to be purely a parasite adaptation. This study cannot exclude the alternative hypothesis that gigantism is a non-adaptive side-effect of infection.

TI TOXOPLASMA-GONDII COMPRISES 3 CLONAL LINEAGES - CORRELATION OF PARASITE
   GENOTYPE WITH HUMAN-DISEASE
AB The population genetic structure of Toxoplasma gondii was determined by multilocus restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis at 6 loci in 106 independent isolates from humans and animals, Phylogenetic and statistical analyses indicated a highly unusual population structure consisting of 3 widespread clonal lineages. Extensively mixed genotypes were only apparent in 4 strains, which indicated that, while not separate species, sexual recombination between the 3 lineages is exceedingly rare in natural populations, T. gondii is a major cause of subclinical human infection and an important opportunistic pathogen that causes severe disease in immunocompromised patients. While strains from all 3 lineages were isolated from humans, the majority of human toxoplasmosis cases were associated with strains of a type II genotype. The correlation of specific clonal lineages with human toxoplasmosis has important implications for development of vaccines, drug treatments, and diagnostic protocols.

TI Ectoparasites reduce long-term survival of their avian host
AB Few field studies have evaluated whether ectoparasites affect the long-term survival of their adult host, although many studies have examined the impact of parasites on the host's offspring. In the colonially nesting cliff swallow (Hirundo pyrrhonota), we manipulated ectoparasite load (of cimicid bugs, fleas, and chewing lice) by fumigating adults and comparing annual survivorship of fumigated birds and non-fumigated control birds captured at the same time. Mark-recapture experiments over an 8-year period revealed that non-fumigated birds had an annual survivorship about 12% less than chat of fumigated birds, on average, but the effects did not vary with colony size. Based on the difference in survivorship between fumigated and non-fumigated birds, we estimated that parasitized individuals had an annual survivorship of 0.38, compared with 0.57 for non-parasitized birds. The parasite-caused reduction in survivorship was the equivalent of the host losing up to one year of lifetime reproductive success. Ectoparasites did not preferentially infest hosts of lower quality, suggesting that all birds in the population were at potential risk of suffering parasitism and the resulting reductions in survivorship. Our results show that obligate ectoparasites such as fleas and lice impose a substantial long-term cost to their hosts and suggest that future studies of ectoparasitism should consider the parasites' effect on annual survival of adult hosts.

TI Rapid turnover of Plasmodium falciparum populations in asymptomatic
   individuals living in a high transmission area
AB A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) typing technique, based on the amplification of polymorphic regions from the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) and MSP-2 Plasmodium falciparum genes, was used to characterize parasites collected in a longitudinal study of asymptomatic carriers of malaria parasites living in two distinct epidemiologic situations. Blood samples were collected from children and adults living in the village of Dielmo, Senegal, when malaria transmission was 3-6 infective bites/week/individual. For each individual, every sample collected at two-week intervals over a period of three months showed a specific PCR pattern. Changes involved both appearance and disappearance of specific alleles. Analysis of blood samples collected at a few-days interval showed that modifications of the PCR patterns occurred rapidly. Most alleles were detected over a period of 2-3 weeks, but some alleles could be detected only for a few days. The frequent modifications of the PCR patterns indicate significant changes in allelic balance over time, and importantly, this was observed both in children and adults. These results strongly contrast with the stability of the parasite types harbored by asymptomatic individuals living in Pikine, Senegal during a period in which malaria transmission was interrupted, and therefore suggest that the rapid turnover observed in Dielmo may reflect the introduction of new parasite populations by mosquitoes.

AB Onchocerca volvulus and O. lienalis skin-derived microfilariae (mf) were cultured in vitro; parasite viability was assessed at intervals by measuring their ability to develop in Simulium ornatum. In the presence of monkey kidney feeder cells, both species retained full viability when cultured for up to 5 hr before intrathoracic injection into Simulium. In the absence of feeder cells and in contrast to O. lienalis, O. volvulus mf rapidly lost their viability. In further trials (including feeder cells), O. volvulus mf retained full viability for 14 days, while O. lienalis mf retained full viability for at least 19 days but with a proportion able to develop to third-stage larvae (L3) after 70 days in culture. In experiments using this system to culture O. volvulus mf (ex utero) derived from adult female worms but with the addition of reduced glutathione and/or 20-hydroxyecdysone, parasites were consistently more active over a 70-day period than those cultured without these additives. None of the mf cultured without additives were able to develop to L3 in Simulium when tested for up to 51 days in culture, while a proportion of mf incubated with reduced glutathione and/or 20-hydroxyecdysone produced small but significant numbers of L3 after 28, 43, and 51 days, representing the first time that uterine mf have been cultured to a form infective for the vector.

TI Objectives and methodology in a study of malaria treatment and
   prevention in pregnancy in rural Malawi: The Mangochi Malaria Research
   Project
AB Malaria infection due to Plasmodium falciparum has been widely recognized as associated with important adverse consequences in pregnant women, particularly in areas of high transmission. Although strategies using antimalarial drugs for prevention had been recommended, even by the late 1980s, few studies had been carried out to examine the efficacy of these prevention efforts. The objectives of the Mangochi Malaria Research Project investigation were to determine the comparative efficacy of regimens containing chloroquine (CQ) or mefloquine (MQ) antimalarial treatment and chemoprophylaxis in an area of CQ-resistant P. falciparum on the following outcomes: 1) the frequency of placental malaria infection; 2) the frequency of low birth weight; 3) the frequency of prematurity or intrauterine growth retardation; 4) the frequency of maternal fever illness and severe anemia; and 5) the likelihood of infant acquisition of malaria infection. Although the investigation was not designed to evaluate the role of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis and treatment on infant mortality reduction, because babies born to study women were scheduled to be followed for up to two years of life, the study allowed for an examination of mortality and morbidity in this population. The sample size was insufficient to provide more than descriptive analysis of mortality and morbidity in the fetal, perinatal, neonatal, postneonatal, and infant time intervals. The study design allowed for the evaluation of two additional aspects of maternal and infant health: other determinants of the above-listed outcomes in addition to malaria prevention (e.g., maternal age, gravidity, socioeconomic status, infection with human immunodeficiency virus or syphilis) and reported cause-specific mortality in the fetal-to-infant intervals. The study design included 22 months of enrollment of pregnant women at their first antenatal clinic visit from four clinic sites in Mangochi District, Malawi, with assignment to one of four antimalarial regimens and prospective follow-up through pregnancy, at delivery, and during infancy. All drug dosing was performed under supervision by the study team, making this an evaluation of intervention efficacy (excluding the role of patient compliance).

TI Developing effective strategies for malaria prevention programs for
   pregnant African women
AB The control of malaria in pregnant African women, one of several child survival strategies applied through antenatal care, has been particularly challenging. Prevention and control recommendations for typical areas of high Plasmodium falciparum transmission have promoted the use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis to prevent placental infection. Persistently low program coverage coupled with diminishing intervention effectiveness have forced a re-evaluation of the relative importance of malaria in pregnancy. The Mangochi Malaria Research Project (MMRP), a prospective evaluation of malaria prevention in pregnant women in rural Malawi conducted during 1987-1990, contributed to establishing new criteria for policy and program development for malaria prevention in pregnancy. The principle findings of the MMRP include: 1) populations at risk of the adverse consequences of malaria in pregnancy include women with low parity, women infected with human immunodeficiency virus, pregnancy during the high malaria transmission season, and the use of a malaria drug that is suboptimally efficacious; 2) the estimated maximum benefits of an antimalarial intervention that clears placental and umbilical cord parasitemia are a 5-12% reduction of low birth weight (LBW), an approximately 35% reduction in the risk of LBW for risks that are actually preventable once a woman has become pregnant (e.g., risks such as infectious disease or poor nutrition during gestation), and a 3-5% reduction in the rate of infant mortality; 3) the intervention must be capable of rendering the woman malaria parasite free, including clearance of parasites from the placental vascular space and umbilical cord blood; 4) other diseases adversely affect pregnancy outcome and, while the control of malaria in pregnancy may not warrant independent programming, if coupled with prevention programs to provide a range of antenatal services, the incremental costs of malaria control may prove to be highly cost-effective; and 5) the choice of a regimen must balance intervention efficacy with safety, availability, affordability, and simplicity of delivery, and several antimalarials may meet these criteria. The Malawi Ministry of Health has modified its malaria prevention in pregnancy recommendations and now faces the challenge of effective programming to improve child survival.

TI Virus transmission in gypsy moths is not a simple mass action process
AB We used the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (LdNPV) of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), to test one of the basic assumptions of most models of disease dynamics, that the rate of horizontal transmission is directly proportional to the product of the densities of healthy larvae and virus. To do this we made measurements of virus transmission, using small-scale experiments in bags on red oak (Quercus rubra) foliage and field data on naturally occurring populations from a previous study. We observed a decline in the transmission constant as the densities of both healthy larvae and pathogen increased, indicating that the rate of disease transmission is not directly proportional to the product of these variables.

TI Molecular population genetic analysis of emerged bacterial pathogens:
   Selected insights
AB Research in bacterial population genetics has increased in the last 10 years. Population genetic theory and tools and related strategies have been used to investigate bacterial pathogens that have contributed to recent episodes of temporal variation in disease frequency and severity. A common theme demonstrated by these analyses is that distinct bacterial clones are responsible for disease outbreaks and increases in infection frequency Many of these clones are characterized by unique combinations of virulence genes or alleles of virulence genes. Because substantial interclonal variance exists in relative virulence, molecular population genetic studies have]ed to the concept that the unit of bacterial pathogenicity is the done or cell line. Continued new insights into host-parasite interactions at the molecular level will be achieved by combining clonal analysis of bacterial pathogens with large-scale comparative sequencing of virulence genes.

   interpunctella: A test of the mass action assumption with an insect
   pathogen
AB Central to theoretical studies of host-pathogen population dynamics is a term describing transmission of the pathogen. This usually assumes that transmission is proportional to the density of infectious hosts or particles and of susceptible individuals. We tested this assumption with the bacterial pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis infecting larvae of Plodia interpunctella, the Indian meal moth. Transmission was found to increase in a more than linear way with host density in fourth and fifth instar P. interpunctella, and to decrease with the density of infectious cadavers in the case of fifth instar larvae. Food availability was shown to play an important part in this process. Therefore, on a number of counts, the usual assumption was found not to apply in our experimental system.

TI Clade selection, reversible evolution and the persistence of selfish
   elements: The evolutionary dynamics of cytoplasmic incompatibility
AB Every sexual species is potentially vulnerable to a wide range of heritable factors that disrupt the normal patterns of inheritance. Why these selfish elements are not more common is not well understood. Here, by reference to the dynamics of cytoplasmic incompatibility, we propose a novel solution, namely that under certain conditions, the most likely trajectory is for the selfish element to invade, followed by slow decay to complete loss. Cytoplasmic incompatibility is found in several arthropod species and is characterized by the fact that crosses between males infected with vertically transmitted bacteria of the genus Wolbachia and uninfected females produce significantly fewer adult progeny than the other mating combinations. Early models revealed that such bacteria are expected to spread very rapidly and persist at high frequencies. This being so, cytoplasmic incompatibility should be stably maintained through cladogenesis, thus most sub-populations within a species should be affected. Contrary to these expectations is the finding that cytoplasmic incompatibility within species is patchily distributed and rare. More recent analyses suggest that although Wolbachia should persist in populations the sterilizing effect may wane. We extend one of these analyses and find that through most parameter space, following the invasion of cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing Wolbachia into an uninfected population, not only will the sterilizing effect wane but the conditions become permissive for the spread of the uninfected cytotype. This system is then expected to proceed to fixation of uninfecteds at which point the population will have gone full circle (reversible evolution). This evolutionary trajectory is supported by mitochondrial haplotype/Wolbachia cytotype covariance in Drosophila melanogaster. Given that there is no evidence of intra-specific horizontal transmission and that the most robust equilibrium is fixation of uninfecteds, a further consequence is that one can deduce that clade selection most likely favoured Wolbachia's ability to undergo inter-specific transmission. This possibility is supported by comparison of inter-species horizontal transmission rates of mutualistic and deleterious symbionts. Reversible evolution may well be a property of many (but not all) selfish genetic elements.

TI Parasite-host coevolution and geographic patterns of parasite
   infectivity and host susceptibility
AB Ebert (1994) has proposed the rule that parasites are, with few exceptions, more infective to sympatric hosts than to allopatric hosts. We test this rule using field data for schistosome infections of planorbid snails and find that, although sympatric parasite-host combinations do tend to be more compatible, there are exceptions where particular allopatric parasite-host populations are significantly more compatible. We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of the parasite-host interaction where parasite infectivity and host susceptibility are defined by the matching of genotypes in a diploid system. The model predicts dynamic polymorphisms where parasite allele frequencies track host allele frequencies but with a lag. Because of this lag it is possible for allopatric combinations to be more compatible than sympatric combinations. Any 'rule' that precludes this possibility is unlikely to prove robust.

TI Occurrence of hantavirus within the rodent population of northeastern
   California and Nevada
AB These studies were initiated to determine the prevalence and hosts of hantaviruses within the rodent population of Nevada and northeastern California. A total of 1,867 rodents were collected, sexed, weighed, identified, and tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of antibody against hantavirus nucleocapsid. The primary hosts for hantaviruses in this region were found within the family Muridae (Peromyscus maniculatus, Reithrodontomys megalotis, and Microtus montanus). Studies over time of animals within a defined geographic area indicated that animals with hantavirus antibody are not distributed uniformly over the rodent population in a specific area but were found in foci spanning a distance of only several hundred meters. The antibody prevalence in a given geographic area remained relatively constant with repeated sampling of between 0% and 30%. These data support the hypothesis that rodents within the family Muridae are the primary reservoir for hantaviruses, and the primary risk to biologists for exposure to hantavirus is by contact with members of this family.

TI Bacterial population dynamics in three anopheline species: The impact on
   Plasmodium sporogonic development
AB The functional role of bacteria in the midgut of adult mosquitoes is unknown. In this study, we examined the population dynamics of midgut bacteria of laboratory reared Anopheles stephensi, An. gambiae, and An. albimanus. Mosquito midguts were dissected under sterile conditions and examined for the presence of bacteria using standard microbiologic techniques. Ninety percent and 73% (n = 30) of newly emerged An. gambiae and An. stephensi, respectively, harbored bacteria. In contrast, only 17% (n = 23) of An. albimanus harbored any bacteria. The bacterial population increased 11-40-fold in the presence of a blood meal, but then decreased to pre-blood meal levels in 3-5 days. Pseudomonas cepacia, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Flavobacterium spp. were found in all three anopheline species. Midgut bacteria were acquired both transtadially and through the sugar meal. Transtadial transmission was demonstrated by successfully passaging Escherichia coli HS5 from the larval to the adult stage. However, midgut bacteria were acquired more efficiently through the sugar meal than through transtadial passage. An increase in midgut bacterial counts after mosquitoes were exposed to a bacteria/sugar suspension significantly reduced oocyst infection rates and densities in Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquito cohorts. Since bacteria occur naturally in wild mosquitoes, it may be possible to modify anopheline vector competence using introduced or indigenous bacteria.

TI The midgut bacterial flora of wild Aedes triseriatus, Culex pipiens, and
   Psorophora columbiae mosquitoes
AB The midgut bacterial flora of wild-caught Aedes triseriatus, Culex pipiens, and Psorophora columbiae mosquitoes was investigated. Dissected midgut contents were examined using quantitative aerobic bacterial cultures. Individual colonies (n = 134) were subcultured and identified to species. Midgut bacterial counts changed dramatically during mosquito development. A 280-1,100-fold decrease in the bacterial population occurred between the larval stage and pupal emergence, whereas a subsequent 70-16,000-fold increase occurred after blood-feeding. Bacterial identifications revealed a complex flora with up to nine genera identified during any stage of development. Species most frequently isolated were Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella ozonae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter agglomerans. The presence of genetically well-characterized bacteria in the midgut flora of mosquitoes may provide a means of expressing novel genetic products in vector species.

TI The transmission dynamics of hepatitis B in the UK: A mathematical model
   for evaluating costs and effectiveness of immunization programmes
AB Complex hepatitis B (HBV) epidemiology makes it difficult to evaluate and compare effectiveness of different immunization policies. A method for doing so is presented using a mathematical model of HBV transmission dynamics which can represent universal infant and adolescent vaccination strategies and those targeted at genito-urinary (GU) clinic attenders and infants born to infectious mothers. Model structure, epidemiological underpinning, and parameterization, are described. Data from the UK National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles is used to define patterns of sexual activity and GU clinic attendance; data deficiencies are discussed, in particular that of UK seroprevalence of HBV markers stratified by age, sex, and risk factors. General model predictions of endemic HBV marker prevalence in homosexual and heterosexual populations seem consistent with published UK data. The simulations exhibit non-linearities in the impact of different vaccination strategies. Estimated number of carriers prevented per vaccine dose for each strategy provides a measure of costs and benefits, varying temporally over the course of a programme, and with level of vaccine coverage. Screening before vaccination markedly increases payback per dose in homosexuals but not in heterosexuals; mass infant vaccination gives the poorest effectiveness ratio and vaccination of infants after antenatal screening the best; in general, increasing vaccine coverage yields lower pay-back per dose. The model provides a useful framework for evaluating costs and benefits of immunization programmes, but for precise quantitative comparison more UK epidemiological data is urgently needed.

TI Nonrandom genotypic associations in a legume - Bradyrhizobium mutualism
AB Genetically divergent lineages often coexist within populations of the annual legume Amphicarpaea bracteata. At one site dominated by two such lineages (termed biotypes ''C'' and ''S''), isolates of root-nodule bacteria (Bradyrhizobium sp.) were sampled from both hosts and analyzed by enzyme electrophoresis. Symbiont populations on the two plant biotypes were highly distinct. Out of 15 bacterial multilocus genotypes detected (among 51 isolates analyzed),only one was shared in common by the two plant biotypes. Cluster analysis revealed three bacterial lineages (designated I, II, and III), with lineage I found exclusively on biotype C plants, and the two other lineages almost completely restricted to biotype S hosts. Laboratory inoculation tests indicated that lineage I bacteria were strictly specialized on biotype C hosts, forming few or no nodules on plants of the other host biotype. Bacterial lineages II and III were capable of forming nodules on both kinds of plants, but nodule numbers were often significantly higher on biotype S hosts. The nonrandom association between plant and bacterial lineages at this site implies that genetic diversity of hosts is an important factor in the maintenance of polymorphism within the symbiont population.

TI Limited polymorphism at major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci in
   the Swedish moose A-alces
AB The Swedish moose was analysed for genetic variability at major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II DQA, DQB and DRB loci using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) techniques. Both methods revealed limited amounts of polymorphism. Since the SSCP analysis concerned an expressed DRB gene it can be concluded that the level of functional MHC class II polymorphism at least at the DRB locus, is low in Swedish moose. DNA fingerprinting was used to determine if the unusual pattern of low MHC variability could be explained by a low degree of genome-wide genetic diversity. Hybridizations with two minisatellite probes gave similarity indices somewhat higher than the average for other natural population, but the data suggest that the low MHC variability cannot be explained by a recent population bottleneck. However, since minisatellite sequences evolve more rapidly than MHC sequences, the low levels of MHC diversity may be attributed to a bottleneck of more ancient origin. The selection pressure for MHC variability in moose may also be reduced and we discuss the possibility that its solitary life style may reduce lateral transmission of pathogens in the population.

TI Dissemination of the strA-strB streptomycin-resistance genes among
   commensal and pathogenic bacteria from humans, animals, and plants
AB Gene transfer within bacterial communities has been recognized as a major contributor in the recent evolution of antibiotic resistance on a global scale. The linked strA-strB genes, which encode streptomycin-inactivating enzymes, are distributed worldwide and confer streptomycin resistance in at least 17 genera of gram-negative bacteria. Nucleotide sequence analyses suggest that strA-strB have been recently disseminated. In bacterial isolates from humans and animals, strA-strB are often linked with the sulII sulfonamide-resistance gene and are encoded on broad-host-range nonconjugative plasmids. In bacterial isolates from plants, strA-strB are encoded on the Tn3-type transposon Tn5393 which is generally borne on conjugative plasmids. The wide distribution of the strA-strB genes in the environment suggests that gene transfer events between human, animal, and plant-associated bacteria have occurred. Although the usage of streptomycin in clinical medicine and animal husbandry has diminished, the persistence of strA-strB in bacterial populations implies that factors other than direct antibiotic selection are involved in maintenance of these genes.

TI An explicit genetic model for ecological character displacement
AB Realistic models for ecological character displacement should incorporate population genetics. In Slatkin's pioneering model (Slatkin 1980), the genetics of the quantitative character determining the competitive interactions are modeled by assuming that the character is normally distributed in each generation. Only the mean and the variance of the character distributions change over time. With symmetric ecological assumptions for the two competing species, and with normally distributed resources that are equally used by both species, this model did not yield significant displacement. This has led to the belief that ecological asymmetries or constraints on resource use, e.g., by constraining the phenotypic variances, are necessary for character displacement. I argue that the reason for the negative result in Slatkin's original model is that the genetics are modeled too rigidly. With a more flexible genetic model, obtained by explicitly modeling many loci with additive effects, character displacement occurs as a rule even for symmetric ecological assumptions and without constraints on the phenotype distributions. The model can also be used in other contexts than competition for resources. For example, character displacement in a host-parasite system can lead to parasite specialization. The results suggest that more detailed genetic models yield a finer resolution of the interaction between population genetics and ecological dynamics. Explicit genetics lead to more insights than the usual quantitative genetic assumption of normal character distribution.

TI Plant tolerance of gall-insect attack and gall-insect performance
AB We examined plant tolerance of gall-insect attack and gall-insect performance in rosinweed (Silphium integrifolium, Asteraceae) and its apical meristem galler Antistrophus silphii (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae). Gall densities were varied in field rosinweed populations, while gall densities, water, and nutrients were varied for rosinweed in an experimental garden. Field plants grew under prevailing resource and competitive conditions, but garden plants grew free from competition, so gall-insect impacts, rosinweed regrowth, and gall-insect performance were observed under widely different growing conditions. Seasonal measures of rosinweed growth and leaf physiology, and end-of-season measures of biomass, reproduction, gall-wasp emergence, growth, sex ratios, and parasitism were made for both experiments.
   Rosinweed poorly tolerated Antistrophus gall damage in the field. Galls reduced plant height, leaf area, and inflorescence production. Rosinweed diverted biomass to stems, but produced no regrowth from axillary meristems. In the garden, rosinweed was much more tolerant of Antistrophus gall damage. Galls initially reduced plant height and leaf area, but axillary meristems grew profusely after gall formation, producing nearly all galled plant inflorescences and more than replacing leaf area initially lost to gall formation. Water- and nutrient-supplemented rosinweed were most tolerant of gall damage, experiencing little loss of total biomass or reproductive output. Field rosinweed failed to mount a tolerance-enhancing regrowth response because galls, resource availability, and competition combined to constrain axillary meristem growth. Gall-wasp performance was largely independent of rosinweed tolerance. Emergence, growth, sex ratios, and parasitism were comparable in field and garden, and only slightly affected by resource availability. Gall-insect performance may be buffered from environmental variation, disconnecting plant and herbivore population dynamics. Rosinweed's poor tolerance of gall damage may typify forb responses to herbivory in highly competitive grassland plant communities.

AB Morbidity associated with human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection was investigated in a Japanese population within an area in which HTLV-I infection is endemic. Of 1824 subjects enrolled in the Miyazaki Cohort Study between November 1984 and May 1991, 500 (27.4%) were seropositive for HTLV-I antibodies, As expected from previous studies, HTLV-I positivity appeared to be associated with baseline history of anemia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.99-1.7) and kidney disease (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 0.91-2.9); a positive association also was noted for asthma in men (OR = 3.4; 95% CI = 1.2-9.8), Unanticipated findings included a relationship between HTLV-I infection and cardiac disease history (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.94-2.2); HTLV-I carriers also were more likely to have an abnormal electrocardiogram at baseline (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.2-1.9), Furthermore, an apparent protective effect for ulcers (OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40-0.95) and diabetes (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.22-1.1) was observed, HTLV-I infection may modify the risk of specific disease outcomes by altering host immune function.

TI Host-pathogen systems in a spatially patchy environment
AB A discrete model for a host-pathogen system is developed and is used to represent the dynamics in each patch within a landscape of n x n patches. These patches are linked by between-generation dispersal to neighbouring patches. Important results (compared to similar 'coupled map lattice' studies) include an increase in the likelihood of metapopulation extinction if the natural loss of pathogen particles is low, and the observation of a radial wave pattern (not previously reported) where the wavefront propagates uniformly from a central focus. This result has additional significance in that it permits the system to exhibit 'intermittency' between two quasi-stable spatial patterns: spirals and radial waves. With intermittent behaviour, the dynamics may look consistent when viewed at one time scale, but over a longer time scale they can alter dramatically and repeatedly between the two patterns. There is also evidence of clear links between spatial structure and temporal metapopulation behaviour in both the intermittent and 'pure' regions, verified by results from an algorithmic complexity measure and a spectral analysis of the temporal dynamics.

TI Ethnic differences in immune responses to hepatitis B vaccine
AB A national vaccination program against hepatitis B virus (HBV) to immunize every newborn was initiated in Taiwan in 1986, A serologic survey of 1,812 fully vaccinated children residing in four aboriginal villages and four adjacent nonaboriginal Han Chinese rural villages was conducted in 1993, Children in three of the four aboriginal villages had significantly lower titers of antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) than did children in the nonaboriginal villages. Evaluation of cold chain operation for vaccine storage and transport suggested that cold chain failure was not responsible for the fact that children residing in the more remote aboriginal villages had lower mean titers of anti-HBs, However, children whose parents were both aborigines had lower anti-HBs mean titer than did children whose parents were both ethnic Han Chinese, Children of mixed parental origins had intermediate mean titer of anti-HBs, Serologic responses to Japanese encephalitis virus and diphtheria vaccines did not show such correlation with ethnic groups, indicating that the determinant for. HBV hyporesponsiveness among the aboriginal children is distinct from that of other childhood vaccines, It was therefore concluded that host factors pertaining to ethnic origin might be responsible for the hyporesponsiveness to HBV vaccine in the aboriginal populations, This finding, if substantiated with further prospective studies, might provide possible means for more targeted trials to improve vaccine response and to reduce vaccine failure among these well-defined ethnic groups.

TI Trends in human immunodeficiency virus seroprevalence among injection
   drug users entering drug treatment centers, United States, 1988-1993
AB National unlinked sentinel surveillance data were used to describe trends in prevalent human immunodeficiency Virus infection among injection drug users entering drug treatment programs in the United States from 1988 through 1993. During this 6-year period, unlinked testing was performed on 70,882 specimens from injection drug users at 60 sentinel sites. The annual change in seroprevalence was estimated for each site by odds ratios obtained from logistic regression models fit within site-specific age and race/ethnicity subgroups. Overall trends for age and race/ethnicity subgroups across sites were described by summary odds ratios calculated using the inverse variance method. A decrease was observed among younger (age less than 30 years) whites both in areas with high (10% or higher) and low (less than 10%) prevalence, although this decrease was significant only in high-prevalence areas (odds ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.99). Seroprevalence also decreased among older whites in high-prevalence areas, although this decrease was not significant (odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.84-1.00). Seroprevalence remained stable among all other age and race/ethnicity subgroups. Stable seroprevalence. among the dynamic population of injection drug users entering treatment suggests continued transmission among these individuals in both high- and low-prevalence areas of the United States.

TI Detection of very low level Plasmodium falciparum infections using the
   nested polymerase chain reaction and a reassessment of the epidemiology
   of unstable malaria in Sudan
AB We have used the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assay for low level Plasmodium falciparum infections that were below the threshold of detection of blood film examination. This revealed a substantial group of asymptomatic, submicroscopically patent infections within the population of a Sudanese village present throughout the year although clinical malaria episodes were almost entirely confined to the transmission season. In our September, January, April, and June surveys, the PCR-detected prevalences were 13%, 19%, 24%, and 19%, respectively. These figures reveal a much higher prevalence of dry season infection than previous microscopic surveys have indicated. Furthermore, 20% of a cohort of 79 individuals were healthy throughout the September to November transmission season but were PCR-positive for P. falciparum in a least one of a series of samples taken in the ensuing months. Levels of exposure to P. falciparum infection were therefore higher than was previously believed in this region, highlighting the fact that many individuals were infected but healthy for most of the year. The reservoir parasite population was thus larger and more stable than previously thought, a finding that is consistent with the high levels of genetic variation at polymorphic loci reported from analysis of P. falciparum parasites in this area.

TI Seroepidemiology of La Crosse virus infection in humans in western North
   Carolina
AB On the Cherokee Indian Reservation and surrounding area of western North Carolina, an area-wide serosurvey was conducted to determine the prevalence of neutralizing antibody to La Crosse (LAG) virus. A questionnaire was used to identify risk factors important in exposure to virus-infected mosquitoes in populations near the reservation. Of 1,008 serum samples tested, 9.6% were positive for LAC virus antibody. For samples solely collected from on (n = 311) or off (n = 697) the reservation, the prevalence of seropositive samples was 20.6% on the reservation and only 4.7% off the reservation. Seropositivity increased directly with age, indicating that transmission of LAC virus was highly endemic. Age and location residence (on versus off the reservation) were significant risk factors for exposure to LAC virus. Persons on the reservation were 5.5 times more likely to have been exposed to LAC virus than were people who reside off the reservation. An additive increase in risk of 1.5 times over each age group was found, so that the oldest age group (greater than or equal to 75 years) was 7.5 times more likely to have been exposed to LAC virus than was the youngest age group (< 1-14 years).

TI Epidemic disease and the catastrophic decline of Australian rain forest
   frogs
AB In the montane rain forests of eastern Australia at least 14 species of endemic, stream-dwelling frogs have disappeared or declined sharply (by more than 90%) during the past 15 years. We review available information on these declines and present eight lines of evidence that collectively suggest that a rapidly spreading, epidemic disease is the most likely responsible agent. The extreme virulence of the putative frog pathogen suggests it is likely exotic to Australian rain forests. We propose that exotic pathogens may be responsible for some recent declines of amphibian populations on other continents and that the intercontinental spread of such pathogens is greatly facilitated by human activities such as the thriving international trade in aquarium fish. Our hypothesis may help explain why some amphibian populations in seemingly pristine environments have mysteriously declined.

TI Seed dispersers as disease vectors: Bird transmission of mistletoe seeds
   to plant hosts
AB The relationship between mistletoes and birds has been studied from the perspectives of mutualism and seed dispersal. Here, we emphasize the role that avian dispersers play as agents of mistletoe seed transmission to plant hosts. We describe the patterns of transmission of the seeds of Tristerix aphyllus, an endophytic Chilean mistletoe, on two of its columnar cacti hosts (Eulychnia acida and Echinopsis skottsbergii) by the Chilean Mockingbird Mimus thenca. In north-central Chile, these cacti grow in relatively discrete subpopulations on north-facing slopes. We measured variation in seed transmission within 10 subpopulations varying in species composition, host density, parasite density, parasite prevalence (defined as the percentage of hosts infested in a given population), and disperser abundance. Seed transmission was independent of species, but was strongly dependent on prior parasitism. Parasitized individuals received seeds much more frequently than expected from their relative abundance. We found no correlation between the density of hosts and seed transmission. We found strong positive correlations, however, between parasite prevalence and seed transmission to both parasitized and nonparasitized hosts. Seed transmission of T. aphyllus seeds by M. thenca appeared to be frequency- rather than density-dependent. Seed transmission was also tightly and positively correlated with the abundance of seed-dispersing birds at each site. Because bird abundance and parasite prevalence were correlated, we conducted path analysis to disentangle their relative effect on seed transmission. A model including only the direct effect of bird abundance and the indirect effect of parasite prevalence through bird abundance explained roughly the same variance as a full model including both the direct and indirect effects of bird abundance and prevalence on seed transmission. Apparently, variation in bird abundance was the main determinant of variation in transmission. We suggest that mistletoes, host plants, and the birds that disperse mistletoe seeds are systems well suited for studies of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of disease transmission.

TI The evolution and maintenance of virulence in microparasites
AB In recent years, population and evolutionary biologists have questioned the traditional view that parasite-mediated morbidity and mortality-virulence-is a primitive character and an artifact of recent associations between parasites and their hosts. A number of hypotheses have been proposed that favor virulence and suggest that it will be maintained by natural selection. According to some of these hypotheses, the pathogenicity of HIV, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the Shigella, as well as Plasmodium falciparum, and many other microparasites, are not only maintained by natural selection, but their virulence increases or decreases as an evolutionary response to changes in environmental conditions or the density and/or behavior of the human population. Other hypotheses propose that the virulence of microparasites is not directly favored by natural selection; rather, microparasite-mediated morbidity and mortality are either coincidental to parasite-expressed characters (virulence determinants that evolved for other functions) or the product of short-sighted evolution in infected hosts. These hypotheses for the evolution and maintenance of microparasite virulence are critically reviewed, and suggestions are made for testing them experimentally.

TI Quantitative genetics and population dynamics
AB This study examines the dynamics of a competition and a host-parasite model in which the interactions are determined by quantitative characters. Both models are extensions of one-dimensional difference equations that can exhibit complicated dynamics. Compared to these basic models, the phenotypic variability given by the quantitative characters reduces the size of the density fluctuations in asexual populations. With sexual reproduction, which is described by modeling the genetics of the quantitative character explicitly with many haploid loci that determine the character additively, this reduction in fitness variance is magnified. Moreover, quantitative genetics can induce simple dynamics. For example, the sexual population can have a two-cycle when the asexual system is chaotic. This paper discusses the consequences for the evolution of sex. The higher mean growth rate implied by the lower fitness variance in sexual populations is an advantage that can overcome a twofold intrinsic growth rate of asexuals. The advantage is bigger when the asexual population contains only a subset of the phenotypes present in the sexual population, which conforms with the tangled bank theory for the evolution of sex and shows that tangled bank effects also occur in host-parasite systems. The results suggest that explicitly describing the genetics of a quantitative character leads to more flexible models than the usual assumption of normal character distributions, and therefore to a better understanding of the character's impact on population dynamics.

TI Evolutionary patterns of altered behavior and susceptibility in
   parasitized hosts
AB Adaptation is the usual context for interpreting parasite-host interactions. For example, altered host behavior is often interpreted as a parasite adaptation, because in some cases it enhances parasite transmission. Resistance to parasites also has obvious adaptive value for hosts. However, it is difficult to evaluate the adaptive significance of host-parasite interactions without considering the historical context in which these traits have evolved and if they can be predicted by host (or parasite) phylogeny. We examined the influence of host phylogeny on patterns of altered behavior and resistance to parasitism in a cockroach-acanthocephalan system. A consensus cladogram for cockroach subfamilies was produced from the morphological data of McKittrick. We used this cladogram to predict patterns of altered host behavior in seven cockroach host species. Each species was experimentally infected with a single species of acanthocephalan, Moniliformis moniliformis, a parasite that is transmitted when cockroaches are eaten by rodent final hosts. Activity patterns, substrate choices, and responses to light were measured for control and infected animals. These data were recoded into a behavioral matrix of discrete characters. We determined the most parsimonious distribution of the behavioral characters on the tree obtained from McKittrick's data. We then measured the concordance between the behavioral data and the cockroach cladogram with the consistency index (CI). We compared the observed CI to the expected value based on a randomization of observed character states. For three different models of evolutionary character change, there was no evidence of strong concordance (significantly large CI) between altered host behavior and host relationships. Parsimony analysis of the interior nodes of the phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that unaltered behavior was the ancestral state for most host behaviors. We also compared host phylogeny to a data set on the susceptibility of 29 cockroach species to infection with M. moniliformis. At the species level, there was a significant concordance between susceptibility and host phylogeny. This pattern was consistent with the finding that susceptibility of species varied significantly among different subfamilies. However, at the subfamily level, susceptibility was not strongly concordant with phylogeny. We predict that, given enough time, resistance should be lost in subfamilies that are currently resistant to parasitism. In spite of the potential importance of phylogeny in the evolution of behavior and susceptibility, we found little evidence for phylogenetic effects in this system. We conclude that changes in the behavioral responses of hosts to parasites and, to a lesser extent, changes in susceptibility are more frequent than cockroach speciation events in different cockroach lineages. This finding strengthens the assertion that at least some of the altered behaviors are adaptive for host and/or parasite.

TI Life-history traits in parasitic nematodes: A comparative approach for
   the search of invariants
AB 1. This study investigates the evolution of life-history traits in parasitic and free-living nematodes. A database on 35 species was assembled for values on: body size of female nematodes; egg production; life expectancies of both adult and free-stages; the length of maturation time for free-living nematodes and prepatent period for parasites (time needed for an infective stage to reach maturity in its definitive host). Comparative methods were used to account for the effects of phylogeny.
   2. The well-known allometries of life-history traits with body size were found, such as the allometry between size and total fecundity. Daily fecundity and prepatent period of parasitic nematodes are both correlated with body size, suggesting that delaying maturity increases fecundity.
   3. Phylogeny affects relationships between investigated life-history traits, i.e. daily reproductive output (b) and female life expectancy (1/M).
   4. Prepatent period (a) in parasitic nematodes is equivalent to maturation time (a) of free-living nematodes.
   5. A search was carried out for life-history invariants (Charnov 1993). There was no correlation between prepatent period (a) and daily reproductive output (b) and hence no invariant ab. This could be explained by constrained life styles of reproduction among Nematoda. Indeed, invariant aM (or aM, where M is the mortality rate of adult stage) were found for both parasites of vertebrate ((aM) = 0.23) and free-living, plant and insect nematodes ((aM) = 0.05).
   6. A causal chain of evolution of life-history traits of parasite nematodes is proposed and discussed. It is suggested that adult mortality is the main factor driving the evolution of life-history traits.

TI Eradication of poliomyelitis: When can one be sure that polio virus
   transmission has been terminated?
AB Most polio virus infections are silent. Vaccination reduces the incidence of infection, and the period between clinical cases of poliomyelitis becomes longer. As the point of eradication is approached, it becomes increasingly difficult to use the case-free period to determine whether silent infections have ceased. In this paper, the authors use stochastic computer simulations to relate case-free periods to the presence or absence of silent infections. After 2 years without paralytic cases in a population of 200,000 inhabitants, the probability for the presence of silent infections can still be as high as 38%. The case-free period must exceed 3 years before one can be 95% certain that there has been local extinction of the wild polio virus infection. Even after 5 years without cases, the probability of silent polio virus transmission can still be in the range of 0.1-1.0%.

TI High seroprevalence of hepatitis A, B, C, and E viruses in residents in
   an Egyptian village in Nile Delta: A pilot study
AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is hyperendemic in Egypt, with seroprevalence rates of 10-20% among volunteer blood donors, and even higher rates reported among segments of the general population. We attempted to confirm the high seroprevalence of HCV and to compare it with the age-specific seroprevalence rates for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis E among 155 nonrandomly selected residents of a semiurban village in the Nile River delta. Of the two orally transmitted viruses (HAV and HEV), all 1-3-year-old children had been infected by HAN and the seroprevalence rate of 100% persisted until age 67. In contrast, HEV infections were not detected until children were 4-9-years old, and the 57% seroprevalence rate in this age group did not increase appreciably in older age groups. Of the two parenterally transmitted viruses, HBV was first detected in 1-3-year-olds, whereas HCV was first detected later, in 10-19-year-olds. The seroprevalence rates of both viruses increased progressively with age, peaking in the 40-67-year-old group at 66% for HBV and at 51% For HCV. The number of persons who had only one infection, or no infection at all, was too small to allow meaningful statistical analysis of serologically pure groups infected only by HBV, HCV, or HEV. The results of this pilot study revealed extraordinarily high seroprevalence rates of HBV, HCV, and KEV in this village, and distinctive age-specific seroprevalence rates suggesting different patterns of transmission.

TI A waterborne outbreak of hepatitis E virus transmission in southwestern
   Vietnam
AB A hepatitis outbreak affecting primarily adults occurred in southwestern Vietnam, along the Hau river bordering Cambodia, in June and July 1994. One month after the outbreak, sera and epidemiologic information were collected from 150 subjects: 50 patient cases, 50 matched, healthy community controls, and 50 geographic controls living 50 km upriver. The prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to hepatitis E virus (HEV) was significantly (P < 0.001) higher (76%) among cases than among the matched (38%), and geographic (38%) control populations. Immunoglobulin M to HEV was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot in 16% of sera collected from patients one month after the outbreak. Hepatitis E virus RNA was detected with the polymerase chain reaction in 6% of sera from patients; RNA was not detected in either control group. These results indicate that HEV was the etiologic agent responsible for the outbreak. Children were under-represented among clinical cases. River water served as the principal source for drinking and bathing among most (96%) of the case and control study populations. Boiling of drinking water was negatively associated (P < 0.05) with IgG anti-HEV seropositivity. Unusually heavy rainfall likely contributed to conditions that favored the outbreak. This is the first recognized outbreak of epidemic HEV transmission in Indo-China.

TI Different genetic characteristics of Plasmodium falciparum isolates
   collected during successive clinical malaria episodes in Senegalese
   children
AB A narrow epidemiologic survey was conducted during a four-month period of intense malaria transmission in Dielmo, a holoendemic Senegalese village. Longitudinal clinical and parasitologic follow-up indicate that clinical malaria episodes always occurred after an abrupt increase in parasite densities. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of Plasmodium falciparum parasites was carried out in blood samples collected longitudinally from 10 children who had experienced several clinical episodes during this period. Our data show that the genetic diversity of the parasites circulating in this village is very large. The successive clinical episodes experienced by each child were caused by genetically distinct parasite populations that were recently inoculated and multiplied in an apparently unrestricted manner. importantly, the genetic characteristics of the parasite populations detected during phases of asymptomatic carriage differed from those causing a clinical episode, suggesting that the various factors that control of parasite growth in these children are strain-specific.

TI Immunomodulatory properties of maxadilan, the vasodilator peptide from
   sand fly salivary gland extracts
AB Sand flies are the arthropod vector of leishmaniasis and salivary gland extracts from these flies exacerbate leishmaniasis in vivo. The mechanism of exacerbation appears to be due to immunomodulatory effects of the saliva on host immune function but the active component is unknown. The following studies reveal that maxadilan, the vasodilatory peptide present in sand fly salivary gland extracts, has immunomodulatory properties. To examine the effect of maxadilan on T cell proliferation, the peptide was added to murine spleen cells stimulated with either concanavalin A or plate-bound anti-T cell receptor antibody. Inhibition of proliferation was noted in a dose-dependent manner for both sets of experiments (P < 0.05). To examine the effect of maxadilan on alloantigen presentation, the peptide was added to mixed lymphocyte and mixed epidermal cell lymphocyte reactions. Inhibition of proliferation was found in these culture systems. Maxadilan also inhibited the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in mice (P < 0.05). These observations suggest a role for maxadilan in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis since the peptide may inhibit the immune response at the site of parasite inoculation, allowing the infection to proceed.

TI Phage therapy revisited: The population biology of a bacterial infection
   and its treatment with bacteriophage and antibiotics
AB Phage therapy is the use of bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) to treat bacterial infections. It has been practiced sporadically on humans and domestic animals for nearly 75 yr. Nevertheless, phage therapy has remained outside the mainstream of modern medicine, presumably because of doubts about its efficacy, and possibly because it was eclipsed by antibiotics and other chemotherapeutic agents. In this report, we develop the study of phage therapy and antibiotic therapy as a population biological phenomenon-the dynamic interaction of bacteria with a predator (phage) or a toxic chemical (antibiotic) inside a host whose immune and other defenses also affect the interaction. Our goal is to identify the conditions under which phage and antibiotics can successfully control a bacterial infection and when they cannot. We review data published in the 1980s by H. Williams Smith and J. B. Huggins on the use of phage and antibiotics to control lethal, systemic infections of Escherichia coli in experimentally inoculated mice. We show that some of their observations can be accommodated by a quantitative model that invokes known or plausible assumptions about host defenses and the interactions of bacteria with phage and antibiotics; some observations remain unexplained by the model. Our analysis identifies several hypotheses about the population dynamics of phage and antibiotic therapy that can be tested experimentally. Included among these are hypotheses that account for variation in the efficacy of the different phages employed by Smith and Huggins and why, in their study, phages were more effective than antibiotics.

TI Population dynamics and genetics of plant disease: A case study of
   anther-smut disease
AB A model by Levin and Udovic (1977) emphasizes the need for integration of studies of the numerical abundances and genetic composition of host and pathogen species. We use their conceptual framework to summarize our collaborative research on the ecological genetics of the anther-smut disease of Silene alba caused by the fungus Ustilago violacea. Our theoretical investigations have revealed the importance of the rate and mode of disease transmission on the likelihood of coexistence between host and pathogen. Our empirical studies have quantified patterns of disease spread on local and regional spatial scales and have shown that host genotypes differ greatly in resistance. Comparable genetic variation in pathogen virulence has not yet been demonstrated. The genetic composition of host populations alters numerical dynamics in experimental populations: disease declines in resistant populations, while host and pathogen appear to coexist in susceptible populations. Ecological outcomes also may be affected by the negative relationship between disease incidence and host flowering time, which may constitute a ''cost'' to resistance. We are currently expanding our work on the ecology and genetics of metapopulation dynamics of host and pathogen.

TI Evolution and stasis in plant-pathogen associations
AB The impact of disease on plant populations may change as a result of coevolutionary interactions. The Red Queen hypothesis suggests that parasites provide a selective advantage to host sexual recombination sufficient to explain its persistence despite the twofold advantage of asexual reproduction. The constant production of resistant host genotypes by sexual recombination favors parasite genotypes that can overcome host resistance, resulting in a coevolutionary ''arms race.'' Systemic fungal parasites differ from nonsystemic fungi in ways that affect plant-pathogen interactions. Many systemic fungal parasites castrate their host plants, which reduces the potential for production of genetically variable, resistant progeny. Moreover, host genotypes susceptible to infection by the maternal pathogen are perpetuated through parasite-induced asexual reproduction or enforced selfing. Grasses in the genus Danthonia infected by Atkinsonella hypoxylon represent a model system for investigating evolution and stasis in plant-pathogen associations. Infected plants, unlike uninfected plants, reproduce only by self-fertilized seed through which the fungus is vertically transmitted. Other similar associations exist, suggesting that parasites can often enforce genetic uniformity within host populations.

TI Competition between viruses in a complex plant-pathogen
AB Interactions among viruses, vectors, and host plants may influence the spread and success of plant viruses. Major factors include direct competition within host plants, direct competition within vectors, differences in transmission rates, and virus influences on vector behavior and population dynamics. The aphid-transmitted barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs), which infect a broad range of grasses worldwide, represent a model system for addressing questions about the outcome of direct and indirect competition between viruses. Historical shifts in the relative prevalence of BYDV strains document the apparent displacement of one virus strain (PAV) by another (MAV) over 20 yr.
   In the barley yellow dwarf system, transmission rate appears td play an important role in determining the outcome of competition between viruses. Moreover, the interaction between transmission rate and vector behavior may be particularly important. PAV is the stronger competitor within hosts, where double infections occur more often than in insect vectors. PAV also has significant advantages due to higher overall transmission rates than MAV. In addition, vector aphids show a strong nonpreference for PAV that may lead to greater rates of virus spread.

TI Spatial pattern and process in plant-pathogen interactions
AB An individual host's likelihood of acquiring an infectious disease depends, in large part, on the location of the host relative to sources of infection, proximity to other hosts, and occupation of specific microhabitats that confer increased susceptibility. Spatial organization of the host and pathogen populations then may be critical in determining patterns of disease occurrence and dynamics. We discuss three fundamental problems associated with understanding the interactions of plants, pathogens, and spatial structure: (1) how one characterizes spatial patterns, (2) how we determine spatial dynamic processes from a given spatial pattern, and (3) how we then simulate the spatial dynamics presumed to be dominating a given host-pathogen interaction.
   To demonstrate methods for the characterization of spatial pattern, we analyzed spatial maps of a Silene latifolia population infected with the anther smut Microbotryum violaceum, using join-count statistics, continuous spatial autocorrelation, and Mantel's test. Different statistical techniques provided different interpretations of the same data set, indicating the value of using multiple methods. We described spatial structure in the plant population, the pathogen population (factoring out the plant population structure), and spatial cross correlation between two variables (plant gender and disease status). Each of these tests provides information on how the disease may be spreading in the population.
   We are not very optimistic about the prospect of determining underlying disease-spread processes purely from analysis of spatial pattern. Most spatial patterns can potentially be generated by a number of biological processes (e.g., ''true'' vs. ''apparent'' contagion), and it is not possible to distinguish between hypotheses without additional information about the system.
   A difficulty in modeling spatial processes is simulation of populations with given spatial patterns. Simulated spatially structured populations are useful for predicting disease dynamics in a spatial context. We present a number of techniques for creating these spatially structured populations, including a method we developed for modeling the effect of vector behavior on the spread of a plant virus.

TI The population dynamics of brucellosis in the Yellowstone National Park
AB The role that pathogens play in structuring ecological communities needs to be examined from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. This paper provides a brief introduction to the ecology and epidemiology of brucellosis in Yellowstone National Park. Observed patterns of infection for brucellosis in bison in national parks in the United States suggest that Brucella has a relatively sharply defined threshold for establishment and that the proportion of the host population infected increases as a relatively simple function of population density, Unfortunately, the threshold population for Brucella establishment in bison is low, a herd of at feast 200 individuals; this makes it very hard to eradicate Brucella from wild populations. Simple calculations based on observed prevalence and recruitment data for the Yellowstone bison herd suggest that unacceptably high levels of culling would be required to eradicate brucellosis in the park.
   A simple mathematical model is used to describe aspects of the population dynamics of Brucella. The analyses suggest that an understanding of infectious disease dynamics is crucial to the management and conservation of wild and domestic ungulate species in and around national parks and other nature reserves. The consequences of disease control for the maintenance of biodiversity in other natural and captive communities need to be better understood.

TI Sex-specific costs of resistance to the fungal pathogen Ustilago
   violacea (Microbotryum violaceum) in Silene alba
AB Costs of resistance are often invoked to explain the maintenance of polymorphisms for resistance to fungal pathogens in natural plant populations. To investigate such costs, 27 half-sib families of Silene alba, collected from a single host population, were grown in experiment populations in the presence and absence of the anther-smut fungus Ustilago violacea, a host-sterilizing pathogen transmitted by insects that are both pollinators and vectors of the disease. I lost families differed significantly in resistance to inoculation, indicating the presence of genetic variation for mechanisms that impede fungal growth once the disease is encountered (''biochemical'' resistance) within the host population. in addition. host families differed significantly in onset of flowering and in flower production in the absence of the disease. Path analysis revealed that late onset of flowering In male host families made a direct contribution to high field resistance (P < 0.01), probably due to a reduced rate of contact between hosts and vectors carrying high spore loads (avoidance. or ''phenological'' resistance). The contribution of low flower production to field resistance only approached significance (P < 0.10). There was a significantly positive genetic association between biochemical and phenological resistance, suggesting that delayed flowering is either a pleiotropic effect of biochemical resistance, or that genes governing these traits art in linkage disequilibrium. Path analysis revealed that biochemical resistance made both a direct contribution to field resistance (P < 0.01) and a positive indirect contribution via its association with phenology and flower production (P < 0.05) in male hosts. Costs of resistance were sex specific. Male host families with high field resistance had significantly lower reproductive success in healthy populations, indicating a fitness cost of field resistance (P < 0.01), whereas no costs were detected for female hosts. Path analysis revealed thar the biochemical component of field resistance made: no direct contribution to the observed fitness cost in male hosts, whereas its indirect effect through phenology was only marginally significant (P < 0.10). This finding indicates that fitness costs were mainly due to the phenological component of field resistance. Because the host population had no known history of disease. it is not clear whether the fitness costs are responsible for maintenance of the resistance polymorphism or whether the polymorphism is present for reasons unrelated to pathogen infection. interactions between host families and pathogen strains with respect to inoculation success were not significant. Hence, there was no evidence for indirect costs of biochemical resistance, that is, reduced resistance to alternative strains. infection rates in experimental populations with an initially patchy distribution of the pathogen were lower than in populations with a uniform pathogen distribution, suggesting that the effective pathogen pressure and hence the relative success of susceptible and resistant individuals may, in addition to fitness costs of resistance, depend on the spatial population structure of the pathogen.

TI Space, time and persistence of virulent pathogens
AB Epidemiological theory predicts that pathogens of high virulence should not become endemic. We show, using an empirically based lattice map model, that a pathogen that is too virulent to persist if its host population is spatially well mixed, can persist if the host population is spatially distributed, because of internally generated complex spatial dynamics, provided that the area occupied by the host population is sufficiently large. The dynamics are not an artefact of spatial or temporal discretization. The results uncover a mechanism for the persistence of Virulent pathogens, suggesting a means by which pathogens of high virulence could achieve sustained as well as short-term biological pest control.

TI The curse of the pharaoh: The evolution of virulence in pathogens with
   long living propagules
AB We used a mathematical model to evaluate the hypothesis that parasites and pathogens with long living propagules should evolve high levels of virulence, i.e. high rates of pathogen-induced host mortality. Our model shows that the optimal level of virulence is independent of the longevity of the propagules either: (i) if the density or the prevalence of infected hosts is in (or fluctuates around) equilibrium; or (ii) if the death rate of the infected host population is high compared with that of the propagules. The level of virulence that maximizes the parasite's fitness (Malthusian parameter) increases with increasing longevity of its propagules only if the host-parasite system has not reached equilibrium and the death rate of the propagules is high relative to that of the infected hosts. Therefore, for parasites that have recently invaded a susceptible host population, greater propagule longevity may initially favour higher virulence; but once the equilibrium is reached the optimal virulence is independent of propagule longevity.

TI Dynamically generated variability in plant-pathogen systems with
   biological control
AB Using a combination of replicated microcosm experiments, simple nonlinear modelling and model fitting we show that unexpected levels of variability can be detected and described in the dynamics of plant disease. Temporal development of damping-off disease of radish seedlings caused by an economically important plant pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani, is quantified, with and without the addition of an antagonistic fungus, Trichoderma viride. The biological control agent reduces the average amount of disease but also greatly enhances the variability among replicates. The results are shown to be consistent with predictions from a nonlinear model that exhibits dynamically generated variability in which small differences in the initiation of infection associated with the antagonist are later amplified as the pathogen spreads from plant to plant. The effect of dynamically generated variability is mediated by the interruption of transient disease progress curves for separate replicates by an exponential decrease in susceptibility of the host over time. The decay term essentially 'freezes' the dynamics of the transient behaviour so that the solutions for different replicates settle on asymptotes that depend on initial conditions and parameter values. The effect is further magnified by nonlinear terms in the infection force in the models. A generalization of the Lyapunov exponent is introduced to quantify the amplification. The observed behaviour has profound consequences for the design and interpretation of ecological experiments, and can also account for the notorious failure of many biological control strategies through the creation of 'hot spots', created by the amplification of plant to plant infection, where the control by the antagonist is locally unsuccessful.

TI Silent transmission of the dengue virus in southern Taiwan
AB Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to dengue virus was examined from a total of 3,099 serum samples collected in southern Taiwan. Of 1,232 sera collected from a junior high school and four elementary schools in Liu-Chiu, 35 were IgM-positive, demonstrating that the dengue virus has been circulating on the island, despite the fact that no epidemic has been reported in the past 10 years. Sixteen of 925 sera collected from three elementary schools in Tung-gang in 1991 were found to be IgM-positive and two of 192 sera from adults in the local community were positive, The IgM-positive subjects tended to be aggregated around a port. Fishing boats that had stopped in neighboring endemic countries were presumed to have introduced the virus periodically, causing a low level of inapparent infections. In the Kaohsiung area, two of 108 suspected clinical cases and four of 642 community-based sera were IgM-positive. Rapid urbanization has provided appropriate circumstances for vector breeding in this area and the high population density has also increased contact frequency between humans and mosquito vectors. This has, in turn, increased the possibility of silent transmission of the dengue virus via either intermittent reintroduction of the virus or continuation of inapparent infections or both. Establishment of a early warning system using the IgM antibody capture-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is suggested for effective monitoring of the disease.

   healthy population in Leon, Nicaragua
AB A cross-sectional survey of the seroprevalence of hepatitis A virus (HAV), B (HBV), C (HCV), and E (HEV) antibodies in a healthy population in Leon, Nicaragua was conducted and associated with demographic data. The overall prevalence of antibodies to HAV was 94.6%, to HBV 6.5% and to HEV between 4.6% and 8.0%, whereas none of 399 tested subjects showed confirmed seropositivity to HCV. A high HAV seropositivity rate (72.7%) was observed even in the lowest age groups tested (2-4 years of age). In contrast, HBV and HEV seropositivity was observed mainly in adults, the seroprevalence in > 40-year-old individuals being 15.4% and 17.6%, respectively. The overall mean hepatitis B surface antigen carrier rate was estimated to be 0.9%, and in individuals more than 20 years of age, 2.0%. The prevalence of anti-HAV as well as anti-HEV was significantly higher in people having their water supply outside rather than inside the house. Furthermore anti-HAV seroprevalence correlated with lack of access to a flush toilet. Hepatitis B virus seropositivity was more frequent in people living in a crowded environment than in those living with few household members. These findings indicate that hepatitis A is a childhood infection in Nicaragua and that the spread of the infection is facilitated by poor socioeconomic conditions. In contrast, HBV infection is relatively infrequent in the country and HCV seems to be very uncommon. Hepatitis E virus infection may occur in all age groups and is apparently associated with water-borne transmission.

   Leishmania chagasi
AB Jequie, a community of about 144,500 inhabitants located in the State of Bahia, Brazil, is endemic for both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniases. In the present epidemiologic study, the urban and inhabited periurban areas of the town were divided into 140 clusters of 0.25 km(2) each. The seroprevalence of canine Leishmania antibodies was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as a screening test since its sensitivity was significantly higher than that of an indirect immunofluorescence assay, A total of 1,681 dogs was surveyed in 34 randomly sampled clusters. The overall prevalence of Leishmania antibodies in the dog population was 23.5%, with intracluster prevalences ranging from 0% to 67%. There was no correlation of these seroprevalences with the intracluster densities of canine populations, or with the distances from individual clusters to the town center. Moreover, the Leishmania transmission did not seem to follow any clear-cut spatial pattern, since large disparities in the seroprevalences of contiguous clusters were found. Curiously, human cases of visceral leishmaniasis have never been observed in some clusters with a relatively high prevalence of canine seroprevalences. Eight parasite isolates from seropositive dogs were found to belong to the same serodeme and zymodeme as Leishmania (L.) chagasi. The implications of these findings with respect to the epidemiology and control of American visceral leishmaniasis are discussed.

TI Ectoparasitic effects on host survival and reproduction: The
   Drosophila-Macrocheles association
AB Numerous insects, including Drosophila nigrospiracula, that inhabit necrotic cacti of the Sonoran desert are host to Macrocheles subbadius, a cosmopolitan mesostigmatid mite. This paper shows that the mite pierces Drosophila integument and ingests haemolymph while attached to the abdomen of its host. Among field-caught flies, there was a strong negative relationship between mite load and wet mass of adult flies of both sexes. Thus, M. subbadius is an ectoparasite of D. nigrospiracula, contrary to the widespread belief that macrochelids form only phoretic associations with adult flies. The parasite harms its host in many ways. Under laboratory conditions, there was a significant negative effect of mite load on survivorship. In the field, there was a significant negative relationship between mite load and number of eggs carried by sexually mature females, suggesting that infested females resorb their oocytes to compensate for nutritional stress imposed by feeding mites. Likewise, in the laboratory, infestation lengthened somewhat the period prior to onset of oviposition, and decreased the number of eggs laid by females over their life. However, mite-infested females maintained on a yeast-supplemented diet overcame the potentially debilitating effects of mites, and were actually slightly, but not significantly, more fertile than uninfested females. Since the dietary conditions of flies influenced the degree to which fecundity was affected, the debilitating effect of mites is comparable to that of starvation. This conclusion derives support from the observation that laboratory females infested for 4 d, but whose mites were subsequently removed, produced fewer progeny than uninfested females. Although this effect was significant only among old females, it nevertheless indicates that the observed effects of mites on fecundity are not the result of mechanical constraints on oviposition behavior. Since intensities of infestation used in laboratory experiments were similar to those encountered in nature, observed ectoparasitic effects on fly fitness suggest that M. subbadius can reduce fly numbers in nature.

TI Parasitic plant-host interactions: Plant performance and indirect
   effects on parasite-feeding herbivores
AB While the role of parasites in shaping population and community dynamics has been increasingly appreciated, researchers have largely ignored the ecology of parasitic plants. Parasitic plants obtain water, sugar, nitrogen compounds, and a variety of secondary metabolites from their host plants. In a greenhouse study, I examined the direct interactions of a parasitic plant, Castilleja wightii (Scrophulariaceae), with three plant hosts and the indirect effects of this parasitism on the performance of a parasite-feeding herbivore. The three host species, Lupinus arboreus, Artemisia pycnocephala, and Eriophyllum staechadifolium, directly and differentially affected C. wightii flower production, although parasite biomass was not affected by host species. Surprisingly, parasite performance was weakest when attacking a leguminous host, although parasite total nitrogen was highest when growing on a legume. Parasites also exerted a strong direct effect on host performance: host dry mass was negatively correlated with parasite mass for all three host species tested. However, this effect differed among hosts: for E. staechadifolium, proportionately larger parasite mass was correlated with smaller overall biomass of the host and parasite combined, while for the other two hosts, overall host-parasite mass was not correlated with parasite mass, indicating that E. staechadifolium was more affected by parasite attack than were the other host species. Finally, host plant chemistry had strong indirect effects on the performance of an aphid, Nearctaphis kachena, that feeds on C. wightii. Aphids feeding on C. wightii that were parasitizing L. arboreus (alkaloid-producing, high nitrogen), A. pycnocephala (alkaloid-free, intermediate nitrogen), and E. staechadifolium (terpenoid-producing, low nitrogen) experienced 68.2, 65.3, and 49.5% survival, respectively. Further, aphids feeding on parasites using L. arboreus and A. pycnocephala produced 2.43 and 1.77 times more offspring on average than those feeding on parasites using E. staechadifolium. My results indicate that interactions between plant parasites and different host species can have strong direct effects on both host and parasite performance, as well as marked effects on the tritrophic interactions among plant hosts, parasitic plants, and their herbivores.

TI Experimental prevention of a population cycle in red grouse
AB Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) show unstable population dynamics. The number shot for sport at Rickarton moor in northeast Scotland, for example, has cycled with 10-11-yr periodicity since 1946. Here, demographic and other causes of a population cycle were documented from 1979-1989, and an experiment tested the prediction that removing some cocks during the increase phase would prevent a subsequent cyclic decline, Throughout the study, sport shooting was stopped on the area where the main work was done. During 1979-1982, before the experimental removal of cocks began, numbers over the whole moor rose from a trough at the start of the study. On the control area, the cyclic peak in 1983 was followed by a decline until 1988, as predicted in advance from models derived from a previous study elsewhere. On the experimental area, enough territorial cocks were removed each spring from 1982 to 1986 to prevent the population from attaining peak densities for five successive years, and no cyclic decline occurred. The removal of cocks resulted in similar numbers of hens being lost from the breeding population. The main demographic cause of population change on control (cycling) and experimental (cycle broken) areas was variation in the recruitment of young cocks to the spring population. On the control area, recruitment was related to cycle phase and breeding success. Changes in food, nitrogen metabolism, and parasite burdens could not explain the cycle. Demographic patterns were consistent with a model in which changes in age structure affected recruitment. These and previous results refute four hypotheses as necessary causes of population cycles in Red Grouse: (1) maternal nutrition, (2) a version of Chitty's genetic hypothesis, (3) host-parasite (caecal threadworm), and (4) predator-prey relationships. The hypothesis that age structure changes and associated behavior cause cycles by affecting recruitment and, thus, population change, remains unrefuted..

TI Polymorphism of the Drosophila melanogaster - Sigma virus system
AB In natural populations of D. melanogaster, a minority of flies are usually infected by the sigma Rhabdovirus, which is not contagious but vertically transmitted. A few parameters have been identified that affect the evolution of the Drosophila sigma system. Various sets of values of these parameters in males mutually adapted to one another have been established in different populations. This study analyses female characteristics that were previously reputed not to vary much between populations. The newly collected data show that these characteristics (mainly transovarial transmission here) may also be polymorphic in the wild, and may contribute to the diversity of equilibria established between the virus and its host. The observations presented here, obtained from various populations, confirm the complexity of this system of two coevolving organisms: as already noted there seem to be as many different sets of values of parameters as there are populations.

TI Demographic patterns after an epizootic of keratoconjunctivitis in a

AB Data on short- and long-term consequences of epizootics on population dynamics are needed to understand limiting processes in populations and to establish management rules for hunted species. We studied a chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) population in the French Alps that was affected by an epizootic of keratoconjunctivitis in 1977. This epizootic and the removal of 122 infected chamois led to a 37% decrease in population size. We investigated the short-term (i.e., 1977-81) and long-term (i.e., 1982-93) effects of the epizootic on reproductive parameters, finite rate of increase, and body mass. Reproductive performance and finite rate of increase climbed from 0.67 and 1.08 between 1977 and 1981, and to 0.86 and 1.13 between 1982 and 1993. Whatever the age, mass of males born during 1977-81 was lower than mass of those born after 1982 (P < 0.01), suggesting a long-term cohort effect. In the absence of hunting and removals, the population would have recovered its pre-epizootic size, reproductive parameters and rate of increase in about 5 years. We discuss the relation between population density and keratoconjunctivitis outbreaks. Because of little knowledge of transmission routes and of the host-pathogen system, and because keratoconjunctivitis is not a threat for chamois conservation, we suggested adoption of a posteriori management rules rather than rules aimed at disease prevention.

AB Rates of copia transposition were determined directly, by cytological in situ hybridization analysis of sites of copia insertion in progeny of males from sublines of an inbred strain with different genomic copia copy numbers. Copia transposition rate was positively and nonlinearly associated with copia copy number. This relation cannot be simply explained by mutations in a single host factor that normally supresses transposition, or by mutations ill copia elements themselves. We postulate that the number of copia viruslike particles, necessary for copia transposition, could depend nonlinearly on copia copy number. Deleterious side-effects of the transposition process may be an important force controlling copia copy number in natural populations.

TI Clinal variation for local adaptation in a host-parasite interaction
AB Using a reciprocal cross-infection experiment, we detected clinal variation in the relative ability of trematodes to infect snails taken from the same habitat. Snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) collected from three habitats in a New Zealand lake were exposed to a digenetic trematode (Microphallus sp.) collected from infected snails from the same three locations, The habitats were arranged according to depth, from shallow (the shore bank habitat: less than 1 m deep), to intermediate (the Isoetes habitat: 1.5-3 m), to deep (the Elodea habitat: 4-6 m). Snails were assayed for infection at two points in the development of the parasite: 4-months post infection (the blastocercariae stage), in which the parasite was not yet infective to the final hosts (ducks), and 7-months post infection (the metacercariae stage), in which the worms were fully encysted and competent for transmission to the final host. At 7-months post infection, the results showed that shallow-water parasites were significantly more infective to shallow-water hosts, but deep-water parasites were about equally infective to snails from all three habitats. This result suggests that gene flow by the parasite is primarily from shallow to deep habitats, and that recycling of the parasite and host-parasite coevolution is primarily in shallow water. Such recycling would be consistent with our observations of foraging by the definitive host of the parasite, and may explain the maintenance of high frequencies of sexual individuals around the shallow-water margins of the lake.

TI Anti-CD4 therapy for AIDS suggested by mathematical models
AB HIV-1 infection typically involves a long clinical latency stage during which CD4 counts decline slowly. For the later part of the clinical latency stage it was found recently that this is a highly dynamic phase characterized by rapid turnover rates. Clinical latency can therefore be considered as a quasi-equilibrium state in which CD4 and HIV-1 turnover are in almost perfect balance. Here we consider this quasiequilibrium to be the stable steady state of a simple host-parasite model in which the parasite (HIV-1) level is determined by the availability of infectable hosts (activated CD4(+) T cells). Such models adequately account for the clinical data on the evolution of drug resistant mutants appearing after the administration of anti-HIV drugs. The model suggests a novel therapeutic approach for AIDS: reducing the CD4 count slightly will strongly reduce the HIV load. Combining this anti-CD4 treatment with conventional anti-HIV therapy would prevent the outgrowth of drug resistant mutants.

TI Infant parasite rates and immunoglobulin in seroprevalence as a measure
   of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum during a randomized controlled
   trial of insecticide-treated bed nets on the Kenyan coast
AB Repeated cross-sectional surveys among infants sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets (ITBN) and contemporary control infants were used to estimate changes in Plasmodium falciparum exposure due to ITBN use on the Kenyan coast. Presence of P. falciparum parasites or total P. falciparum Immunoglobulin M (IgM) seropositivity were used independently and in combination in a constant risk catalytic conversion model to estimate the force of infection in ITBN and control communities. Such studies during infancy avoid problems of early saturation of prevalence due to high forces of infection and persistence of infection, minimize problems of self-treatment, and can be conducted among large populations covering a wide geographic area, These contrast previous parasitologic studies of ITBN among older children and the traditional entomologic studies of transmission that are logistically demanding. Our investigations demonstrated that parasite prevalence, IgM seropositivity, and the force of transmission were all significantly reduced by 50%. In addition, more infants under ITBN entered their second year of life without previous exposure to P. falciparum than control infants. These effects upon delayed acquisition of effective immunity require careful monitoring during future vector control programs using ITBN.

TI Host-parasite coexistence: The role of spatial refuges in stabilizing
   bacteria-phage interactions
AB We manipulated a bacteria-phage model system to investigate empirical and theoretical conditions allowing for the coexistence of an Escherichia coli host with each of two virulent phage species, a T1-like phage (T1X) and lambda vir. In minimal medium in the laboratory, bacteria coexisted with each phage species in continuous (chemostat) culture; however, in serial culture, T1X rapidly became extinct in all cases and lambda vir became extinct in most cases. When we refined a previously developed mechanistic model of bacteria-phage interactions in continuous culture, this model failed to predict our laboratory observations of long-term stability of bacteria and phage in chemostats. A serial transfer version of this model, however, came much closer to predicting bacteria-phage dynamics. To investigate why models of continuous culture failed, we tested hypotheses for phage persistence by manipulating experimental culture conditions. We found that wall populations of bacteria strongly influenced the stability of both phage species. When wall populations were not allowed to develop in chemostats, both phage species became extinct rapidly; conversely, when wall populations were allowed to develop in serial transfer, both phage species showed evidence of long-term persistence. The final percentage of sensitive bacteria was significantly higher in walls than in liquid populations, suggesting that glass surfaces did indeed act as a spatial refuge for sensitive bacteria. In addition, serial transfer of bacteria and phage on agar surfaces produced more stable interactions than in liquid. We discuss these results in light of previous observations of bacteria-phage interactions and in the broader context of parasite-host and predator-prey coexistence conditions.

TI Hepatitis B virus infection in general population in Madagascar:
   Evidence for different epidemiological patterns in urban and in rural
   areas
AB To describe the features of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Madagascar, a randomized sero-epidemiological survey was undertaken in the general population greater than or equal to 1 year old of two provinces which represents 45% of the total population. In the 921 sera tested, the prevalence of HBV markers was 20.5% for HBsAg, 38.2% for anti-HBc and 6.9% for HBeAg. HBsAg and anti-HBc prevalence rates were significantly higher in males. A large difference in HBsAg prevalence was observed between urban (5.3%) and rural areas (26.0%). The same contrast in prevalence was noticed for the other HBV markers. In rural areas, HBV infection was more frequently acquired early in infancy, which suggests predominantly perinatal or postnatal transmission. The presence of HBV markers was not significantly associated with a history of blood transfusion, surgery or parenteral injection. High infectivity carriers represented 5.3% and the overall frequency of chronic carriers was 10.4%. These results place Madagascar among areas of high endemicity.

TI Divergence in symbiotic compatibility in a legume-Bradyrhizobium
   mutualism
AB Geographic variation in the mutualism between the legume Amphicarpaea bracteata and its nitrogen-fixing root nodule bacteria (Bradyrhizobium sp.) was analyzed by sampling genotypes from 11 sites separated by distances ranging from 0.6 km to more than 1000 km. Cross inoculation experiments revealed that plants were genetically differentiated in traits determining compatibility with mutualist partners from different sites. Combinations of plant and bacterial genotypes native to the same local habitat yielded 26% higher plant growth relative to non-native combinations (range across 4 experiments; 9% to 48%). Among non-native symbioses, plant growth was unrelated to the geographic distance between sites of plant and bacterial origin. However, compatibility varied significantly with the genetic distance among host populations (inferred by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis): genetically similar plants from separate sites showed superior growth with each other's mutualist partners. Nevertheless, the tree structure of population genetic similarity was not congruent in plants versus bacteria. This implies that adaptive variation in symbiotic compatibility has evolved without strictly parallel divergence in the two species.

TI Local adaptation and gene-for-gene coevolution in a metapopulation model
AB In several reciprocal cross-infection experiments parasites were found to be significantly more adapted to their local host populations than to hosts from distant populations. We developed a metapopulation model, taking explicit account of both population densities and gene frequencies, to determine the influence of ecological and genetical parameters on the local adaptation of the parasites and on the spatial distribution of resistance and virulence genes. Our results point to the predominant effect of ecological parameters such as parasite growth rate and host and parasite migration rates on coevolutionary outcomes. In particular, the parasites are more likely to be adapted to their local host population than to allopatric hosts when the parasite migration rate is larger than the host migration rate. The opposite should be observed whenever hosts migrate more than parasites.

TI Complex non-unique dynamics in simple ecological interactions
AB We report here a host-macroparasite interaction in which several types of attractors may coexist. A proportion of host population is immune to the parasite. The basic attractors observed in this two-species interaction include point equilibria, 2-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 8-cycles, quasicycles, and S-piece and 6-piece chaotic attractors. The attractors depend on the initial population levels as well as on the proportion of immune hosts. Changes in the proportion of immune hosts may either stabilize or destabilize the interaction. The non-uniqueness of the attractors implies that the bifurcation diagrams, or the routes to chaos, may also not be unique, but may depend on the specific initial population level chosen. The basins of attraction, defining the initial conditions leading to a certain type of an attractor, may be fractal sets, even in the case of two non-chaotic attractors. The fractal property observed is the pattern of selfsimilarity. It follows that sensitivity of the trajectory with respect to the initial condition can he observed in the absence of chaos in the dynamics.

TI Population dynamics of a parasite and hyperparasite in a closed system:
   Model analysis and parameter estimation
AB In this paper, we introduce and test models of the dynamics of a parasite and hyperparasite in a closed system from which the parasite's host is excluded. The models are tested against data for the temporal dynamics of a fungal plant parasite of lettuce, Sclerotinia minor, and a fungal hyperparasite, Sporidesmium sclerotivorum. The models are developed by treating the hyperparasite-parasite dynamics as a classical predator-prey system, but then expanding the prey component into a compartmental system of susceptible (uninfected) and infected parasites. The resulting hybrid model enables the separation of the dynamics of susceptible parasites, which are capable of causing disease, and infected parasites, which support reproduction of the hyperparasite. The influence of different functional and numerical responses are compared by analytical results and by parameter estimation.

TI Age-dependent reduction of schistosome fecundity in Schistosoma
   haematobium but not Schistosoma mansoni infections in humans
AB Understanding the dynamics of schistosome infections is problematic because direct measurements of worm burden are not possible. Hitherto, the relative intensity of infection has been estimated by the number of parasite eggs excreted. Egg excretion is assumed to have a consistent relationship with worm burden with duration of infection. We have tested this assumption in Schistosoma mansoni- and S. haematobium-infected populations by looking at the relationships between a circulating parasite antigen, egg excretion level, host age, and parasite density, The study was carried out in two populations because experimental models suggested that S. haematobium but not S. mansoni suffers immune-mediated reduction of fecundity. The results were consistent with this observation, showing that S. mansoni egg output remains stable irrespective of host age or infection intensity while S. haematobium has a substantially reduced egg production with host age. This,information is fundamental to understanding the immunology and epidemiology of human schistosomiasis and thus practical approaches to disease control.

TI Mammary gland neoplasia in long-term rodent studies
AB Breast cancer, the mon frequent spontaneous malignancy diagnosed in women in the western world, is continuously increasing in incidence in industrialized nations. Although breast cancer develops in women as the result of a combination of external and endogenous factors such as exposure to ionizing radiation, diet, socioeconomic status, and endocrinologic, familial, or genetic factors, no specific etiologic agent(s) or the mechanisms responsible of the initiation of the disease has been identified as yet. Thus, experimental models that exhibit the same complex interactions are needed for testing various mechanisms and for assessing the carcinogenic potential of given chemicals. Rodent mammary carcinomas represent such a model to a great extent because, in these species, mammary cancer is a multistep complex process that can be induced by either chemicals, radiation, viruses, or genetic factors, Long-term studies in rodent models have been particularly useful for dissecting the initiation, promotion, and progression steps of carcinogenesis. The susceptibility of the rodent mammary gland to develop neoplasms has made this organ 2 unique target for testing the carcinogenic potential of specific genotoxic chemicals and environmental agents. Mammary tumors induced by indirect- or direct-acting carcinogens such as 7, 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea are, in general, hormone-dependent adenocarcinomas whose incidence, number of tumors per animal, tumor latency, and tumor type are influenced by the age, reproductive history, and endocrinologic milieu of the host at the time of carcinogen exposure. Rodent models are informative in the absence of human data They have provided valuable information on the dose and route of administration to be used and optimal host conditions fbr eliciting maximal tumorigenic response. Studies of the influence of normal gland development on the pathogenesis of chemically induced mammary carcinomas have clarified the role of differentiation in cancer initiation. Comparative studies with the development of the hunan breast and the pathogenesis of breast cancer have contributed to validate rodent-to-human extrapolations. However, it has not been definitively established what type of information is necessary for human risk assessment, whether current toxicity resting methodologies are sufficient for fulfilling those needs, or whether treatment-induced tumorigenic responses in rodents are predictive of potential human risk. An alternative to the traditional bioassays are mechanism-based toxicology and molecular and cellular approaches, combined with comparative in vitro systems. These approaches might allow the rapid screen of chemicals for setting priorities for further studies to determine the dose-response relationship for chemical effects at low doses, to assess effects other than mutagenesis and/or tumorigenesis, or to establish qualitative and quantitative relationships of biomarkers to toxic effects. Until there is enough information on the predictive value of mechanism-based toxicology for risk assessment, this approach should be used in conjunction with and validated by the traditional in vivo long-term bioassays.

TI Parasite infection alters schooling behaviour: Deviant positioning of
   helminth-infected minnows in conspecific groups
AB The formation of polarized swimming groups is a successful antipredator adaptation of many fish species because the confusion created by multiple synchronously moving targets reduces the attack success of predators. However, maintaining synchrony and spatial position within such groups requires the functioning of complex sensory and motor systems, so the ability to school effectively could be sensitive to disease or infection with debilitating parasites. As many predators overcome this confusion by attacking visually distinct individuals in groups, infection-associated traits that impair schooling ability might increase predation on parasitized school members, with consequences for the survival of both host and parasite. We report here on a study designed to investigate the effects of parasite infection on the schooling behaviour of European minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus. Over a series of trials done in a flow-pool, minnows infected with plerocercoid larvae of the cestode Ligula intestinalis consistently exhibited increased nearest neighbour distances when compared with uninfected conspecifics in the same school, suggesting that infected fish may be unable to maintain close spatial positions within schools. Positive relations were found between the area covered by a school and both the nearest neighbour differences of uninfected and infected fish in the school, but these relations differed with infected fish exhibiting increasingly larger nearest neighbour differences than uninfected fish as schools became more dispersed. Infected fish also occupied peripheral positions more often than would have been expected if individuals assorted randomly within schools. Our results indicate that infected fish in schools exhibit positioning behaviour that deviates from that of uninfected conspecifics. As schooling is known to be a primary antipredator response of minnows, the altered behaviour of parasitized individuals within polarized groups could increase their susceptibility to certain predators, with potential consequences for parasite transmission.

TI Human immunodeficiency virus infection dynamics in East Africa deduced
   from surveillance data
AB Knowledge of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) incidence patterns in East African HIV epidemics like that in Uganda is fundamental for guiding interventions and forecasting the future course of the pandemic, yet they are difficult to determine from surveillance data. The authors deduce hypotheses of HIV incidence dynamics from birth cohort analyses of Ugandan acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) incidence from 1987 to 1992 and from the age and sex distribution of sexually transmitted disease: an age dependency far HIV risk; a period effect of varying HIV incidence growth; and a replenishment of HN-susceptible populations through demographic renewal. The hypotheses are tested by incorporating them into a model that generates patterns of HIV incidence, prevalence, and AIDS cases that are consistent with empiric data. When applied to Uganda, the modeled HIV incidence is characterized by a short temporal concentration of high incidence, followed by a decline, stabilization, and concentration in younger ages. The ensuing HIV dynamics result in a rapid build-up and subsequent stabilization of prevalence and mortality in years 10 and 13, respectively, after epidemic onset. When this model is used to forecast scenarios from 1990 to 2000, HIV prevalence declines in some populations, which is different from earlier scenarios. The techniques presented provide an empiric basis to better direct interventions, forecast epidemic impacts, and evaluate determinants of changing incidence and prevalence patterns.

TI Facilitation of Rift Valley fever virus transmission by Plasmodium
   berghei sporozoites in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes
AB Certain mosquito species are susceptible to viral infection but cannot transmit the virus due to a salivary gland barrier. We hypothesized that such species could transmit virus if the mosquito were infected with both virus and malaria parasites. Malaria sporozoites disrupt the integrity of mosquito salivary glands and, in so doing, map destroy salivary gland barriers to viral transmission. To examine this postulate, the model system of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus and a rodent parasite, Plasmodium berghei, in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes was used. Viral trans mission rates for RVF virus-inoculated anophelines that were previously fed either gametocytemic blood (malaria-infected) or normal blood (control) were compared. Viral transmission rates for anophelines having concurrent sporozoite infection of the salivary glands were 32% (n = 25). None of the RVF virus-inoculated control anophelines (n = 55) transmitted virus. These studies confirm an earlier report that malaria sporozoites can disrupt salivary gland barriers and enhance mosquito transmission of arboviruses. Taken together with similar studies using microfilarial parasites, it is increasingly apparent that mosquito-borne parasites have the potential to enhance mosquito transmission of arboviruses.

TI The epidemiology of dengue virus infection among urban, jungle, and
   rural populations in the Amazon region of Peru
AB The first confirmed outbreak of dengue fever in Peru occurred during 1990 in Iquitos, a city of approximately 300,000 residents in the Amazon region. Because of the apparent establishment of endemic transmission of this mosquito-borne viral disease following the outbreak, epidemiologic studies were initiated in 1992. Blood specimens and data on demographic, environmental, and medical history factors were collected from volunteers in an urban sector of Iquitos, in a rural area on the outskirts of Iquitos, and in three nearby jungle communities. A follow-up blood specimen was obtained approximately one year later from a sample of subjects. Sera were tested for dengue IgG antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and specificity was verified using a plaque-reduction neutralization test. Dengue antibody prevalence was 66% in the urban population, 26% in the rural population, and 32-67% in the three jungle areas. A significant association was found between age and antibody prevalence, with a steady increase in prevalence from 18% among subjects less than five years of age to greater than 90% for subjects more than 50 years old. Increased antibody prevalence also was associated with urban and jungle residence and with a piped source of household drinking water. Seroconversions were documented in four of five surveyed communities. These results indicate that dengue virus transmission continues in and around Iquitos and suggest that transmission also occurred prior to the 1990 epidemic.

We studied the effect of Ei,nel-ia arizonensis (Protozoa) on recruitment, winter survival, and change in body mass in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). In field observations, the presence of E. arizonensis was negatively related to recruitment in females and to over-winter survival in males. Experimental manipulation of E. arizonensis in large field enclosures also showed that infection negatively affected over-winter survival of males, There was no relationship between the body mass of deer mice and the presence of either natural or experimental infection. Thus, the mechanism through which E. arizonensis affects survival remains unclear.

AB Evidence for parasite-induced host mortality from field data remains difficult to obtain. We have developed analytical models to investigate the effects of parasite-induced host mortality on the distribution of macroparasites among individual hosts as a function of host age. Under the assumptions of these models, it is shown that a decrease of the mean parasite load or of its dispersion implies that there is parasite-induced host mortality and that infection rate is variable for different hosts in the population. Observed patterns will depend on the nature of such variation and of the relation between parasite load and host mortality.

TI Molecular mechanisms of bacterial virulence: Type III secretion and
   pathogenicity islands
AB Recently, two novel but widespread themes have emerged in the field of bacterial virulence: type III secretion systems and pathogenicity islands. Type III secretion systems, which are found in various gram-negative organisms, are specialized for the export of virulence factors delivered directly to host cells. These factors subvert normal host cell functions in ways that seem beneficial to invading bacteria. The genes encoding several type III secretion systems reside on pathogenicity islands, which are inserted DNA segments within the chromosome that confer upon the host bacterium a variety of virulence traits, such as the ability to acquire iron and to adhere to or enter host cells. Many of these segments of DNA appear to have been acquired in a single step from a foreign source. The ability to obtain complex virulence traits in one genetic event, rather than by undergoing natural selection for many generations, provides a mechanism for sudden radical changes in bacterial-host interactions. Type III secretion systems and pathogenicity islands must have played critical roles in the evolution of known pathogens and are likely to lead to the emergence of novel infectious diseases in the future.

AB A Register of HIV-infected persons who have had a negative antibody test within 3 years of their first antibody positive test (seroconverters) is being set up in the UK to monitor the distribution of times from HIV seroconversion to AIDS (the incubation period) and to death. It will also provide a national resource for use by those designing studies in this group of individuals. Clinicians caring for HIV-positive persons in Genito-Urinary Medicine, Infectious Disease and other departments throughout the UK were asked to participate by providing information on eligible subjects. Most laboratories undertaking HIV antibody testing were also contacted and asked to provide the name of the attending clinician for all seroconverters identified through the HIV laboratory reporting systems of the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) and the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) and for any other seroconverters known to them but not identified by CDSC or SCIEH. Data items sought for the Register include: sex, ethnic group, probable route of HIV transmission, annual CD4 counts, details of therapy and prophylaxis prescribed, AIDS-defining events and vital status. Follow up information is collected annually. Wherever possible, all seroconverters known to a clinic have been identified, whether currently alive or dead, either from clinic records or laboratory reporting or both. The objective is to establish and update a complete register of seroconverters on a long-term basis to provide reliable estimates of the incubation period on which future projections of AIDS cases in the UK can be made.

TI Epidemiological Patterns of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in highly endemic
   areas
AB This paper uses meta-analysis of published data and a deterministic mathematical model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission to describe the patterns of HBV infection in high endemicity areas. We describe the association between the prevalence of carriers and a simple measure of the rate of infection, the age at which half the population have been infected (A(50)), and assess the contribution of horizontal and perinatal transmission to this association. We found that the two main hyper-endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and east Asia have similar prevalences of carriers and values of A(50), and that there is a negative nonlinear relationship between A(50) and the prevalence of carriers in high endemicity areas (Spearman's Rank, P = 0.0086). We quantified the risk of perinatal transmission and the age-dependent rate of infection to allow a comparison between the main hyper-endemic areas. East Asia was found to have higher prevalences of HBeAg positive mothers and a greater risk of perinatal transmission from HBeAg positive mothers than sub-Saharan Africa, though the differences were not statistically significant. However, the two areas have similar magnitudes and age-dependent rates of horizontal transmission. Results of a simple compartmental model suggest that similar rates of horizontal transmission are sufficient to generate the similar patterns between A(50) and the prevalences of carriers. Interrupting horizontal transmission by mass immunization is expected to have a significant, nonlinear impact on the rate of acquisition of new carriers.

TI The evolution of virulence in pathogens with vertical and horizontal
   transmission
AB The idea that vertical transmission of parasites selects for lower virulence is widely accepted. However, little theoretical work has considered the evolution of virulence for parasites with mixed horizontal plus vertical transmission. Many human, animal, and plant parasites are transmitted both vertically and horizontally, and some horizontal transmission is generally necessary to maintain parasites at all. We present a population-dynamical model for the evolution of virulence when both vertical and horizontal transmission are present. In the simplest such model, up to two infectious strains can coexist within one host population. Virulent, vertically transmitted pathogens can persist in a population when they provide protection against more virulent, horizontally transmitted strains. When virulence is maintained by a correlation with horizontal transmission rates, increased levels of vertical transmission always lower the evolutionarily stable (ESS) level of virulence. Contrary to existing theory, however, increases in opportunities for horizontal transmission also lower the ESS level of virulence. We explain these findings in light of earlier work and confirm them in simulations including imperfect vertical transmission. We describe further simulations, in which both vertical and horizontal transmission rates are allowed to evolve. The outcome of these simulations depends on whether high levels of vertical transmission are possible with low virulence. Finally, we argue against the notion of a virulence-avirulence continuum between horizontal and vertical transmission, and discuss our results in relation to empirical studies of transmission and virulence.

AB 1. When parasitoids and pathogens compete for the same host there are often severe costs to the parasitoid. Wasps might be expected, then, to avoid parasitizing pathogen-infected hosts.
   2. When the solitary endoparasitoid Venturia canescens was presented with healthy and granulosis virus-infected larvae of the Indian Meal Moth Plodia interpunctella, it did not exhibit any difference in contact or probing behaviour between healthy and infected hosts.
   3. However, oviposition behaviour was influenced by the level of infection, with a significant reduction in the number of eggs laid in heavily infected hosts.
   4. Transmission of the pathogen did not occur directly through oviposition. However, transmission through contamination of the environment by the parasitoid following oviposition in infected hosts was demonstrated.

TI Analysis of aggregated parasite distributions: A comparison of methods
AB 1. Empirically, parasite distributions are often best described by the negative binomial distribution; some hosts have many parasites while most have just a few. Thus identifying heterogeneities in parasite burdens using conventional parametric methods is problematical. In an attempt to conform to the assumptions of parametric analyses, parasitologists and ecologists frequently log-transform their overdispersed data prior to analysis. In this paper, we compare this method of analysis with an alternative, generalized linear modelling (GLM), approach.
   2. We compare the classical linear model using log-transformed data (Model 1) with two GLMs: one with Poisson errors and an empirical scale parameter (Model 2), and one in which negative binomial errors are explicitly defined (Model 3). We use simulated datasets and empirical data from a long-term study of parasitism in Soay Sheep on St Kilda to test the efficacies of these three statistical models.
   3. We conclude that Model 1 is much more Likely to produce type I errors than either of the two GLMs, and that it also tends to produce more type II errors. Model 3 is only marginally more successful than Model 2, indicating that the use of an empirical scale parameter is only slightly more likely to generate errors than using an explicitly defined negative binomial distribution. Thus, while we strongly recommend the use of GLMs over conventional parametric analyses, either GLM method will serve equally well.

The model simulated the position and infectivity status of the green leafhopper vectors, and the corresponding RTVD infection pattern in a square grid of 324 rice hills, during the first 60 days of crop growth after transplanting.
   2. Based on published information, assumptions were made about rates of virus transmission, vector population dynamics and probability of vector dispersal. Results from a programme of field experiments in the Philippines provided a basis for model testing.
   3. Simulation analysis was used to examine the feasibility of roguing (replacing those plants which show symptoms with healthy plants) as a means of preventing further disease spread. A genetic algorithm was used to evaluate the sensitivity of model output to parameter changes.
   4. Particular parameter combinations were found to be associated with effective roguing. In general, with high or moderate disease pressure, simulated roguing was relatively ineffective even when done frequently and efficiently. With low disease pressure, roguing had a significant effect, but was of little value in such circumstances.

AB Breast-fed infants born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected mothers in Kinshasa, Zaire, were monitored a mean of 18 months. HIV infection in infants was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), HIV culture, or ELISA. PCR test results for HIV DNA on venous blood drawn from children ages 0-2 days and 3-5 months were used to estimate proportions of mother-to-child transmission and transmission risks during the intrauterine, intrapartum/early postpartum, and late postpartum periods. Among 69 HIV-infected children (26% of the cohort), 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14%-35%) were estimated to have had intrauterine, 65% (CI, 53%-76%) intrapartum/early postpartum, and 12% (CI, 5%-22%) late postpartum transmission. The estimated risks for intrauterine, intrapartum/early postpartum, and late postpartum infection, respectively, were 6% (16/261; CI, 4%-10%), 18% (45/245; CI, 14%-24%), acid 4% (8/189; CI, 2%-8%). These results support earlier studies indicating that most transmission occurs during labor and delivery or in the early postpartum period and that the risk of HIV transmission through breast-feeding during the postpartum period is substantial.

   virus infection
AB Risks for sexually transmitted disease (STD) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been addressed in two categories: the individual and the population. Emphasis in STD and HIV prevention has largely been placed on the first, with interventions that address individuals and attempt to bring about changes in individuals being the norm. The relative ease of evaluating these interventions and the ability to know that they have been delivered as intended make these interventions attractive. Community interventions are more difficult to manage and to evaluate but are nonetheless commonly used. Structural interventions that address the environment in which risk behavior takes place are also possible but used much less frequently. In a comprehensive intervention program for STD and HIV prevention, it is necessary to consider opportunities for all three types of intervention approaches.

TI Personal risk taking and the spread of disease: Beyond core groups
AB Disease control efforts directed at human immunodeficiency virus are predicated on the need to reduce personal risk behaviors; that approach may not adequately reflect the complicated interplay between personal behaviors and the social setting in which they occur. Efforts to date, including the application of population ecology, the development of the core group hypothesis, and the use of compartment models to describe disease transmission, have aided in understanding the dynamics of transmission and have highlighted the relationship between personal risk taking and population risk. An area for further development is the application of the techniques of social network analysis to infectious disease spread. Initial work suggests that social structure may act as a barrier (or facilitator) in disease transmission and that the epidemiologic impact of a risky act varies with the social setting. The local context for risk behaviors has important implications for the dynamics of transmission.

TI Population- and individual-based approaches to the design and analysis
   of epidemiologic studies of sexually transmitted disease transmission
AB Epidemiologic studies of sexually transmitted disease (STD) transmission present a number of unique challenges in design and analysis. These arise both from the social nature of STD transmission and from inherent difficulties in collecting accurate and informative data on exposure and infection. Risk of acquiring an STD depends on both individual-level factors and the behavior and infectiousness of others. Consequently, study designs and analysis methods developed for studying chronic disease risk in individuals or groups may not apply directly. Simple models of STD transmission were used to investigate these issues, focusing on how the interplay between individual- and population-level factors influences design and interpretation of epidemiologic studies, with particular attention to interpretation of common measures of association and to common sources of bias in epidemiologic data. Existing methods for investigating risk factors can be modified such that these issues may be addressed directly.

TI The dynamic topology of sexually transmitted disease epidemics:
   Implications for prevention strategies
AB Each sexually transmitted disease (STD) epidemic evolves through predictable phases, shaped by a dynamic interplay among the pathogen, the behaviors of the subpopulations in which it emerges, and the prevention efforts that are developed to limit its impact. As STD epidemics move through these phases, the sexual and social networks that fuel them become located in subpopulations characterized by progressively higher rates of sex partner change and less contact with the health care system. As a result, phase-appropriate prevention strategies and research issues are essential to reducing STDs and their consequences.

TI Dynamics and control of Schistosoma haematobium transmission in Kenya:
   An overview of the Msambweni project
AB Ecologic modeling of Schistosoma transmission in endemic communities has suggested that antiparasite therapy targeted at the most heavily infected segment of the human population (i.e., school-age children) should have a significant impact on local parasite transmission. Our 1984-1991 experience with age-targeted therapy in the Msambweni area of Kenya has shown an overall decrease in area transmission within 1-2 years following initiation of annual treatment of school-age groups. Snail monitoring confirmed a continuing but variable reduction of vector infection rates. However, subgroup analysis showed significant differences in transmission suppression between more developed coastal villages with piped-water kiosks and villages with only limited access to safe water supplies. Villages without piped water were marked by higher initial prevalences of S. haematobium infection, greater prevalence among adults, longer and more frequent contact with high-risk water sources, and persistently high transmission despite compliance with parasitologic screening or drug therapy. We conclude that targeted therapy had a significant impact on S. haematobium transmission in some areas, but that more extensive or more prolonged coverage is necessary to reduce the rate of new infection in high-risk villages. Defining held-use algorithms, based on decision analysis of economic and ecologic parameters, should provide effective guidelines for selective versus mass treatment in expanded control areas.

TI Different approaches to modeling the cost-effectiveness of
   schistosomiasis control
AB The limited economic resources available for health care in developing countries necessitates the involvement of cost analysis in the planning of any control intervention. A number of studies have undertaken cost-effectiveness analysis of schistosomiasis control, and the methodologies utilized in both cost and effectiveness evaluation are discussed. In attempting to relate cost to effectiveness, most studies have utilized static models expressing effectiveness in terms of coverage (drug delivery) or cure rate (infection prevalence reduction). These immediate output measures do not consider the long-term impact of control nor the effect on disease. An alternative approach is to use a model of the transmission dynamics of the parasite to permit evaluation of the long-term impact of control. An example of a population dynamic approach to cost-effectiveness analysis that can assess the impact of treatment on infection and disease due to the intestinal nematodes is presented to illustrate the potential of this approach in modeling the cost-effectiveness of schistosomiasis control.

TI Hunting of peridomestic rodents and consumption of their meat as
   possible risk factors for rodent-to-human transmission of Lassa virus in
   the Republic of Guinea
AB In this population-based study, we correlated possible risk factors for rodent-to-human transmission of Lassa virus with markers of Lassa fever in two different regions of the Republic of Guinea (Prefectures of Pita and Gueckedou). Antibody prevalence was 2.6% (6 of 232) in Pita compared with 14.0% (105 of 751) in Gueckedou, with up to 35.0% seropositivity in selected villages of the higher prevalence area. We observed three major risk factors in Gueckedou favoring Lassa virus transmission: rodent infestation was much higher food was more often stored uncovered and most strikingly, peridomestic rodents were hunted as a protein source by 91.5% of the population as opposed to 0% in Pita. To control for the confounding effects of differences in rodent infestation and food storage, rodent consumption was analyzed as a risk factor for transmission of Lassa virus comparing rodent consumers (RC) and nonconsumers (NC) in Gueckedou only: 14.6% of RC had Lassa virus antibodies versus 7.4% of NC (P = 0.1) and 23.0% of RC reported a history of a febrile illness with hearing loss (the most common sequel of Lassa fever) versus 6.1% of NC (P = 0.003).

TI Parasite-mediated competition: A model of directly transmitted
   macroparasites
AB There is growing interest in host-parasite ecology, particularly with regard to the effect of parasites on host community structure, but few studies have explored the theory of parasite mediation of host competition. I developed a model to examine the impact of directly transmitted macroparasites on the competition and population dynamics of two sympatric host species. Several important features of macroparasite-mediated competition are considered in the model: the two host species compete in a classical Lotka-Volterra manner, the parasite influences the survivorship and reproduction of both hosts, and parasites exhibit aggregated distribution among host populations. The conditions for host coexistence were derived explicitly. The results suggest that host intrinsic growth rate, host carrying capacity, susceptibility, parasite pathogenicity, and the magnitude of parasite aggregation are important components influencing host coexistence. Parasites may enhance or disrupt host coexistence, depending on the relationships of these parameter values. If the individuals of the inferior species are less susceptible to infection than the individuals of superior species and/or exhibit less pathology, the inferior competitor will bear a competitive advantage, resulting in either stable coexistence or competitive exclusion. In contrast, parasites may cause more rapid extinction of the inferior species if the inferior species is more susceptible to and/or less tolerant of parasite infection. When two host species are equally susceptible to infection and parasites are equally pathogenic, parasites may still have significant consequences on the competitive outcome. Sensitivity analysis suggests that an increased degree of parasite aggregation among hosts reduces the ability of parasites to regulate host populations and decreases parasite equilibrium density. Finally, micro- and macroparasite models are compared.

TI Suboptimal virulence of an insect-parasitic nematode
AB Recent considerations of parasite virulence have focused on the adverse effects that parasites can have on the survival of their hosts. Many parasites, however, reduce host fitness by an equally deleterious but different means, by causing partial or complete sterility of their hosts. A model of optimal parasite virulence is developed in which a quantity of host resources can be allocated to either host or parasite reproduction. Increases in parasite reproduction thus cause reductions in host fertility. The model shows that under a wide variety of ecological conditions, such parasites should completely sterilize their hosts. Only when opportunities for horizontal transmission are very limited should the parasites appropriate less than all of a host's reproductive resources. Field and laboratory evidence shows that the nematode parasite Howardula aoronymphium is relatively avirulent to one of its principal host species, Drosophila falleni, whereas it is much more virulent to D. putrida and D. neotestacea, suggesting that there may be substantial vertical transmission in D. falleni. However, epidemiological studies in the held and laboratory assays of host specificity strongly suggest that the three host species share a single parasite pool in natural populations, indicating that parasites in all three host species experience high levels of horizontal transmission. Thus, the low virulence of H. aoronymphium to D. falleni is not consistent with the model of optimal parasite virulence. It is proposed that this suboptimal virulence in D. falleni is a consequence of populations of H. aoronymphium being selected to exploit simultaneously several different host species. As a result, virulence may not be optimal in any one host. One must, therefore, consider the full range of host species in assessing a parasite's virulence.

TI The geography of coevolution: Comparative population structures for a
   snail and its trematode parasite
AB Gene flow and the genetic structure of host and parasite populations are critical to the coevolutionary process, including the conditions under which antagonistic coevolution favors sexual reproduction. Here we compare the genetic structures of different populations of a freshwater New Zealand snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) with its trematode parasite (Microphallus sp.) using allozyme frequency data. Allozyme variation among snail populations was found to be highly structured among lakes; but for the parasite there was little allozyme structure among Lake populations, suggesting much higher levels of parasite gene flow. The overall pattern of variation was confirmed with principal component analysis, which also showed that the organization of genetic differentiation for the snail (but not the parasite) was strongly related to the geographic arrangement of lakes. Some snail populations from different sides of the Alps near mountain passes were more similar to each other than to other snail populations on the same side of the Alps. Furthermore, genetic distances among parasite populations were correlated with the genetic distances among host populations, and genetic distances among both host and parasite populations were correlated with ''stepping-stone'' distances among lakes. Hence, the host snail and its trematode parasite seem to be dispersing to adjacent lakes in a stepping-stone fashion, although parasite dispersal among lakes is clearly greater. High parasite gene Bow should help to continuously reintroduce genetic diversity within local populations where strong selection might otherwise isolate ''host races.'' Parasite gene Bow can thereby facilitate the coevolutionary (Red Queen) dynamics that confer an advantage to sexual reproduction by restoring lost genetic variation.

TI Evaluating the effects of a biopesticide on populations of the
   variegated grasshopper, Zonocerus variegatus
AB 1. A field trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an oil formulation of the fungal entomopathogen, Metarhizium flavoviride, for control of the variegated grasshopper, Zonocerus variegatus. The results of the trial showed a significant reduction in grasshopper populations following spray application compared with non-treated controls.
   2. Further studies revealed that there was significant movement of insects into and out of the treated plots during the course of the experiment, and that the pathogen spray residue remained infective for several days after application.
   3. To help interpret these data and link them more closely to the basic population counts, insect-pathogen models were developed which accounted for the effects of secondary pick up of spores, insect movement and mortality on disease levels observed in the field. These revealed that contact with spores from the spray residue was an important route of infection for insects moving into the treated areas after spraying. They also revealed that there was an increase in disease incubation periods in the field compared with the laboratory; this slowed mortality rates.
   4. Overall, the combination of laboratory, field and theoretical studies suggested that the total impact of the M. flavoviride-based biopesticide was very high. This combination of techniques revealed considerably more information than the individual indicators of efficacy commonly used to assess biopesticide applications. As such, this study demonstrates how basic ecological approaches can be of value in an applied context, helping to provide a link between laboratory and field studies, and aiding the interpretation of complex field trial results.

TI Mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in wild songbirds: The spread of a new
   contagious disease in a mobile host population
AB A new mycoplasmal conjunctivitis was first reported in wild house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) in early 1994. The causative agent was identified as Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), a nonzoonotic pathogen of poultry that had not been associated with disease in wild songbirds. Since the initial observations of affected house finches in the mid-Atlantic region, the disease has become widespread and has been reported throughout the eastern United States and Canada. By late 1995, mycoplasmal conjunctivitis had spread to an additional species, the American goldfinch (Carduelis tristis). This new disease exemplifies the rapid spread of a pathogen following introduction into a mobile wildlife population and provides lessons that may apply to emerging human diseases.

TI Parent-offspring regression suggests heritable susceptibility to
   ectoparasites in a natural population of kittiwake Rissa tridactyla
AB Little information is available on the genetic variability of host susceptibility to parasites in natural populations despite its importance for the understanding of the evolution of host-parasite interactions. A long-term demographic and epidemiologic survey of a seabird population allowed us to investigate the potential correlation between parent and offspring ectoparasite load, while controlling for various environmental factors. In particular, parasite loads were measured for all individuals (i.e., parents and offspring) when they were nestlings and the effect of the year and breeding cliff were taken into account. The positive correlation found between parent and offspring parasite loads suggests a heritable susceptibility to ectoparasitism by ticks in this host population and that this character has the potential to respond to natural selection.

TI Greater Yellowstone's bison: Unraveling of an early American wildlife
   conservation achievement
AB The Greater Yellowstone region's bison-brucellosis controversy has triggered troublesome proposals giving federal and state agriculture agencies jurisdiction over wildlife to eradicate a domestic livestock disease. Many of the region's bison (Bos bison) and elk (Cervus elaphus) carry the bacterium Brucella abortus, which can cause brucellosis. Local livestock officials fear bison and elk could transmit brucellosis to domestic livestock. jeopardizing state brucellosis class-free status. However, no cases of such transmission in an open range setting have been verified scientifically. Various federal and state agencies have jurisdiction over the region's wildlife and livestock; these agencies are having real difficulty reaching consensus on how to address brucellosis in the wildlife populations. Montana and Idaho recently vested state livestock officials with jurisdiction over bison leaving Yellowstone National Park (YNP), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal, Plant, and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has indicated it may propose regulations asserting jurisdiction over bison. An interim bison management plan, the result of a recent court settlement, provides for the National Park Service (NPS) to participate in capturing, testing, and slaughtering Yellowstone's bison, but makes no provision for addressing brucellosis in elk. The region's brucellosis problem could be adequately addressed through a risk management disease control policy rather than a costly and perhaps fruitless eradication effort. Such an approach can be implemented without the unwelcome precedent of livestock officials taking jurisdiction over wildlife.

TI Multigenic drug resistance among inbred malaria parasites
AB Recent population genetic studies on the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have confirmed that selfing is more frequent where the transmission rate is lower; with inbreeding coefficients estimated to be 0.33 and 0.92 for sites in Tanzania and Papua New Guinea (PNG), respectively. These geographical differences in Plasmodium mating patterns have been linked to the rate of spread of chloroquine resistance (CQR) which, according to some measures, has been slower in Tanzania than in PNG. It has been proposed that the former observation explains the latter, although the theoretical argument linking the two is based on limited simulation studies. Taking a more analytical approach here, we first establish the relevant relationship between the coefficient of inbreeding (F, within loci) and the recombination race (r, between loci), defining an 'effective recombination rate', (r) over tilde = r-(1-F). We then show that the em of multigenic drug resistance can indeed be slowed (or even quickened) by more outcrossing, but only when resistance is determined by two or more genes, none of which independently confers significant protection. The resistance genes should both be initially rare, and subject to low selection pressure. The analysis does not completely discount the hypothesis that inbreeding significantly influences the spread of CQR, but we show that it can only do so under a restrictive set of conditions, and that these conditions are not satisfied by some laboratory and field data. We discuss some of the wider implications of these results for the evolution of multigenic resistance.

TI Development and evaluation of a health education intervention against
   Taenia solium in a rural community in Mexico
AB A comprehensive study was undertaken in a rural community in the state of Morelos, Mexico to evaluate health education as an intervention measure against Taenia solium. An educational program was developed to promote recognition and knowledge of the transmission of the parasite and to improve hygienic behavior and sanitary conditions that foster transmission. The effects of educational intervention were evaluated by measuring changes in knowledge and practices and prevalence of human taeniasis and swine cysticercosis before and after the campaign. The health education strategy was implemented with the active participation of the population based on the information obtained from a sociologic study. A questionnaire was designed and used before, immediately after the intervention, and six months later. Statistically significant improvements occurred in knowledge of the parasite, its life cycle, and how it is acquired by humans; however, changes in behavior related to transmission were less dramatic and persistent. The prevalences of cysticercosis in pigs at the start of the education intervention were 2.6% and 5.2% by lingual examination and antibody detection (immunoblot assay), respectively, and approximately one year after the intervention they were 0% and 1.2% (P < 0.05). These changes were accompanied by significant reductions in the reported access of pigs to sources of infection and freedom to roam. We conclude that health education, developed along with community involvement, reduced opportunities for transmission of T. solium in the human-pig cycle.

AB We have compared allelic polymorphism of two merozoite surface protein genes, MSP-1 and MSP-2, of Plasmodium falciparum and the parasite load in infected individuals in two villages in east Africa. In Michenga village in Tanzania, malaria is holoendemic and transmission is perennial; in Asar village in Sudan, malaria is mesoendemic and transmission is markedly seasonal. The numbers of alleles of both genes were found to be much greater in Michenga than in Asar. More parasite clones exhibiting higher allelic polymorphisms of the genes studied were carried by infected inhabitants in Michenga than those in Asar. The high mean number of clones in Michenga is associated with a very high frequency of out-crossing compared with that estimated in Asar.

TI Oropouche virus transmission in the Amazon River basin of Peru
AB Seroepidemiologic studies were conducted to determine the prevalence of Oropouche (ORO) viral antibody, risk factors, and the incidence of infection among residents of the Amazon region of Peru. Blood samples, as well as demographic, cultural, and medical history data, were collected from residents in a sector of the city of Iquitos and in an adjacent rural and three neotropical rain forest communities. Blood specimens were obtained approximately one year later from a cohort of the same study subjects who were negative for ORO antibody on the initial cross-sectional survey. Sera were tested for ORO IgG antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody prevalences were 35% for residents of the urban population, 24-46% for the forest communities, and 18% for the rural community. Antibody prevalence increased with age, and subjects who were seropositive were significantly (P = 0.001) older (mean = 33 years) than the seronegative subjects (mean = 15 years). Multivariate analysis revealed that only age, urban and forest residence, and occupation as a farmer or housekeeper remained significantly associated with seropositivity. Seroconversion data for the same populations one year later demonstrated evidence of ORO viral infection among 28% of the residents in the rural community and 2% or less in the forest and urban communities. Oropouche virus infection was significantly associated with older age (P = 0.04) in the rural community (P < 0.001). These data support prior evidence of ORO viral infection among residents of Iquitos and surrounding villages and suggest that transmission of this virus occurs continuously in the population of this area of the Amazon basin.

TI Transmission and distribution of virus serotypes: African horse sickness
   in zebra
AB The prevalence of African horse sickness (AHS) serotypes in zebra foals from the Kruger National Park, South Africa was examined for possible associations between serotypes and to estimate the basic reproduction number, R(0). The distributions of serotypes between zebra were not independent in the 6- and 7-8-month-old age classes (P < 0.005). This does not necessarily imply biological interactions between serotypes, as heterogeneity in host-vector transmission rates can generate non-independent distributions of serotypes. Both age and month of capture were significant factors in the number of serotypes infecting each zebra (P < 0.0001). Pairwise, positive associations between non-cross-reacting serotypes were found in the 7-8-month-old class only. For AHS overall, estimates of R(0) ranged from 31-68. Assuming serotypes are transmitted independently, estimates of R(0) for individual serotypes ranged from 10 for serotype 1 to 23 for serotype 6. The wide range of estimates emphasizes the need for a better understanding of serotype transmission and interactions in AHS.

TI Wolbachia infection in Drosophila simulans: Does the female host bear a
   physiological cost?
AB Fitness traits of three Drosophila simulans strains infected by endocellular bacteria belonging to the genus Wolbachia have been compared with those of replicate stocks previously cured from the infection by an antibiotic treatment. The traits measured were development time, egg-to-adult viability, egg hatch, productivity, fecundity, and the number of functional ovarioles. Individuals of the first strain were bi-infected by two Wolbachia variants, wHa and wNo. The second strain was infected by wHa, the third one by wNo. The Wolbachia studied here cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), a high embryonic mortality (70% to > 90%) when an infected male is crossed with an uninfected female. Three generations after antibiotic treatment, we observed in all strains a significant drop in productivity in the cured stocks. This drop was not due to antibiotic toxicity and was associated with the loss of the Wolbachia. However the effect had disappeared in two of the three strains five generations after treatment, and could not be found in the third strain in a third measurement carried out 14 generations after treatment. The temporary nature of the productivity difference indicates that Wolbachia do not enhance productivity in infected strains. On the other hand, in all traits measured, our results show the absence of any negative effects of the Wolbachia on their host. This could be explained when considering Wolbachia evolution, as maternally transmitted parasites bear a strong selective pressure not to harm their female host. However, CI would allow the bacteria to be maintained even when harming the female. The apparent absence of deleterious effects caused by these Wolbachia might result from a trade-off, where a relatively low bacteria density would advantage the Wolbachia by suppressing any deleterious effects on the female host, at the cost of a weaker maternal transmission rate of the infection.

TI Unimmunized gypsy populations and implications for the eradication of
   poliomyelitis in Europe
AB The certification of poliomyelitis eradication in Europe will eventually require that countries demonstrate there is a minimal risk of wild poliovirus reintroduction and sustained transmission through unimmunized subpopulations such as ethnic minorities. A serologic survey among a Gypsy community in Italy found that despite only 26% documented immunization coverage, serum neutralizing antibodies to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were detected in 81%, 94%, and 63% of the 86 persons studied. While the high level of immunity found in this community may have been due to secondary spread of vaccine virus, the possibility of unrecognized circulation of wild polioviruses cannot be excluded. Targeted immunization of such groups may be the most efficient means of eliminating the risk of importation-associated outbreaks.

TI Progress toward global polio eradication
AB Significant progress is being made towards the global eradication of poliomyelitis by the year 2000. The strategies recommended by the World Health Organization for polio eradication are as follows: maintaining high routine immunization coverage; conducting nationwide mass immunization campaigns; building effective, laboratory-based surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis; and conducting localized immunization campaigns directed at the final reservoirs of virus transmission. Sixty-three countries have conducted nationwide anti-polio immunization campaigns. Three hundred million children were immunized in these campaigns worldwide in 1995. The reported incidence of poliomyelitis has fallen by similar to 80% since the global target was set in 1988, and the geographic range of polio is being restricted. The major challenges for achieving eradication are establishing effective surveillance systems in all countries and mobilizing the resources needed to fully implement the recommended strategies in the 67 countries in which polio remains endemic.

On 23 August 1991, a 2-year-old boy with acute flaccid paralysis due to wild poliovirus was detected in Junin, Peru, the last isolation of such a virus in the entire Western Hemisphere. In 1990, an International Commission for the Certification of Eradication of Poliomyelitis Eradication (ICCPE) was established by the Pan American Health Organization to eventually determine if transmission was interrupted. After 3 years of follow-up and review of surveillance data, the ICCPE declared that wild poliovirus transmission had been interrupted in the Americas.

TI Polio eradication: Surveillance implications for the United Kingdom
AB The requirements for certification of elimination of wild virus poliomyelitis will pose particular problems for some industrialized countries, such as the United Kingdom, where there has been no case detected for at least a decade. Systems of surveillance of poliomyelitis have been reviewed and potential weaknesses identified. When oral polio vaccine is routinely used, the rate of vaccine-associated cases provides an indication of the likelihood that if they occurred, wild virus cases would be detected. Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance was done for 3 years, but rates were lower than reported elsewhere and were accepted for certification purposes. Alternative techniques, such as surveillance of polioviruses, either in clinical samples or from the environment, may be developed in such countries. The ability to identify enteroviruses and to distinguish between wild and vaccine strains of polioviruses will give assurance that silent transmission of wild viruses is unlikely.

TI A test of heterogeneous mixing as a mechanism for ecological persistence
   in a disturbed environment
AB Persistence is a central issue in population ecology with important implications for population management. Most theoretical studies have focused on continually interacting populations, even though many systems are subject to ecological disturbances which confound analysis of persistence. In this paper, we use a combination of a simple parasite-hyperparasite model with disturbances and field data to investigate the factors contributing to the observed persistence of the parasite population. The field data are taken from a two-year experiment (including five growing seasons) investigating the use of the mycoparasite Sporidesmium sclerotivorum as a persistent biological control agent of Sclerotinia minor, an economically important fungal parasite of lettuce. We show that the standard assumption of homogeneous mixing fails to predict the observed persistence of the parasite population. We demonstrate that allowing for heterogeneous mixing prevents the fade-out predicted in the homogeneous mixing case. The implications of the results for broad classes of host-parasite systems are discussed.

TI Host-parasite coevolution: Comparative evidence for covariation of life
   history traits in primates and oxyurid parasites
AB The environmental factors that drive the evolution of parasite life histories are mostly unknown. Given that hosts provide the principal environmental features parasites have to deal with, and given that these features (such as resource availability and immune responses) are well characterized by the life history of the host, we may expect natural selection to result in covariation between parasite and host life histories. Moreover, some parasites show a high degree of host specificity, and cladistic analyses have shown that host and parasite phylogenies can be highly congruent. These considerations suggest that parasite and host life histories may covary. The central argument in the theory of life history evolution concerns the existence of trade-offs between traits. For parasitic nematodes it has been shown that larger body sizes induce higher fecundity, but this is achieved at the expense of delayed maturity. As high adult mortality would select for reduced age at maturity, the selective benefit of increased fecundity is expressed only if adult mortality is low. Parasite adult mortality may depend on a number of factors, including host longevity. Here we tested the hypothesis concerning the positive covariation between parasite body size (which reflects parasite longevity) and host longevity. To achieve this goal, we used the association between the pinworms (Oxyuridae, Nematoda) and their primate hosts. Oxyurids are highly host specific and are supposed to be involved in a coevolutionary process with their hosts. We found that female parasite body length was positively correlated with host longevity after correcting for phylogeny and host body mass. Conversely, male parasite body length and host longevity were not correlated. These results confirm that host longevity may represent a constraint on the evolution of body size in oxyurids, at least in females. The discrepancy between female and male oxyurids is likely to depend on the particular mode of reproduction of this taxon (haplodiploidy), which should result in weak (or even null) selection pressures to an increase of body size in males.

AB Using an indirect immunofluorescence assay on stool samples, we found a 6.4% prevalence of cryptosporidiosis among 403 children less than five years of age with acute diarrhea in Mexico City over a one-year period. The prevalence was highest (11.4%) during the rainy summer months. Most Cryptosporidium parvum cases occurred in infants less than one year of age. Cryptosporidium parvum was more common in malnourished children (P < 0.05) and in nonbreast-fed infants less than six months of age (P < 0.01). Neither dwelling characteristics nor the presence of domestic animals at home were associated with C. parvum infection. Enteropathogenic bacteria were found in 26.8% of the children; Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella being the most frequently identified. None of 100 serum samples tested showed antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus. When compared with immunofluorescence, the acid-fast technique showed a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 98.9%, with a predictive positive value of 83.3%. It was concluded that 1) monoclonal antibody-based immunofluorescence is a better diagnostic tool than the acid-fast technique, 2) the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in this population was similar to that of other developing countries, 3) clinical manifestations were nonspecific, and 4) C. parvum was more common in malnourished children and in nonbreast-fed infants.

Antibody occurred in 11% of 928 deer mice, 20% of 355 brush mice, 23% of 35 western harvest mice, and 12% of 24 Mexican voles. No infected deer mice were found in desert habitat; prevalence varied from 4% in chaparral to 17% in pinyon-juniper. Brush mice were frequently infected in chaparral and montane forest (25%). Seropositivity was higher in males and in heavier animals, suggesting horizontal transmission among adult males. Decreasing prevalence with age among the youngest deer mice suggests that infected dams confer passive immunity to pups.

TI Sexual transmission of disease and host mating systems: Within-season
   reproductive success
AB While there is an extensive literature on the evolution of mating systems in animals, little consideration has been given to the possible evolutionary interactions between sexually transmitted pathogens and the mating systems of their hosts. We use individual-based models that incorporate measurable per-contact probabilities of infection and fertilization to show that not only can the presence of sexually transmitted (and sterilizing) pathogen have significant effects on optimal within-season mating strategies for both males and females. We show that, contrary to expectations, monogamy is not always predicted to be the optimal strategy. The optimal strategy may also often differ between the two sexes, and the optimal strategy will not always be the one that minimizes disease transmission. Similarly, we show that the optimal level of virulence for a sexually transmitted pathogen is a function of the degree of promiscuity of its host. Overall, these results suggest that sexually transmitted diseases can impact host mating behavior, often in nonintuitive directions.

TI Tachinid parasitoids affect host plant choice by caterpillars to
   increase caterpillar survival
AB Current models of parasite-host interactions generally emphasize considerations of parasite virulence and parasite transmission rather than host responses to attack. We describe a situation in which parasitism causes a host to change its feeding behavior and this change improves the expected fitness of the host and probably the fitness of its parasites. We have found that a tachinid parasitoid (Thelaira americana) often emerges from its caterpillar host (Platyprepia virginalis) without killing the host. Whether the host caterpillar survives its parasites depends in part on what it has been eating. Unparasitized caterpillars were more likely to survive to adulthood when feeding on lupine, whereas parasitized caterpillars were more likely to survive on poison hemlock. Development time and pupal masses of caterpillars (both parasitized and unparasitized) were not found to be affected by the host plants that they fed on. Survival of fly larvae in caterpillars that we determined were parasitized using ultrasound was not affected by host plant. However, fly pupae that emerged from caterpillars that had been reared on hemlock were heavier than those emerging from lupine-fed caterpillars. This was due primarily to the direct effect of diet on the flies and less so to the indirect benefit to flies whose host caterpillars survived their parasites by feeding on hemlock.
   Parasitized caterpillars were more likely to select hemlock, and unparasitized caterpillars were more likely to select lupine when offered both host plants in field tests. These results were consistent for the two years that the choice experiments were conducted. These results were also consistent with the hypothesis that caterpillars change their food plant choices so as to increase their conditional success.
   Conditional food choices that increase success depending upon parasite load are well accepted for humans, controversial for other primates, and unknown for insects. If caterpillars alter their host plant choices as a result of their parasite load, then this phenomenon could help to explain the evolution of host plant choices that have defied explanation in the past. Such a suggestion assumes that nonlethal parasitism is a common phenomenon. We believe that this may be the case since we did not detect the nonlethal nature of this interaction until we began the unconventional practice of rearing in the field. Other workers have described nonlethal parasitism for several tachinid-host systems, and many families of flies are similar to tachinids except that their hosts are vertebrates; these interactions are nonlethal. Future empirical work, as well as models of parasite-host interactions, should consider the possibility that hosts alter their plant choices depending upon their parasite loads.

TI Prevalence, host specificity and impact on host fecundity of
   microparasites and epibionts in three sympatric Daphnia species
AB 1. Recent reports indicate that microparasites might play an important role in the ecology and evolution of freshwater zooplankton. To quantify the Impact of parasitism on Daphnia in natural populations we studied the microparasites of D. magna, D. pulex and D. longispina in three ponds in southern England for a 1-year period. Parasite prevalence and richness, epibiont prevalence and density of host food (planktonic algae) were quantified and their effect on host fecundity analysed.
   2. Seventeen parasite species were detected, including eight microsporidia, one haplosporidium, one ameoba, three fungi, three bacteria and one unidentified parasite. The mean proportion of infected adults across the year and the three ponds was 84.7% for D. magna, 53.6% for D. pulex and 38.6% for D. longispina for the 11 most common parasites. Body size was generally positively correlated with parasite prevalence and richness. This relation was found both across and within host species. Multiple infections by different parasite species were common.
   3. In all three Daphnia species, parasitism was associated with a reduction in fecundity. The small D. longispina was less affected per parasite compared to the two larger host species, D. magna and D. pulex. Clutch presence was more strongly reduced than clutch size, and the effect increased with parasite richness. The data suggest that parasites castrated their host completely, rather than reducing clutch size.
   4. Host specificity varied between parasite species. Two parasite species infected only one or two of the three hosts investigated, and six parasite species showed differences in their specificity between ponds.
   5. Four different epibiont groups were distinguished; algae, Protozoa, one fungus and one bacterium. Epibiont prevalence differed between ponds and species. Overall, epibionts were not host specific, but intensity of infection differed strongly between species and the three ponds. Epibiont infection was independent of parasite infection. The presence of epibiontic algae reduced clutch size in D. magna significantly.
   6. Our results suggest that parasites can have important effects on Daphnia ecology and evolution. Differential susceptibility of the three host species to parasites suggests that parasites might play a role in determining competition and coexistence in our three study sites.

TI Interactive effects of sublethal nematodes and nutritional status on
   snowshoe hare vulnerability to predation
AB 1. We studied the effect of parasitism on snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) survival through a field experiment that reduced natural burdens of sublethal nematodes in a free-ranging hare population. We treated half the hares on each of six study areas year-round with an anthelminthic drug, and the other half with a placebo. Potential interactive effects of parasitism and nutrition were examined by supplementing the natural food supply on three of the six study areas during two winters. Survival was measured by radio-collaring a total of 612 hares with mortality-sensitive transmitters and monitoring survival daily between April 1991 and June 1993.
   2. Overall, nematode burdens in hares were highest between March and October, and Obeliscoides cuniculi was the most abundant of the five species present. The proximate cause of 95% of mortalities (n = 318) during the study was predation. Predators killed hares with heavy burdens of O. cuniculi disporportionately during May-June, but burdens of the four other species (Nematodirus triangularis, Trichuris leporis, Dirofilaria scapiceps, Protostrongylus boughtoni) were similar between predator-killed hares and the live population.
   3. During May-October 1991, the anthelminthic treatment did not affect hare survival, but during May-October 1992 survival of parasite-reduced hares was 2.4-times higher than that of controls. During November 1991-April 1992 survival of food supplemented hares was 21% higher than food-normal animals, but survival was similar during November 1992-April 1993.
   4. The effect of parasite-reduction on hare survival was apparently contingent on overwinter food supplies between November 1991 and April 1992, with survival being highest in hares subjected to both treatments, intermediate in those receiving only food supplementation, and lowest in unfed hares. We conclude that the effect of sublethal nematode parasitism on hare survival can be important if interactive with predation, and that synergistic effects of parasitism and nutrition may affect hares if food availability is limited.

TI Can sublethal parasitism destabilize predator-prey population dynamics?
   A model of snowshoe hares, predators and parasites
AB 1. Snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations typically exhibit 8-11 year cycles in abundance over most of their geographic range. Results of a parasite-reduction study suggest that sublethal effects of nematode infections may increase the vulnerability of hares to predation. We explored the potential role of parasite-induced vulnerability to predation in promoting hare population cycles using models of hare, predator and parasite dynamics. Results of long-term studies of hare populations were used to estimate most model parameters.
   2. To ensure the generality of our results, we analysed three different models of increasing complexity. The basic model gave a simple description of the dynamics of hares, predators and parasites. The second model added a Type II predator functional response and parasite density-dependent reproduction. The final model added a time delay in hare natality and age structure in the predator population.
   3. In all three models, adding parasites to the hare-predator system made the population dynamics less stable. This demonstrates that parasite-induced vulnerability to predation acts in a destabilizing fashion and makes population cycles more likely.
   4. To compare with a sublethal parasite that only acts through parasite-induced vulnerability to predation, we constructed a model with a hypothetical parasite that only affects hare natality. Although parasite-induced reductions in natality could in some cases destabilize the population dynamics, the effect was always weaker than the effect of parasite-induced vulnerability to predation. This highlights an important feature of parasite-induced vulnerability to predation. When the dynamics of both predator and parasite are coupled to those of the hare, roughly synchronous cycles occur in predator densities and parasite burdens. Because predators and parasites act multiplicatively on the predation rate, the synchronous cycles in predator densities and parasite burdens create a synergistic effect that destabilizes hare-predator-parasite population dynamics.

TI Isoenzyme diversity in Pneumocystis carinii from rats, mice, and rabbits
AB Pneumocystis carinii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. To investigate the genetic diversity of P. carinii populations, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis was used to analyze five enzyme systems (malate dehydrogenase, glucose phosphate isomerase, leucine aminopeptidase, malic enzyme, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase). Only five different multilocus associations (zymodemes) were recorded for the 70 isolates studied. While only one multilocus combination was found in mice and rabbits, three different multilocus associations were recorded in rats. Population genetic tests and phylogenetic analysis strongly suggest that P. carinii genotypes are host-specific, in agreement with molecular study results, and that no genetic exchange occurs between genotypes from different host species. This hypothesis could be verified only by the evolutionary genetic approach, which relies here on multilocus analysis.

TI Phylogeography and host association in a pollinating seed parasite Greya
   politella (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae)
AB Inferring the historical context of ecological diversification is an important step in understanding the way that population-level processes result in a diversity of species and interactions in communities. We performed a phylogeographic analysis of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes from the pollinating seed parasite Greya politella (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) in order to determine the degree to which populations were structured according to geographical location and host-plant association. Ninety-eight individuals were sampled from 29 locations ranging from southern California to western Idaho. Restriction-site variation in 87 individuals (27 populations) was screened by digestion with 11 endonucleases, followed by Southern blotting; 38 restriction-site positions were mapped by double digests. Haplotypes were further defined by generating fragments 251 bases in length via PCR, screening them for sequence variation using denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE), and sequencing the resulting variants. Parsimony analysis of the resulting 12 restriction-site and 15 sequence haplotypes indicated strong geographical structuring of populations: (i) most populations were monomorphic for haplotype; (ii) haplotypes from California and the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington and Idaho) formed robust monophyletic groups. Population structure was significant both within and between the two regions, as reflected by N-ST. Patterns of host-plant association and haplotype phylogeny suggest that populations have recently undergone host-plant shifts in many different parts of the species range, although the direction and number of host shifts cannot be determined at the present level of sampling resolution.

TI Effect of changing partnership formation rates on the spread of sexually
   transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus
AB Core population groups play an important role in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Subjects in a core group may change their behavior over time and ''migrate'' to the noncore. The authors examined the effects of such migration on the prevalence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using a mathematical model. The size of the core and the migration rate from the core to the noncore were estimated from population-based sexual survey data on 8,445 Norwegians collected in 1987 and 1992. Sixty-four percent of the sample was considered without risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. The core group made up 2.5% of the remaining sample. The migration rate from the core was estimated at 12% per year. The three types of infections analyzed exemplify three different patterns of the effect of migration on infection prevalence in the core/noncore groups: gonorrhea = no effect/no effect, chlamydia = no effect/increase, and HIV = decrease/increase. Migration affects the basic reproductive ratio of diseases with a long infectious period more than that of diseases with a short infectious period, For HIV, this means that the later stages of infection contribute less to the basic reproductive ratio in the presence of migration, The results are qualitative and show that detailed knowledge about mixing, migration, transmission rates, and duration of infectiousness is necessary to make accurate predictions.

TI Dexamethasone inhibits virus production and the secretory IgA response
   in oesophageal-pharyngeal fluid in cattle persistently infected with
   foot-and-mouth disease virus
AB Cattle persistently infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus were treated with dexamethasone to suppress the immune system in an attempt to influence the level of virus recovery from oesophageal-pharyngeal (probang) samples. Twelve carrier cattle were assigned to one of three groups: control; 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone; and 0.5 mg/kg dexamethasone. Groups 2 and 3 were injected intramuscularly three times weekly for 3 weeks with dexamethasone between days 33 and 56 post-infection with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Cattle in both groups developed a leucocytosis, neutrophilia and lymphopenia. The secretory IgA response to FMDV infection was inhibited following, but not during, dexamethasone treatment between days 70 and 98 post-infection (P < 0.05). FMDV recovery from probang samples was reduced between days 40 and 64 post-infection (P < 0.05) during treatment with either 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg dexamethasone. Following cessation of dosing with dexamethasone virus recovery returned to control levels. These observations suggest dexamethasone inhibits shedding of FMDV in a reversible manner which may be related to its immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory or physiological actions.

TI Costs and benefits of mosquito refractoriness to malaria parasites:
   Implications for genetic variability of mosquitoes and genetic control
   of malaria
AB The problem of fitness costs associated with host resistance to parasitism is related to the evolution of parasite virulence, population genetic diversity and the dynamics of host-parasite relationships, and proposed strategies for disease control through the genetic manipulation of mosquito vectors. Two Aedes aegypti populations, refractory and susceptible to Plasmodium gallinaceum, were previously selected from the Moyo-In-Dry strain (MOYO) through inbreeding (F = 0.5). Reproductive success and survivorship of the two populations were compared, and the influence of the parasite on mosquito fitness also was evaluated. Fitness components studied include fecundity, adult survivorship and egg-to-adult developmental time, blood-meal size, and adult body size. The refractory population has a significantly shorter egg-to-adult developmental time and a smaller body size, takes a smaller blood meal, and subsequently lays fewer eggs than the susceptible population. The mean longevity of the refractory population is significantly shorter than the susceptible population. Exposure to the parasite exhibited little effect on the survivorship and fecundity of either population. Several factors may contribute to the lower fitness of the refractory population, including founder effect, inbreeding depression, the effect of other uncharacterized genes linked to genes conferring refractoriness, and pleiotropic effects associated with these genes. The results are discussed in relation to the genetic diversity of natural mosquito populations and their implications for the genetic control of malaria.

   type 1 disease in women
AB The fundamental clinical, viral, and immunologic features of early-stage human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease were examined in a seroprevalent cohort of 28 men and 14 women assessed longitudinally at three equally dispersed time points over a mean of 43 months. There were no gender differences in the relative risk of developing AIDS-defining end points or death, The median serum RNA levels assessed at the three study time points were 3.3-, 4.9-, and 1.5-fold lower, respectively, in women than in men. This suggests that while serum virus load may be as powerful a correlate of disease status in women as it is in men, the absolute values of the virus levels may be different in the 2 populations, These observations may have implications for the interpretation of levels of virus burden in women for the assessment of disease progression, transmission, and treatment.

TI Epidemic Venezuelan equine encephalitis in La Guajira, Colombia, 1995
AB In 1995, the first Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) outbreak in Colombia in 22 years caused an estimated 75,000 human cases, 3000 with neurologic complications and 300 fatal, in La Guajira State. Of the state's estimated 50,000 equines, 8% may have died. An epizootic IC virus, probably introduced from Venezuela, was rapidly amplified among unvaccinated equines. Record high rainfall, producing high densities of vector Aedes taeniorhynchus, led to extensive epidemic transmission (30% attack rate) in the four affected municipalities. Native Wayuu Indians, constituting 24% of the state's population, were at increased risk of infection (risk ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-5.3). Epidemiologic studies found no evidence of human-to-human transmission. A higher-than-expected number of abortions during the outbreak confirmed a previously suspected abortifacient role of VEE infection. Pesticide applications and a mass equine vaccination program contributed to preventing the outbreak's spread south of La Guajira.

TI Adaptive changes in Plasmodium transmission strategies following
   chloroquine chemotherapy
AB Both theory and data suggest that malaria parasites divert resources from within-host replication to the production of transmission stages (gametocytes) when conditions deteriorate. Increased investment into transmission stages should therefore follow subcurative treatment with antimalarial drugs, but relevant clinical studies necessarily lack adequate control groups. We therefore carried out controlled experiments to test this hypothesis, using a rodent malaria (Plasmodium chabaudi) model. Infections treated with a subcurative dose of the antimalarial chloroquine showed an earlier peak and a greater rate of gametocyte production relative to untreated controls. These alterations led to correlated changes in infectivity to mosquitoes, with the consequence that chloroquine treatment had no effect oil the proportion of mosquitoes infected. Treatment of human malaria commonly does not result in complete parasite clearance. If surviving parasites produce compensatory increases in their rate of similar to those reported here, such treatment may have minimal effect on decreasing, and may actually increase, transmission. Importantly, if increased investment in transmission is a generalized stress response, the effect might be observed following a variety of antimalarial treatments, including other drugs and potential vaccines. Similar parasite life history counter-adaptations to intervention strategies are likely to occur in many disease-causing organisms.

TI Polymorphism in sexual versus non-sexual disease transmission
AB Pathogens causing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) often consist of related strains that cause nonsexually transmitted, or 'ordinary infectious', diseases (OIDs). We use differential equation models of single populations to derive conditions under which a genetic variant with one (e.g. sexual) transmission mode can invade and successfully displace a genetic variant with a different (e.g. non-sexual) transmission mode. Invasion by an STD is easier if the equilibrium population size in the presence of an OID is smaller; conversely an OID can invade more easily if the equilibrium size of the population with the STD is larger. Invasion of an STD does not depend on the degree of sterility caused by the infection, but does depend on the added mortality caused by a resident OID. In contrast, the ability of an OID to invade a population at equilibrium with an STD decreases as the degree of sterility caused by the STD increases. When equilibrium population sizes for a population infected with an STD are above the point at which non-sexual contacts exceed sexual contacts (the sexual-social crossover point) and when equilibrium population sizes for an OID are below this point, there can be a stable genetic polymorphism for transmission mode. This is most likely when the STD is mildly sterilizing, and the OID causes low or intermediate levels of added mortality. Because we assume the strains are competitively equivalent and there are no heterogeneities associated with the transmission process, the polymorphism is maintained by density-dependent selection brought about by pathogen effects on population size.

TI Prevalence of human retroviral infection in Quillabamba and Cuzco, Peru:
   A new endemic area for human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1
AB An epidemiologic study was conducted to determine the prevalence of retroviral infections among people of Quechua origin in Cuzco and Quillabamba, Peru. The study volunteers included individuals at low and at high risk for retroviral infections. Each volunteer was interviewed to obtain clinical and epidemiologic data, and to identify risk behaviors for infection. The serum was tested for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T cell lymphotropic virus types 1/2 (HTLV-1/2) by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent and Western blot assays. Among a total of 370 volunteers enrolled in the study, 276 were women and 94 were men whose ages ranged between 15 and 49 years. Infection with HTLV-1 was demonstrated in 5.1% (19 of 370), and one of these, a homosexual, was also positive for HIV-1; none had HTLV-2. Overall, the rate of HTLV-1 infection was 5.3% (5 of 94) for males and 5% (14 of 276) for females. Among the low risk group of 211 healthy pregnant women, five (2.3%) were positive for HTLV-1. The rate of HTLV-1 infection in this group was significantly correlated with a history of dental surgery, as well as other surgical procedures, and a history of jaundice. Among the volunteers who practiced risk behavior(s) for retroviral infections, the positive rates for HTLV-1 were 13.7% (7 of 51) for female sex workers, 6.2% (3 of 48) for homosexuals and/or bisexuals, 8.5% (4 of 47) for patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and 0.0% (0 of 13) for promiscuous heterosexual males. In female sex workers, HTLV-1 infection was found to be significantly associated with age, a history of STDs or genital ulcers, sexual intercourse during menses, and vaginal douching (P < 0.05). A low prevalence of HIV-1 infection indicates that the virus has not yet spread significantly in these areas.

TI Behavior of Wolbachia endosymbionts from Drosophila simulans in
   Drosophila serrata, a novel host
AB Many species harbor the incompatibility-inducing microbe Wolbachia, a maternally inherited endoparasite that causes reduced egg hatch in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Infected females are immune to this effect, which gives them a relative fitness advantage that results in the spread of the infection. The strength of incompatibility, fitness deficits associated with the infection, and transmission rate from mother to offspring largely determine the rate and extent of spread of Wolbachia in a population. We transferred Wolbachia from Drosophila simulans to Drosophila serrata, a novel host, and compared parameter estimates with those from three naturally occurring Drosophila-Wolbachia associations believed to be of different ages. Transfected D. serrata showed strong incompatibility, low transmission efficiency, and an associated fitness deficit, and they would probably be unable to spread in nature. The comparisons generally supported the predicted evolution of a host-Wolbachia association. The parameters peculiar to any given host-Wolbachia association may determine whether the microbial strain can spread in that host.

TI How parasites can promote the expression of social behaviour in their
   hosts
AB Recent theory on the role of parasites in the evolution of social behaviour has emphasized the costs of social behaviour to hosts. However, parasites whose primary effect on host fitness is to reduce fecundity can favour the evolutionary origin or maintenance of social behaviour, including eusociality, under certain conditions. If the parasites are not readily transmitted among members of social groups, then other group members will not be selected to reject infected individuals as social partners, nor will adaptive suicide or avoidance of grouping be selectively favoured for infected individuals. Rather, total or partial parasitic castration may promote the expression of helping behaviour by infected individuals. Some parasites may therefore act to increase variance in direct reproductive value within populations or societies, and to promote reproductive division of labour. The necessary conditions of reduced host fecundity and low within-group transmission are met in some insect-parasite systems, and could occur in other host-parasite systems as well.

TI Chronicity in Strongyloides stercoralis infections: Dichotomy of the
   protective immune response to infective and autoinfective larvae in a
   mouse model
AB Strongyloidiasis is an intestinal disease that can last for decades due to the occurrence of autoinfective larvae (L3a) in an infected person, which contribute to the maintenance of the population of adult worms in the intestine. The goal of the present study was to determine if L3a are susceptible to the protective immunity that targets the infective stage of the worm, the third-stage larvae (L3). Mice immunized and challenged with Strongyloides stercoralis L3 kill more than 90% of challenge larvae contained within diffusion chambers. The L3 do not remain antigenically static in mice, however, but undergo some degree of antigenic change before they are killed, becoming host-activated larvae (L3+). The L3/L3+ are killed in this model system by the combined effects of both parasite-specific IgM and eosinophils. Mice immunized with L3 were able to hill L3/L3+, but did not kill L3a, in challenge infections. Eosinophils were, however, present in diffusion chambers containing L3a, and IgM bound to the surface of L3a. We hypothesized that differential IgM recognition of soluble L3a, L3, and L3+ antigens is the reason why the immune response generated against L3 could not kill L3a. Many common antigens on L3, L3+, and L3a were recognized by serum from mice immunized with L3, as determined by immunoblotting. However, several unique L3, L3+, and L3a antigens were also recognized by immune serum, thus indicating that antigen recognition with IgM antibodies is different between the L3, L3+, and L3a stages. This difference in antigen recognition could explain why L3a are able to evade the immune response that targets L3/L3+ in chronically infected hosts.

AB Sixty-six Javanese transmigrants moving from Java, an area of very low malaria transmission, to Irian Jaya, an area of high malaria transmission, were monitored to evaluate the effects of exposure to malaria transmission and age on resistance to infection and the induction of humoral immunity. The risk of acquiring Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia was not statistically greater in children (5-15 years of age) than in adults (> 15 years of age) during the first 14 months of exposure. However, during the cross-sectional survey at 14 months of exposure, children did have significantly higher P. falciparum asexual blood-stage parasite densities. Serum antibody titers to R32LR, a peptide containing sequences from the P. falciparum circumsporozoite repeat region, and MSP19, a proteolytic fragment of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) from P. falciparum, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Exposure for both six and 14 months produced statistically significant increased antibody titers to both R32LR and MSP-1; no age-dependent difference in antibody titers was observed. In this population, exposure to malaria transmission induced antibodies to antigens associated with immunity to malaria. In addition, we noted an age-dependent difference in the parasitemia density of P. falciparum.

AB Puumala virus, the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE), occurs endemically in Europe and is spread mainly by the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). In the vicinity of each of four households afflicted with NE, we studied rodents with regard to population density and prevalence of Puumala virus-specific antibodies. For each case area, a control area was randomly selected 10 km away, without regard to the presence of human settlement. During 6,000 trap nights, 328 rodents were caught, of which 299 were C. glareolus. The mean rodent densities of case and control areas were 6.6 and 3.7 animals per 100 trap nights (P<0.001). The prevalence of serum antibodies was 15.9% in case areas compared with 5.6% in control areas (P<0.05). In three of the case areas, where NE had occurred 3-10 weeks before trapping, the rodent density and seroprevalence were much higher than in the fourth area, where NE occurred 38 weeks before trapping. In conclusion, C. glareolus seropositive for Puumala virus occurred more frequently near households afflicted with NE than in control areas 10 km away.

TI An epidemiological model incorporating vector population dynamics
   applied to African cassava mosaic virus disease
AB 1. An epidemiological model of African cassava mosaic virus disease (ACMD) was developed in which the dynamics within a locality, of healthy and infected cassava, and of infective and non-infective whitefly vectors, were specified.
   2. Cassava is propagated routinely from stem cuttings. If the exclusive use of virus-free cuttings was assumed then either a high rate of virus transmission by the vector or a large population of vectors could lead to persistent cycles in disease incidence. Such cycling could seriously impair cassava production.
   3. When frequency-dependent use elf infected cuttings was admitted, however, persistent cycles of infection were no longer possible. Instead, three states could occur: disease eliminated (E), both healthy and diseased cassava persisted (P), or infection became total (T). The outcome depended on the particular parameter values, but some parameter combinations gave state P or T, depending on the initial conditions. In some instances, low initial incidence of ACMD posed a greater risk of progressing to state T than did higher levels of infection.
   4. In general, disease incidence exhibited a discontinuous, threshold response to changes in the proportion of infected cuttings used. An increase in their use could appear to have little impact on incidence, although the system was moving closer to a point of sudden increase in infection.
   5. Simulation of the removal (roguing) of diseased plants had little influence on disease incidence, but had an important and largely cryptic effect by helping to move the system away from the threshold of collapse of the healthy cassava population. Intensification of cassava production (represented in the model as an increase in the maximum possible abundance of cassava) had the opposite effect, moving the system closer to this threshold.
   6. Assuming a degree of disease 'reversion', whereby a proportion of the cuttings derived from infected plants are uninfected, had a stabilizing influence on the model, making even damped cycles of disease very unlikely. Total infection did not now occur except at very low reversion rates. The response of disease incidence to the increased use of infected cuttings was no longer discontinuous but remained nonlinear and there was a region of rapid change corresponding to the threshold seen in the absence of reversion.

TI Dynamics of two feline retroviruses (FIV and FeLV) within one population
   of cats
AB We present a deterministic model of the dynamics of two microparasites simultaneously infecting a single host population. Both microparasites are feline retroviruses: namely Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukaemia Virus (FeLV). The host is the domestic cat Felis catus. The model has been tested with data generated by a long-term study of several natural cat populations. Stability analysis and simulations show that, once introduced in a population, FIV spreads and is maintained, while FeLV can either disappear or persist. Moreover, introduction of both viruses into the population induces an equilibrium state for individuals of each different pathological class. The viruses never induce the extinction of the population. Furthermore, whatever the outcome for the host population (persistence of FIV only, or of both viruses), the global population size at the equilibrium state is only slightly lower than it would have been in the absence of the infections (i.e. at the carrying capacity), indicating a low impact of the viruses on the population. Finally, the impact of the diseases examined simultaneously is higher than the sum of the impact of the two diseases examined separately. This seems to be due to a higher mortality rate when both viruses infect a single individual.

TI Interactions between frequency-dependent and vertical transmission in
   host-parasite systems
AB We investigate host-pathogen dynamics and conditions for coexistence in two models incorporating frequency-dependent horizontal transmission in conjunction with vertical transmission. The first model combines frequency-dependent and uniparental vertical transmission, while the second addresses parasites transmitted vertically via both parents. For the first model, we ask how the addition of vertical transmission changes the coexistence criteria for parasites transmitted by a frequency-dependent horizontal route, and show that vertical transmission significantly broadens the conditions for parasite invasion. Host-parasite coexistence is further affected by the form of density-dependent host regulation. Numerical analyses demonstrate that within a host population, a parasite strain with horizontal frequency-dependent transmission can be driven to extinction by a parasite strain that is additionally transmitted vertically for a wide range of parameters. Although models of asexual host population? predict that vertical transmission alone cannot maintain a parasite over time, analysis of our second model shows that vertical transmission via both male and female parents can maintain a parasite at a stable equilibrium. These results correspond with the frequent co-occurrence of vertical with sexual transmission in nature and suggest that these transmission modes call lead to host-pathogen coexistence for a wide range of systems involving hosts with high reproductive rates.

TI Potential versus actual contribution of vertical transmission to
   pathogen fitness
AB Theory predicts that virulent parasites cannot be maintained at high prevalence if they are only vertically transmitted. However, parasites with high rates of vertical transmission that cause severe reduction in host fitness have been reported. Atkinsonella hypoxylon is a fungal pathogen capable of both vertical and horizontal transmission that drastically reduces its host's fitness. In contrast with theoretical predictions, field and laboratory observations suggested that the primary mechanism of transmission was vertical. Using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers, we investigated the effective contribution of vertical and horizontal transmission to the genetic structure of three natural populations of A. hypoxylon. We found high genotypic diversity and low linkage disequilibrium, indicating that most established genotypes are derived from horizontally transmitted, sexual spores. The low contribution of vertical transmission to the parasite's fitness despite its high potential might be due to lower establishment of cleistogamous seeds (through which vertical transmission occurs) or lower vigour of vertically transmitted fungal genotypes. Low establishment of vertically infected hosts might explain the persistence of virulent parasites with high apparent vertical transmission. Our results suggest that caution must be taken when using the potential for vertical transmission to make predictions about the evolution of parasite virulence.

TI Mixed-genotype infections of malaria parasites: Within-host dynamics and
   transmission success of competing clones
AB Mixed-genotype infections of microparasites are common, but almost nothing is known about how competitive interactions within hosts affect the subsequent transmission success of individual genotypes. We investigated changes in the composition of mixed-genotype infections of the rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi clones CR and ER by monoclonal antibody analysis of the asexual infection in mice, and by PCR amplification of clone-specific alleles in oocysts sampled from mosquitoes which had fed on these mice. Mixed-clone infections were initiated with a 9:1 ratio of the two clones, with ER as the minority in the first experiment and CR as the minority in the second experiment.
   When beginning as the majority, clones achieved parasite densities in mice comparable to those achieved in control (single-clone) infections. When they began as the minority, clones were suppressed to less than 10 % of control parasitaemias during the early part of the infections. However, in mosquitoes, the frequency of the initially rare clone was substantially greater than it was in mice at the start of the infection or four days prior to the feed. In both experiments, the minority clone in the inocula produced as many, or more, oocysts than it did as a single-clone infection. These experiments show that asexual dominance during most of the infection is poorly correlated to transmission probability, and therefore that the assumption that within-host population size correlates to transmission probability may not be warranted. They also raise the fundamental question of why transmission rates of individual genotypes are often higher from mixed than single-clone infections.

TI Epidemic and sporadic hepatitis E virus transmission in West Kalimantan
   (Borneo), Indonesia
AB A cross-sectional survey was conducted in West Kalimantan (Borneo), Indonesia to geographically profile hepatitis E virus (HEV) prevalence in the riverine areas recognized as the foci of epidemic HEV transmission in 1987. Additionally, a contiguous, although distinct, population with no identifiable historical exposure to epidemic HEV was surveyed downstream for comparative purposes. Eight hundred eighty-five sera were assayed by enzyme immunoabsorbent assay for anti-HEV IgG and anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgG markers. A very high percent (90%) of both the outbreak and comparison populations was anti-HAV IgG positive by the age of nine years. In contrast, the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG in the outbreak area (50%) was significantly higher than in the comparison area (23%) (P < 0.0001). In both the outbreak and comparison areas, anti-HEV IgG prevalence increased with age (< 0.0001), except for the group greater than or equal to 50 years of age. The prevalence (53%) of antibody to HEV in the population greater than or equal to seven years of age from the outbreak area (alive during the actual 1987 outbreak) was significantly (P < 0.0001) greater than among the children < seven years of age (born after the outbreak) (15%). However, anti-HEV IgG prevalence among the population from the comparison area did not differ significantly between the greater than or equal to seven- (23%) and < seven- (20%) year-old age groups. The percentage of anti-HEV IgG-positive individuals among males (47%) from the outbreak area was lower (P < 0.05) compared with females (55%). While overall usage of river water for drinking purposes was not universal, dependence on river water as a primary source was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in households from the outbreak area (60%) compared with the comparison area (30%). This study indicates persistence of an anti-HEV IgG response in a large percentage of the population seven years after an epidemic of HEV infections. Also, the relatively high prevalence (15%) of anti-HEV in children , seven years of age from the outbreak area reflects continuing, sporadic infections.

TI Impact of a pollinator-transmitted disease on reproduction in healthy
   Silene acaulis
AB Pathogens affect the evolution of their hosts only to the extent that the host's ability to reproduce is altered. Microbotryum violaceum is a pollinator-transmitted fungal pathogen that causes infected individuals to produce sterile flowers with anthers full of fungal spores. In North American Rocky Mountain populations of Silene acaulis, a host to M. violaceum, reproduction in infected individuals is severely affected, but disease spread is slow (<1% new infections over a 4-yr period). This study addresses whether diseased plants can affect reproduction in healthy individuals even if the healthy plant does not become diseased. I studied Silene acaulis in the field to examine traits of diseased and healthy plants, pollen deposition, spore deposition, and seed production in healthy plants. Diseased plants were significantly larger than healthy plants, and in contrast to other studies of anther smut with different hosts, infected individuals did not produce more flowers than healthy individuals. Timing of flowering was similar for healthy and diseased plants, but peak deposition of pollen and fungal spores differed at some sites. Therefore, plants could potentially maximize their fitness by flowering at times of peak deposition of pollen while avoiding exposure to peak deposition of fungal spores. Finally, healthy flowers receiving additions of pollen and moderate to high loads of fungal spores produced significantly less seed compared to flowers receiving only pollen. Although the risk of becoming diseased may be low in this population, healthy individuals can be affected by anther smut because the majority of flowers receive fungal spores, which may be interfering with pollen grains and reducing seed production.

TI Immediate and delayed effects of a viral pathogen and density on tent
   caterpillar performance
AB In small-scale field and related laboratory experiments, I examined the immediate and delayed effects of nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) introduction and density on the performance of Malacosoma californicum pluviale. In a factorial experiment, larvae at high density showed increased feeding and development rates and decreased reproductive potential. The introduction of NPV significantly increased per capita mortality of the host, particularly at high density, and generally reduced host reproductive potential. Adults from this experiment were mated and their offspring reared in the laboratory. Pupal mass of female offspring was influenced by treatments in the parental generation, whereas egg viability, larval development time and mortality, and pupal mass of male offspring were not. M. c. pluviale introduced to host trees the year following the factorial experiment showed no effects of previous caterpillar density on mortality or reproductive potential, as would be predicted by host-plant induction theory. An interactive effect of previous virus introduction and density on mortality was observed due to the persistence of NPV in the environment. Results are discussed in light of population dynamics and observed changes in fecundity in tent caterpillar populations.

TI Emerging and reemerging helminthiases and the public health of China
AB Despite great strides in their control throughout the People's Republic of China, helminth infections remain an important public health problem. The Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, under the guidance of the Chinese Ministry of Health, completed a nationwide survey of more than 1 million people that showed the high prevalence and intensity of intestinal nematode infections; prevalence can sometimes exceed 50% in the Yangtze River valley provinces. Schistosoma japonicum is also a major cause of illness in this region. Attempts to control Chinese helminthic diseases with conventional anthelminthic drugs have been partially thwarted by high posttreatment rates of reinfection. Recently, several new human trematode pathogens have been identified. Novel approaches to chemoprophylaxis and vaccination may alleviate the public health problem caused by Chinese helminths. However, recombinant helminth vaccine development will depend on first cataloguing the extensive genetic diversity of Chinese helminths and candidate vaccine antigens. Evidence from biogeography, genetics, and systematics suggests that the genetic diversification of Chinese helminths and their vectors is an ongoing evolutionary process that began 12 million years ago near the convergence of major Asian river systems. Construction of the Three Gorges Super Dam on the Yangtze River may promote the emergence and reemergence of new helminths and their snail vectors.

TI Aedes albopictus in the United States: Ten-year presence and public
   health implications
AB Since its discovery in Houston, Texas, in 1987, the Asian ''tiger mosquito'' Aedes albopictus has spread to 678 counties in 25 states. This species, which readily colonizes container habitats in the peridomestic environment, was probably introduced into the continental United States in shipments of scrap tires from northern Asia. The early pattern of dispersal followed the interstate highway system, which suggests further dispersal by human activities. The Public Health Service Act of 1988 requires shipments of used tires from countries with Ae. albopictus to be treated to prevent further importations. Given the extensive spread of the mosquito in the United States, it is questionable whether such a requirement is still justified. Ae. albopictus, a major biting pest throughout much of its range, is a competent laboratory vector of at least 22 arboviruses, including many viruses of public health importance. Cache Valley and eastern equine encephalomyelitis viruses are the only human pathogens isolated from U.S. populations of Ae. albopictus. There is no evidence that this mosquito is the vector of human disease in the United States.

TI Consequences of Wolbachia transmission process on the infection dynamics
AB In some species displaying Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility, the intensity of incompatibility depends on the density of symbionts in both parents. Although modalities of the transmission process are poorly known, it appears that the density of Wolbachia within the offspring of a female is variable and is correlated with that of the mother. Assuming that the infection level of an host is a continuous trait, we examine some theoretical consequences of the Wolbachia transmission process on the evolution of the infection level within a population. The hypotheses of this model concern two main points: the transmission of Wolbachia is affected by stochastic processes and a deterministic bias, and the bacterial load of the parents of a cross affects their compatibility relationships. It is shown that the variance of the number of bacteria transmitted induced by the stochastic processes tends to counteract the effect of bacterial curing on the dynamics of infection. A general consequence of the model is that the extinction of Wolbachia is possible even if there is strong incompatibility and no selective disadvantage for the host to bear the bacteria. The model indicates that the evolution of bacterial mutants does not depend on the level of incompatibility they induce, but that mutants with higher transmission variance can be selected for. Moreover, the mean infection level of the host population increases in the presence of such bacteria.

TI Specificity in the symbiotic association of Lotus corniculatus and
   Rhizobium loti from natural populations
AB To test whether Rhizobium loti are co-adapted to nodulate local plant genotypes, we competed X. loti-strains in a common environment with clonally propagated Lotus corniculatus. Both the plants and bacterial strains were originally collected from natural populations in three localities and the X. loti strains used were distinguishable by enzyme electrophoretic markers and differed in geographical origin relative to host plant origin. The proportions of nodules occupied by symbiont strains varied widely and depended on both host plant and symbiont genotype. Nonrandom nodulation patterns resulted primarily from preferential nodulation of host genotypes by the symbiont strain that had been associated with the host in the natural environment. Symbionts nodulating their original hosts were preferentially found in nodules on adventitious tap roots as opposed to the younger, lateral roots (for one host-symbiont pair) or in large nodules, independent of location on the root system (for a second host-symbiont pair). The proportion of nodules occupied by a symbiont on novel host genotypes varied, ranging from nearly random expectation to a significant reduction in the proportion of nodules occupied. The analysis of the bacteria recovered from 994 nodules by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis revealed that 952 (95.8%) nodules were occupied by one of the four inoculant strains and 11 (1.1%) were co-occupied by two inoculant strains. A total of 31 (3.1%) nodules were occupied by strains that did not match the electrophoretic profiles of the original inoculant strains. Based on the comparison of multilocus profiles for 23 enzyme loci, we concluded that these bacteria were foreign strains and not recombinants of the original inoculant strains. Our findings indicate a strong host genotype by strain interaction underlying the outcome of rhizobial competition for nodulation sites and suggest there are distinct mechanisms leading to differential recognition of compatible host and symbiont genotypes.

AB The authors investigated quarterly trends in survival after the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia for 19,607 patients in California in the decade from January 1, 1983, through December 31, 1992. Subjects included all cases for whom P. carinii pneumonia was the initial (and only) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining diagnosis as reported to the California human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS surveiliance registry. There was a period of rapidly improving survival from approximately June 1986 until April 1988, coincident with the widespread introduction of antiretroviral therapy (zidovudine) and the institution of P. carinii pneumonia prophylaxis (with cotrimoxazole and pentamidine). There was no evidence, however, of meaningful improvements in survival for these patients after that period. The association of several covariates (risk transmission group, gender, race/ethnicity, certainty of P. carinii pneumonia diagnosis, age, region of residence, availability of CD4 count, and level of CD4 count) were also studied both by proportional hazards regression and by recursive partitioning (i.e., tree-based) survival analysis. The availability of a CD4 count (regardless of its level) was the single factor most strongly associated with survival (median survival 36 months among those with and 14 months among those without reported CD4 counts, p < 0.05). Data from this large, population-based surveillance registry of AIDS in California suggest that, despite earlier improvements in survival after the diagnosis of P. carinii pneumonia, the long-term survival of these patients remains poor (39% alive 2 years after diagnosis) and that no improvement in survival has occurred since 1988.

TI Scaling and spatial dynamics in plant-pathogen systems: From individuals
   to populations
AB Components of transmission for primary infection from soil-borne inoculum and secondary (plant to plant) infection are estimated from experiments involving single plants. The results from these individual-based experiments are used in a probabilistic spatial contact process (cellular automaton) to predict the progress of an epidemic. The model accounts for spatial correlations between infected and susceptible plants due to inhomogeneous mixing caused by restricted movement of the pathogen in soil. It also integrates nonlinearities in infection, including small stochastic differences in primary infection that become amplified by secondary infection. The model predicts both the mean and the variance of the infection dynamics of R. solani when compared with replicated epidemics in populations of plants grown in microcosms. The broader consequences of the combination of experimental and modelling approaches for scaling-up from individual to population behaviour are discussed.

TI Optimal killing for obligate killers: The evolution of life histories
   and virulence of semelparous parasites
AB Many viral, bacterial and protozoan parasites of invertebrates first propagate inside their host without releasing any transmission stages and then kill their host to release all transmission stages at once. Life history and the evolution of virulence of these obligately killing parasites are modelled, assuming that within-host growth is density dependent. We find that the parasite should kill the host when its per capita growth rate falls to the level of the host mortality rate. The parasite should kill its host lat er when the carrying capacity, K, is higher, but should kill it earlier when the parasite-independent host mortality increases or when the parasite has a higher birth rate. When K(t), for parasite growth, is not constant over the duration of an infection, but increases with time, the parasite should kill the host around the stage when the growth rate of the carrying capacity decelerates strongly. In case that K(t) relates to host body size, this deceleration in growth is around host maturation.

TI Impact of dengue virus infection on feeding behavior of Aedes aegypti
AB In addition to heavily infecting the salivary glands of Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes, dengue viruses produce a significant infection of the nervous system, involving the brain, Johnston's organ, compound eye, and thoracic and abdominal ganglion. To determine if dengue infection affects feeding behavior of Ae. aegypti we measured feeding times, counted the number of feeding delays or interruptions, and by in situ immunocytochemistry techniques determined the spatial and temporal distribution of dengue infections in females parenterally infected with dengue 3 virus. The mean of the total time required for feeding by infected mosquitoes was significantly longer than the time required by uninfected mosquitoes. Similarly, the mean of the time spent probing was significantly longer in infected mosquitoes than in uninfected mosquitoes when day after inoculation was considered. Significant increases in the length of feeding activity in infected mosquitoes corresponded to virus infection in organs that are known to control or influence activities associated with blood feeding. Sequential infections of the salivary glands (five days postinoculation [PI]), brain and compound eye (eight days PI), and Johnston's organ and midgut and abdominal ganglion (11 days PI) of most mosquitoes were observed. The increased time required by infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to acquire a blood meal may contribute to the efficiency of Ae. aegypti as a vector of dengue virus. Longer feeding periods are more likely to be interrupted by the host, which increases the chance that an infected mosquito will probe or feed on additional hosts.

AB Following per oral infection of Aedes aegypti larvae with Aedes albopictus parvovirus (AaPV), infected males and females adults were tested for their ability to transmit the virus venereally and vertically, respectively. Both types of transmission were observed. A low percentage (2.2%) of AaPV-free females were found contaminated by the virus after mating with AaPV-infected males. Although no significant difference was observed in the fecundity of orally infected and virus-free females, 17.1% of infected ones died before egg laying, whereas no mortality occurred during the same period in virus-free females. There was a clear relationship between the virus titer in the orally infected females and both mortality and infection in their offspring. The virus titer averaged 10(6,2) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID(50)s) in F-1 females and 10(3,3) TCID50 in F-1 females. Nevertheless, AaPV did not persist in an experimentally infected population of mosquitoes beyond the second generation.

   State, Brazil, 1993-1994: Epidemiologic and entomologic findings
AB Yellow fever virus transmission was very active in Maranhao State in Brazil in 1993 and 1994. An investigation was carried out to evaluate the magnitude of the epidemic. In 1993, a total of 932 people was examined for yellow fever from Maranhao: 70 were positive serologically, histopathologically, and/or by virus isolation, and another four cases were diagnosed clinically and epidemiologically. In Mirador (17,565 inhabitants), the incidence was 3.5 per 1,000 people (case fatality rate [number of deaths/number of cases diagnosed] = 16.4%), while in a rural yellow fever risk area (14,659 inhabitants), the incidence was 4.2 and the case-fatality rate was 16.1% (10 of 62). A total of 45.2% (28 of 62) asymptomatic infections were registered. In 1994, 49 serum samples were obtained and 16 cases were confirmed (two by virus isolation, two by seroconversion, and 12 by serology). No fatal cases were reported. In 1993, 936 potential yellow fever vectors were captured in Mirador and a single strain was isolated from a pool of Haemagogus janthinomys (infection rate = 0.16%). In 1994, 16 strains were isolated from 1,318 Hg. janthinomys (infection rate = 1.34%) and one Sabethes chloropterus (infection rate = 1.67%). Our results suggest that this was the most extensive outbreak of yellow fever in the last 20 years in Brazil. It is also clear that the lack of vaccination was the principal reason for the epidemic, which occurred between April and June, during the rainy season, a period in which the mosquito population in the forest increases.

   Brazil
AB Serologic screening for human T cell lymphotropic virus types 1/2 (HTLV-1/2) infection in blood donors has been recently introduced in Brazil. Analysis of 351,639 blood donations in Sao Paulo from January 1992 to October 1993 identified 1,063 positive (0.30%) and 2,238 indeterminate (0.63%) samples based on serologic confirmation using a 21e Western blot. A detailed analysis (serologic, molecular, and virologic), based on a laboratory diagnostic algorithm for characterization of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections was undertaken in 50 seropositive or seroindeterminate blood donors. Modified serologic assays (2.3 Western blot that incorporate type-specific recombinant peptides) performed in 29 HTLV-1/2 positive and 21 HTLV-1/2 indeterminate donors with the 21e Western blot identified 25 as infected with HTLV-1, four with HTLV-2, five with untypable HTLV-1/2, 15 as HTLV-1/2 indeterminate, and one as seronegative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using DNA amplification of proviral pol and tax sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections in all 2.3 Western blot seropositive donors; of the five serologically untypable donors, three were confirmed to be HTLV-1 positive, one HTLV-2 positive, and one negative by PCR. All of the seroindeterminate donors were also negative by PCR. Furthermore, HTLV-1 could be isolated in cocultures from 10 of 18 infected donors. Cell lines developed from two HTLV-l-infected donors were of T cell phenotype (CD2(+), CD3(+)), exhibiting surface markers of activated CD4 cells (CD4(+) CD25(+) HLA-DR+). Thus, we provide evidence for the high seroprevalence of HTLV infection in blood donor population in Sao Paulo, Brazil compared with North American donors and propose a comprehensive serologic and genotypic diagnostic algorithm for HTLV-infected donors that has strong implications for counseling of these individuals.

TI Water-borne hepatitis E virus epidemic in Islamabad, Pakistan: A common
   source outbreak traced to the malfunction of a modern water treatment
   plant
AB During December 1993 and in the first three months of 1994, an explosive water-borne epidemic of hepatitis E virus (HEV) occurred in two sectors of Islamabad, Pakistan. In a survey of a population of 36,705 individuals, a total of 3,827 cases of acute icteric hepatitis were recorded with an overall attack rate (AR) of 10.4%. The etiologic role of HEV in the epidemic was proven by demonstrating anti-HEV IgG and HEV IgM in the tested serum samples. The water-borne nature of the epidemic was suggested by a study of the case distribution according to water supply. Prior to the epidemic, there had been an operational breakdown in a water treatment plant that distributed water to the affected areas while transforming its purification system from slow sand to rapid sand filtration. The primary source of water for the plant was derived from a heavily contaminated stream. The highest AR (16.3%) was observed in the areas where the source of drinking water was exclusively from the purification plant, followed by ARs of 12.4% and 5.3% for those receiving 50% and 30% or less of their water supply from the treatment plant, respectively, while the lowest AR (1.8%) was observed in the neighboring areas that did not receive water from this source. The AR was significantly higher in the group 11-30 years of age (15.3%) as compared with children less than 11 years of age (1.4%) and also relative to the group greater than 30 years of age (10.5%). The AR among the 162 recorded pregnant females was 21.6%, which was higher than that found among nonpregnant females of child-bearing age (10.9%). All four reported adult deaths occurred among females in their third trimester of pregnancy with a case fatality rate of 11.4%, while the other four fatal cases were newborn infants of mothers with acute icteric hepatitis. Although the aggregation of cases within households was significantly related to family size, the temporal relationship between cases in households with two or more cases revealed that 83.7% of 1,463 presumed secondary cases occurred within one month of the first case in the same household, which is not suggestive of person-to-person transmission of disease. The termination of providing water from the source was effected, which was followed by an apparent decrease in cases.

   in field isolates from coastal Kenya
AB We describe Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity in coastal Kenya, typing S-antigen and the merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (MSP-1 and MSP-2) in field isolates by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Malaria in coastal Kenya is characterized by low seasonal transmission, and a relatively high incidence of severe disease, which tends to occur in time-space clusters. We chose the highly polymorphic S-antigen as a marker for localized parasite diversity because it has been shown to vary in serotype prevalence in time and space. A total of 261 children (up to nine years of age) in two neighboring locations with different transmission rates were sampled for blood-stage parasites in cross-sectional surveys before and after the main transmission period in 1991, and also in a concomitant one-year longitudinal survey tracing clinical infections. Six major sequence types of S-antigen were identified, which were subdivided into 70 alleles; however, only 50% of isolates were typeable. The S-antigen sequence types varied qualitatively between locations, over time, and between asymptomatic and clinical disease infections, but not between different age groups. The MSP-1 and MSP-2 sequence type prevalences, in contrast, did not differ in any of these comparisons. We describe the use of the Mantel test for assessing clustering of individual parasite alleles at the household level, and demonstrate low-level clustering of MSP-1 and MSP-2 alleles and S-antigen sequence types, at the end of a long period of low transmission.

TI Conservation implications of host use for rare parasitic plants
AB Both the study and management of parasites have historically focused on the control, and even elimination, of parasite populations. In contrast, rare parasitic plants represent an uncommon challenge for conservation biologists and managers who often wish to bolster populations of these parasites. Although parasitic plants may suffer any of the maladies known to affect small populations of plants, parasitic plants may also be limited by the additional suite of factors of host availability, host quality, host resistance to parasitism, and parasite preference. We describe studies that have examined parasite growth and reproductive performance with a variety of host species to argue that consideration of the host needs of parasitic plants is necessary for successful conservation of rare species using this mode of resource acquisition. Although it is clear that parasite performance varies greatly with the availability of different host species, little is known about the host requirements of most parasitic plants, and the relative importance of particular host species may not immediately be obvious. Further, because published host lists generally do not distinguish minor hosts from those that sustain parasite populations, such lists may be misleading for conservation efforts. We argue that successful conservation and restoration of parasitic plants may necessitate the management of thoughtfully selected host populations.

   population where human immunodeficiency virus is highly prevalent
AB A retrospective study of notified hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Edinburgh during 1975-92 identified 525 acute cases. For 343 where a probable transmission route could be determined, 215 were due to shared equipment by injection drug users (IDUs), 29 to homosexual intercourse, 25 to heterosexual or household contact with IDUs, 21 to heterosexual contact with infected non-IDU partners and 53 to various other or multiple routes. Cases were unevenly distributed geographically, particularly those among IDUs. The highest incidence within a post code district was approximately 2.5 times that for all Edinburgh. Annual cases peaked in 1984 then declined to low levels in the early 1990s. This reduction was most marked among IDUs, and may be ascribed both to changed injecting behaviour and decreased susceptibility within this group. The latter factor implies that HBV infections may be an unreliable guide to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in populations where HBV is highly prevalent.

AB The purpose of the present paper is to document an initial attempt to quantify the influence of warming temperatures on the intensity and distribution of dengue transmission throughout the world using an expression of vectorial capacity modified to reflect the role of temperature on development and survival of the vector and virus. We rearranged the traditional vectorial capacity expression (the mean number of potentially infective contacts made by a mosquito population per infectious person per unit time) to develop an equation for the critical density threshold, an estimate of the number of adult female vectors required to just maintain the virus in a susceptible human population. In this expression, temperature influences adult survival, the lengths of the gonotrophic cycle and the extrinsic incubation period of the virus in the vector, and vector size, a factor that indirectly influences the biting rate. Before making projections for warming scenarios of current climate plus 2 or 4 degrees C, we validate our technique by successfully comparing model projections and the observed spatial, temporal, and altitudinal distribution of dengue using current climate in five cities that are endemic or have had epidemics in the past. Our results indicate that the current warming projection of the International Council of Scientific Unions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of 2 degrees C by the end of the next century can be expected to result in a potential increase in the latitudinal and altitudinal range of dengue; the potential duration of the transmission season will also increase in temperate locations as well. We discuss how an increase in temperature-related transmission intensity can be expected to lower the average ages of primary and secondary infections and thereby significantly increase the proportion of secondary infections occurring among infants and adolescents, the ages especially susceptible to dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome.

TI Evaluating the dynamics of coevolution among geographically structured
   populations
AB The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution suggests that reciprocal evolution involves three processes that operate among populations: selection mosaics, coevolutionary hotspots, and trait remixing. These processes, in turn, produce three patterns: population differences in traits favored by an interaction, a combination of trait matches and mismatches among populations, and few species-level coevolved traits (i.e., coevolved traits that have spread to all populations). Here I show how studies of the interactions between the pollinating floral parasite Greya politella and its host plants provide evidence for most of the components of this view of the coevolutionary process, including indications of the ecological conditions that can prevent coevolutionary change. These studies are suggesting that the dynamics of coevolution in these interactions are interpretable only when analyzed over broad geographic scales.

TI When is biological control evolutionarily stable (or is it)?
AB The evolution of resistance by insect and weed pests to chemical pesticides is a problem of increasing importance in applied ecology. It is striking that the evolution of resistance by target pest species in biological control is much less frequently reported, particularly in control involving parasitoids and predators, rather than pathogens. Although it is conceivable that this reflects biases in reporting or frequency of application, we suggest that there is a puzzle here worthy of scrutiny, and we outline several potential underlying causes. In order of discussion (not necessarily of importance), these are: (1) lack of genetic variation; (2) genetic constraints on selection; (3) weak selection; (4) temporally varying selection; and (5) coevolutionary dynamics. We, in particular, focus on the potential for weak selection on the host for increased resistance, despite effective control. The very spatial mechanisms (e.g., refuges, metapopulation dynamics) believed to facilitate the persistence of many natural enemy-victim systems with strong biological control may also incidentally provide an environment where selection is weak on target pests to evolve improved resistance to control agents, thereby biasing coevolution toward the enemy. The basic insight is that in a spatially heterogeneous environment, a strong limiting factor on a population can be a weak selective factor. The hypotheses presented here provide ingredients needed to predict which biological control systems might be evolutionarily stable, and which not. Our aim in this thought piece is to stimulate more attention to the evolutionary dimension of biological control systems.

TI Short report: Evidence of worldwide transmission of hepatitis G virus
AB Hepatitis G virus (HGV) has been recently documented in the Americas, Europe, and Australia. Distinct risk populations from North Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia were screened for HGV, in addition to hepatitis B and C viruses. First time recognition of HGV is described from Egypt and Indonesia. Notable is the high proportion of HGV positive individuals among multiply transfused children, ranging from 24% of those sampled from Egypt to 32% in Indonesia. Also, data from Peru suggest the likely association of HGV infection with progressive liver disease. Hepatitis G virus should be considered a world-wide health concern.

TI Spatial analysis of the distribution of lacrosse encephalitis in
   Illinois, using a geographic information system and local and global
   spatial statistics
AB The spatial and temporal distribution of LaCrosse encephalitis cases in Illinois was analyzed using a geographic information system (GIS) and spatial statistics. Case data were obtained from the Illinois Department of Public Health and mapped on the county, town, and address level. Human cases were concentrated in and around the city of Peoria in central Illinois. Local spatial statistics were used to identify hot spots where cases appear to be concentrated in the Peoria region. Several small towns surrounding the city of Peoria appeared as foci where cases were most common. Second-order spatial analysis of the case distribution was conducted on the address level. Cases were clustered within a range of 3.0 km in the city of Peoria. Since most cases appear to be associated with residential (peridomestic) exposure, and since several cases have been reported from neighboring addresses, transmission may be concentrated around specific sites (hardwood ravines, tire piles). The GIS and spatial analysis may be useful in identifying and targeting for intervention potential sites of enzootic transmission.

TI Predators, parasitoids, and pathogens as mortality agents in
   phytophagous insect populations
AB We compiled life tables for 78 holometabolous herbivorous insect species to quantify levels of apparent enemy-induced mortality of immature insects. Enemies were classified by type (predator, parasitoid, or pathogen), and mortalities caused by each type in each herbivore immature stage were tested with Analysis of Deviance for differences associated with four ecological characteristics of preadult herbivores: feeding biology, invasion status, and the cultivation status and latitudinal zone of the habitat. Total enemy-induced mortality is higher in the late developmental stages, and overall, parasitoids kill more herbivores than do either predators or pathogens. Among the ecological variables, both feeding biology and latitude showed significant enemy effects in at least one late developmental stage, whereas neither cultivation status nor invasion status was associated with enemy-induced mortality in any stage. Bonferroni adjustment of probabilities for multiple comparisons resulted in few significant interactions between enemy type and the ecological variables. However, raw probabilities and comparisons across herbivore immature stages suggest several patterns that deserve attention in future studies: (1)endophytic herbivores suffer lower mortality by predators and pathogens than exophytics, and endophytic leaf miners suffer the greatest parasitoid-induced mortality, while endophytic gallers/borers/root feeders suffer the least; (2) overall enemy-induced mortality is similar in natural and cultivated habitats; (3) exotic insects do not suffer lower enemy-induced mortality rates than natives; and (4) predation and disease may be greater in tropical/subtropical habitats, whereas parasitism is greater in the temperate zone. These results identify several general patterns in insect demographics that should be useful for hypothesis testing.

TI Emergence of new pathogens as a function of changes in host
   susceptibility
AB A pathogen may emerge as an important public health problem because of changes in itself or its transmission pathways. Alternatively, a microorganism may emerge as a pathogen or acquire new public health importance because of changes in host susceptibility to infection. Factors influencing host susceptibility within the population as a whole include increases in the number of immunocompromised patients; increased use of immunosuppressive agents, particularly among persons receiving cancer chemotherapy or undergoing organ transplantation; aging of the population; and malnutrition. In considering the emergence of foodborne pathogens and designing interventions to limit their spread, the susceptibility of these population subgroups to specific infections should be taken into account.

TI Anther-smut disease in Silene dioica: Variation in susceptibility among
   genotypes and populations, and patterns of disease within populations
AB In an archipelago in northern Sweden, populations of the perennial, dioecious, and insect-pollinated herb Silene dioica are commonly infected by the sterilising anther-smut fungus Microbotryum vioiaceum. The results from transplantation and inoculation experiments in this study show that variation between populations in the incidence of disease may partly be due to variation in resistance among populations. In the transplantation experiment in which plants were naturally exposed to the fungus, disease levels varied greatly among transplants from three healthy populations when transplanted to three diseased populations in the archipelago. Clear genotypic differences in susceptibility among 25 replicated genotypes of the host plants were found when inoculated manually with two different isolates. Susceptibility varied between 0-90%, but the two isolates used did not differ in inoculation success. The results also suggest a geographical structuring in resistance of the host and virulence of the fungus. First, disease levels among experimental plants from two of the disease-free populations of S. dioica (originating from inner and outer archipelago, respectively), were high when transplanted to a diseased population nearby, but low when transplanted far away. Second, regardless of origin, plants from all healthy populations became diseased in the diseased experimental populations located in the middle part of the archipelago. Due to isostatic land upheaval in the studied archipelago, there is a vertical age-axis within islands such that the highest point an an island is the oldest. Since this may affect the demography of the host, disease spread, and the dynamics of disease, spatial patterns in adult and seedling densities, and disease and spore deposition along the age-axis were studied within three diseased populations. A low incidence of disease was found in the young, low and old, high parts of the populations and a high incidence in the vertical, middle parts of the populations. The higher disease incidence in the middle part compared with the lower part of the population may reflect less disturbance and an increased probability of disease with age.

TI Experimental manipulation of putative selective agents provides evidence
   for the role of natural enemies in the evolution of plant defense
AB Although biologists have long assumed that plant resistance characters evolved under selection exerted by such natural enemies as herbivores and pathogens, experimental evidence for this assumption is sparse. We present evidence that natural enemies exert selection on particular plant resistance characters. Specifically, we demonstrate that elimination of natural enemies from an experimental field population of Arabidopsis thaliana alters the pattern of selection on genetic variation in two characters that have been shown to reduce herbivore damage in the field: total glucosinolate concentration and trichome density. The change in pattern of selection reveals that natural enemies imposed selection favoring increased glucosinolate concentration and increased trichome density, and thus, supports one of the major assumptions of the coevolution hypothesis. We also demonstrate that a pattern of stabilizing selection on glucosinolate concentration results from a balance between the costs and benefits associated with increasing levels of this resistance character. This result provides direct confirmation of the appropriateness of cost-benefit models for characterizing the evolution of plant defenses.

TI T lymphocytes and macrophages, but not motile spermatozoa, are a
   significant source of human immunodeficiency virus in semen
AB The cellular fraction of semen contains spermatozoa, immature germ cells, leukocytes, and epithelial cells. Recent evidence implicates seminal cells as a major source of sexually transmitted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in semen, but the identity and infectious potential of infected cells remains poorly understood. HIV provirus was found in 75% of viable semen cell samples by polymerase chain reaction and in 88% of paired blood cell samples from HIV-seropositive men. When semen cell subpopulations were isolated by an immunomagnetic bead technique, T cells were found to be most commonly HIV-infected (75% of samples), followed by macrophages (38% of samples). Viral DNA was never detected in motile spermatozoa or immature germ cell populations. Semen leukocytes proliferated in response to mitogenic and antigenic challenge and produced p24 following stimulation with irradiated allogeneic cells. These data provide evidence that both T cells and macrophages, but not germ cells, are cellular vectors of HIV transmission in semen.

TI The effect of cowpox virus infection on fecundity in bank voles and wood
   mice
AB Although epidemic infectious diseases are a recognized cause of changes in host population dynamics, there is little direct evidence for the effect of endemic infections on populations. Cowpox virus is an orthopoxvirus which is endemic in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and field voles (Microtus agrestis) in Great Britain. It does not cause obvious signs of disease nor does it affect survival, but in this study we demonstrate experimentally chat it can reduce the fecundity of bank voles and wood mice by increasing the time to first litter by 20-30 days. The pathogenic mechanisms causing this effect are at present not known, but this finding suggests that natural subclinical infection could have a considerable effect on the dynamics of wild populations.

   sporadic and consistent enzootic transmission
AB Sera from outpatients attending county health department clinics in areas of California with consistent (Imperial Valley) and sporadic (Sacramento Valley) enzootic transmission of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses exhibited neutralizing antibody prevalence rates of 1.3% (n = 690) and 0.5% (n = 1,066) for WEE and 11.0% and 0.8% for SLE, respectively. Seroprevalence for SLE virus in Imperial County increased as a function of both age and years of residence, indicating that this virus was endemic with a low rate of annual infection. Of 26 sera that tested positive for SLE virus antibody by an enzyme immunoassay, but were negative by plaque reduction neutralization test, 14 (53%) had neutralizing antibody that reacted with greater than or equal to one type of dengue (DEN) virus. The DEN virus infections presumably were acquired elsewhere because neither the vectors nor DEN virus transmission occurs in California. The low prevalence of neutralizing antibody for WEE and SLE in the California human population indicated that despite recent increases in enzootic transmission, contact between humans and infectious mosquitoes have remained low.

AB The natural history of Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium infections were determined in a cohort of 164 Bedouin children, from a population not previously studied, which is in transition from nomadism to a settled life style. Stools were sampled monthly from birth to two years of age and at all diarrhea episodes. The risk of infection with G. lamblia and Cryptosporidium infection by age two was 91.5% and 48.8%, respectively. Cryptosporidium prevalence was 3-4% at all ages, whereas G. lamblia prevalence was > 30% after age one. Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium asymptomatic detection rates were high, 28.5% and 1.6%, respectively. Detection of G. lamblia was higher in diarrhea episode samples obtained before six months of age, but after that age and overall, the detection was lower than in nondiarrhea samples (odds ratio [OR] = 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.7-0.9, P < 0.05). Detection rates of C. parvum were higher in episode-related samples in all age groups (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.9-4.2, P < 0.05) and infections in boys were more frequently symptomatic than in girls. While G. lamblia does not appear to be a consistent pathogen in this population where it is hyperendemic, Cryptosporidium has been shown to be an important cause of diarrhea in young children in the community.

   transmission and disease in a suburban area of Maputo, Mozambique
AB A temporal and spatial study of malaria transmission in a suburban area of Maputo, Mozambique with a mean population density of 2,737/km(2) was made from December 1992 to June 1995. A steep but continuous gradient was observed in the Plasmodium falciparum prevalence from 59.0% adjacent to the breeding sites to 5.4% only a few hundred meters distant. The entomologic inoculation rate ranged from a number too low to be determined in some districts to 20 infectious bites per person per year in the others. The risk of malaria was 6.2 times higher for individuals living less than 200 meters from the breeding sites than for individuals living 500 meters or more away from the breeding sites. In areas of high human density, mosquito and parasite dispersion is very limited, and therefore malaria control strategies could be more specifically targeted.

TI The transmission dynamics of antibiotic-resistant bacteria: the
   relationship between resistance in commensal organisms and antibiotic
   consumption
AB We propose a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of colonization by commensal bacteria within a human community subject to varying levels of antibiotic use designed to control morbidity induced by pathogenic strains of the normally commensal organisms. Colonization is assumed not to induce morbidity in the majority of cases, and antibiotic use is assumed to be related to the arrival and growth of pathogenic strains that give rise to infections including clinical symptoms of disease. In the absence of antibiotic resistance, the model shows how the pattern of antibiotic prescription and use can eliminate the non-pathogenic commensal strains from the host community if the fraction of people taking antibiotics with a defined efficacy exceeds some critical level. The model is extended to take account of the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the commensal population. We assume resistance may be either plasmid-mediated or conferred by selection of low-level pre-existing mutants, and that resistant organisms may experience reduced reproductive fitness. Invasion of the host community by drug-resistant commensals is possible ii. certain antibiotic prescribing patterns pertain. We calculate these conditions in terms of the transmission parameter of the organism and the level of antibiotic prescription and use. The model is employed to address the issues of how best to use antibiotics in populations harbouring resistant organisms, and when resistant bacteria will out-compete sensitive strains.

TI Host heterogeneity in susceptibility and disease dynamics: Tests of a
   mathematical model
AB Most mathematical models of disease assume that transmission is linearly dependent on the densities of host and pathogen. Recent data for animal diseases, however, have cast doubt on this assumption, without assessing the usefulness of alternative models. In this article, we use a combination of laboratory dose-response experiments, field transmission experiments, and observations of naturally occurring populations to show that virus transmission in gypsy moths is a nonlinear function of virus density, apparently because of heterogeneity among individual gypsy moth larvae in their susceptibility to the virus. Dose-response experiments showed that larvae from a laboratory colony of gypsy moths are substantially less heterogeneous in their susceptibility to the virus than are larvae from feral populations, and field experiments showed that there is a more strongly nonlinear relationship between transmission and virus density for feral larvae than for lab larvae. This nonlinearity in transmission changes the dynamics of the virus in natural populations so that a model incorporating host heterogeneity in susceptibility to the virus gives a much better fit to data on virus dynamics from large-scale field plots than does a classical model that ignores host heterogeneity. Our results suggest that heterogeneity among individuals has important effects on the dynamics of disease in insects at several spatial and temporal scales and that heterogeneity in susceptibility may be of general importance in the ecology of disease.

TI Genetic analysis of hybrid zones: Numbers of markers and power of
   resolution
AB The use of molecular genetic techniques is becoming increasingly widespread in analyses of hybrid zones. Yet, exactly how many molecular markers are required to provide a given degree of resolution remains an open question. We present statistical models that relate the number of markers examined to their power to discriminate between pure species, F1's, and backcross individuals. Our models indicate that only about four or five markers are required to provide a coarse classification of individuals in hybrid zones, whereas upwards of 70 markers are required to discriminate between pure species and advanced backcrosses. The models provide hybrid zone researchers a basis upon which to balance the time and expense of examining large numbers of markers against the magnitude of classification errors when smaller numbers of markers are examined.

AB A cluster of four cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome in children occurred in Northern Bohemia, Czech Republic, between 15 June and 7 July, 1995. All the cases had significantly elevated titres of anti-O157 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antibodies as detected by the indirect haemagglutination assay, All but one of them had drunk unpasteurized goat's milk from the same farm within the week before the disease. Evidence of E. coli O157 infection was subsequently found in 5 of 15 regular drinkers of the farm's raw goat's milk; four of them were asymptomatic, 1 had mild diarrhoea at the end of June. Verocytotoxin 2-producing E. coli O157:H7 strains of phage type 2 and of identical pulsed-held gel electrophoresis patterns were isolated from 1 of 2 farm goats and from 1 of the asymptomatic goat's milk drinkers. The frequency of anti-O157 LPS antibodies found among regular drinkers of the farm's raw goat's milk (33%; 5 of 15) was significantly higher than that found in control population (0%; none of 45) (P = 0.0005; Fisher's exact test). Our findings indicate that goats may be a reservoir of E. coli O157:H7 and a source of the infection for humans; raw goat's milk may serve as a vehicle of the pathogen transmission.

AB Seven-year-old Pinus sylvestris were studied in two field trials with respect to height growth and injury caused by the fungal pathogen Melampsora pinitorqua. Each trial comprised single-tree progenies from two to 11 parent trees from each of 45 pine populations in northern Sweden (open pollinated) and Finland (control pollinated with a pollen mixture from 22 north Swedish trees). Heritability estimates were in the range of 6-18%. Most of genetic variation in height growth and rust resistance in Swedish populations and in height growth in Finnish populations occurred within populations (86-100%). In populations of Finnish origin variation in rust resistance consisted of more equal among-and within-population components (68% and 32%, respectively). Family genetic correlations between pathogen resistance and tree height the previous year (disease-free environment) were positive among Finnish populations and Swedish coast populations, suggesting that pathogen resistance confers fitness benefits even in the absence of disease, whereas Swedish inland populations showed a negative correlation indicative of fitness costs. Patterns of genetic correlations at the population level tended to be just the reverse compared with those found at the family level. No genotype x trial interactions were detected for any of the examined characters. Prerequisites for establishment of a genecological balance between host and parasite are discussed.

TI The influence of host demography on the evolution of virulence of a
   microsporidian gut parasite
AB It is predicted that host exploitation should evolve to maximize parasite fitness and that virulence ( parasite-induced host mortality) evolves along with the rate of host exploitation. If the life expectancy of a parasite is short, it is expected to evolve a higher rate of host exploitation and therefore higher virulence because the penalty to the parasite for killing the host is reduced. We tested this hypothesis by keeping for 14 months the horizontally transmitted microsporidian parasite Glugoides intestinalis in mono-clonal host cultures (Daphnia magna) under conditions of high and low host background mortality. High host mortality, and thus parasite mortality, was achieved by replacing weekly 70-80% of all hosts in a culture with uninfected hosts from stock cultures (Replacement lines). In the low-mortality treatment no replacement took place. Contrary to our expectation, parasites from the Replacement lines evolved a lower within-host growth rate and virulence than parasites from the Nonreplacement lines. Across lines we found a strong positive correlation between within-host growth rate and virulence. We did further experiments to answer the question why our data did not support the predictions. Sporophorous vesicles (SVs, spore clusters) were smaller in doubly infected than in singly infected host-gut cells, indicating that competition within cells bears costs for the parasite. Due to our experimental protocol, the average Life span of infections had been much higher in the Nonreplacement lines. Since the number of parasites inside a host increases with the time since infection, long-lasting infections led to high frequencies of multiply infected host-gut cells. Therefore, we speculated that within-cell competition was more severe in the Nonreplacement fines and may have led to selection for accelerated within-host growth. SVs in the Nonreplacement fines were indeed significantly larger. Our results point out that single-factor explanations for the evolution of virulence can lead to wrong predictions and that multiple infections are an important factor in virulence evolution.

TI Natural polymorphism in the thrombospondin-related adhesive protein of
   Plasmodium falciparum
AB We have developed a typing system using natural sequence variation in the thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) gene of Plasmodium falciparum. This method permits a haplotype to be assigned to any particular TRAP gene, We have applied this method to a hospital-based, case control-study in Mall. Previous sequence variation and conservation in TRAP has been confirmed. Particular TRAP haplotypes can be used as geographic hallmarks. Because of the high level of conflict between characters, we have examined the phylogenetic relationships between parasites using a network approach. Having received patient samples from urban and periurban areas of Bamako, the majority of haplotypes were closely related and distinct from TRAP sequences present in other continents. This suggests that the structure of TRAP can only tolerate a limited number of sequence variations to preserve its function but that this is sufficient to allow the parasite to evade the host's immune system until a long-lived immune response can be maintained. It may also reflect host genetics in that certain variants may escape the host immune response more efficiently than others. For vaccine design, sequences from the major regional variants may need to be considered in the production of effective subunit vaccines.

TI Allocation to sexual versus nonsexual disease transmission
AB Many diseases have both sexual and nonsexual transmission routes, and closely related diseases often differ in their degree of sexual transmission. We investigate the evolution of transmission mode as a function of host social and mating structure using a model in which disease transmission is explicitly dependent on the numbers of sexual and nonsexual contacts (which are themselves a function of population density) and per-contact infection probabilities. Most generally, and in the absence of tradeoffs between the degree of sexual transmission and effects on host fecundity and mortality, nonsexual transmission is favored above the social-sexual crossover point (the host density at which the number of nonsexual contacts exceeds the number of sexual contacts), while sexual transmission is favored below this point. When changes in allocation to the two transmission modes are accompanied by changes in mortality or fecundity, both mixed and pure transmission strategies can be favored. If invading genotypes differ substantially from resident genotypes, genetic polymorphism in transmission mode is possible. The evolutionary outcomes are predictable from a knowledge of the equilibrium population sizes in relation to the social-sexual crossover point. Our results also show that predictions about dynamic outcomes, based on rates of invasion for single pathogens into healthy populations, do not adequately describe the resulting disease prevalence nor predict the subsequent evolutionary dynamics; once invasion of a pathogen has occurred, the conditions for spread of a second pathogen are themselves altered. If the host is considered as a single resource, our results show that two pathogens may coexist on a single resource ii they use that resource differentially and have differential feedbacks on resource abundance; such resource feedback effects map be present in other biological systems.

TI On the capacity of macroparasites to control insect populations
AB A graphical moder of the population dynamics of macroparasites and their hosts is developed. Three principal means by which the parasites can be regulated are considered: reduction in host density as a result of parasite-induced host mortality, reduc tion in host density as a result of parasite-induced host sterility, and competition among parasites within multiply-infected hosts. The means by which parasites are regulated has a major effect on the degree to which they can depress host population densities. In particular, a parasite that sterilizes its host is expected to reduce host density more than one that causes an equivalent decline in host fitness through increased mortality. A special case of the model is developed for herbivorous insects that, in the absence of parasites,are limited by larval food resources. Parasites that are regulated via parasite-induced host sterility will control the insect populations below the level set by larval resources if the threshold host density for the parasites (N-T) is less than the ratio of carrying capacity to net reproductive rate of the insects (K/R). Data are presented showing that all three means of parasite regulation, but especially parasite induced host sterility, can operate in Howardula aoronymphium, a nematode parasite of mycophagous Drosophila flies. Data from a field cage experiment show that, if these nematodes are regulated primarily via reductions in host density due to this sterility, the parameters N-T, K and R are such that Howardula is likely to play an important role in controlling Drosophila populations. However, this conclusion must be tempered by the fact that these nematodes also cause increased host mortality and experience within-host competition, making the conditions for parasite control of the flies more stringent.

   seal Phoca vitulina metapopulations
AB 1. This paper explores the concept of the critical community size for persistence of infection in wildlife populations. We use as a case study the 1988 epidemic of phocine distemper virus in the North Sea population of harbour seals, Phoca vitulina.
   2. We summarize the available data on this epidemic and use it to parameterize a stochastic compartmental model for an infection spreading through a spatial array of patches coupled by nearest-neighbour mixing, with replacement of susceptibles occurring as a discrete annual event.
   3. A combination of analytical and simulation techniques is used to show that the high levels of transmission between different seal subpopulations, combined with the small annual birth cohort, act to make persistence of infection impossible in this harbour seal population at realistic population levels. The well known mechanisms by which metapopulation structures may act to promote persistence can be seen to have an effect only at weaker levels of spatial coupling, and higher levels of host recruitment, than those empirically observed.

TI Population dynamics of the Indian meal moth: Demographic stochasticity
   and delayed regulatory mechanisms
AB 1. Laboratory populations of the Indian meal moth [Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)], undergo sustained periodic fluctuations in abundance. The period is just longer than the generation time. The fluctuations are accentuated in the presence of the P. interpunctella granulosis virus (PiGV).
   2. Time series spanning 8-10 generations from three replicate populations of the virus-free (VF) system and three from the virus-infected (VI) system are investigated using nonparametric autoregressive time series models.
   3. The dynamics are concluded to correspond to a third order process consistent with interactions in a three-dimensional stage-structured model for both systems. The functionally different interactive stages are believed to be the egg stage (preyed upon by larvae), small larvae (competing for resources and cannibalized by large larvae) and large larvae (competing for resources).
   4. The virus is seen as a modulator of the host vital rates more than an independent agent in a trophic host-pathogen interaction. The virus increases developmental time and decreases fecundity of the moths.
   5. A significantly nonlinear additive autoregressive model of order 3 appears to give a parsimonious description of the series.
   6. The demographic (birth and death) nature of the stochasticity inherent in the system is explicitly incorporated in the statistical model for the time series by assuming an overdispersed Poisson process. The variability around the skeleton is found to conform closely to this assumption. The demographic nature of the stochasticity cannot be fully understood on the basis of Gaussian (least-squares) models on transformed (variance-stabilized) data.
   7. Significant density dependencies are found at a 1-week lag, a 2- to 3-week lag and at a 6- to 7-week lag. These are argued to be the signatures of within-stage competition, between-stage interactions and reproduction, respectively. Negative and statistically significant density dependence is apparent for the first two of these. No significant negative density dependence is apparent in the lag:corresponding to reproduction.
   8. The fluctuations in both the VF and VI system appear to represent limit cycles or weakly dampened cycles clothed by Poisson demographic stochasticity.
   9. The enhanced cycles of the VI system are demonstrated to be consistent with a situation where the functional forms for the interactions are nearly the same as for the VF, but with delay structure shifted by just less than a week.

TI Protection against Leishmania major challenge infection in mice
   vaccinated with live recombinant parasites expressing a cytotoxic gene
AB A "suicide" system based on thymidine kinase-ganciclovir combination was developed and tested in a Leishmania major experimental model, Susceptible BALB/c mice were infected with L. major expressing the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 and treated for 2 consecutive weeks with 7.5 mg/kg/day ganciclovir at different times from the initial infection, Ganciclovir treatment at varying times after infection had different effects on the outcome of disease, A complete inhibition of intracellular parasites was obtained in mice treated 1 or 4 days after infection, whereas ganciclovir administration 2 weeks later resulted in the control of infection only when the drug was provided, Variable levels of protection, from partial to total, against challenge infection with virulent L, major were observed, depending on the timing of ganciclovir treatment. The thymidine kinase-ganciclovir approach represents an excellent experimental model to control Leishmania infection and to evaluate the immunologic response of the host.

TI Benefits of induced host responses against an ectoparasite
AB As a consequence of the deleterious effects of parasites on host fitness, hosts have evolved responses to minimize the negative impact of parasite infection. Facultative parasite-induced responses are favoured when the risk of infection is unpredictable and host responses are costly. In vertebrates, induced responses are generally viewed as being adaptive, although evidence for fitness benefits arising from these responses in natural host populations is lacking. Here we provide experimental evidence for direct reproductive benefits in flea-infested great tit nests arising from exposure during egg production to fleas. In the experiment we exposed a group of birds to fleas during egg laying (the exposed group), thereby allowing for induced responses, and kept another group free of parasites (the unexposed group) over the same time period. At the start of incubation, we killed the parasites in both groups and all nests were reinfested with fleas. If induced responses occur and are adaptive, we expect that birds of the exposed group mount earlier responses and achieve higher current reproductive success than birds in the unexposed group. In agreement with this prediction, our results show that birds with nests infested during egg-laying have (i) fewer breeding failures and raise a higher proportion of hatchlings to hedging age; () offspring that reach greater body mass, grow longer feathers, and hedge earlier, and (iii) a higher number of recruits and first-year grandchildren than unexposed birds. Flea reproduction and survival did not differ significantly between the two treatments. These results provide the first evidence for the occurrence and the adaptiveness of induced responses against a common ectoparasite in a wild population of vertebrates.

TI Modelling variability in lymphatic filariasis: macrofilarial dynamics in
   the Brugia pahangi cat model
AB A striking feature of lymphatic filariasis is the considerable heterogeneity in infection burden observed between hosts, which greatly complicates the analysis of the population dynamics of the disease. Here, we describe the first application of the moment closure equation approach to model the sources and the impact of this heterogeneity for macrofilarial population dynamics. The analysis is based on the closest laboratory equivalent of the Life cycle and immunology of infection in humans-cats chronically infected with the filarial nematode Brugia pahangi. Two sets of long-term experiments are analysed: hosts given either single primary infections or given repeat infections. We begin by quantifying changes in the mean and aggregation of adult parasites (inversely measured by the negative binomial parameter, kappa in cohorts of hosts using generalized linear models. We then apply simple stochastic models to interpret observed patterns. The models and empirical data indicate that parasite aggregation tracks the decline in the mean burden with host age in primary infections. Conversely, in repeat infections, aggregation increases as the worm burden declines with experience of infection. The results show that the primary infection variability is consistent with heterogeneities in parasite survival between hosts. By contrast, the models indicate that the reduction in parasite variability with time in repeat infections is most likely due to the 'filtering' effect of a strong, acquired immune response, which gradually acts to remove the initial variability generated by heterogeneities in larval mortality. We discuss this result in terms of the homogenizing effect of host immunity driven density-dependence on macrofilarial burden in older hosts.

TI Transmission intensity and Plasmodium falciparum diversity on the
   northwestern border of Thailand
AB Genetic analysis of the number of Plasmodium falciparum genotypes per infected person in regions of holoendemic and hyperendemic malaria suggest that in areas of lower transmission intensity, significantly fewer parasite genotypes per infected person should be found. A predominance of single clone infections in the human population could generate the controversial clonal population structure proposed for P. falciparum by Tibayrenc and others. Characterization of P. falciparum from individuals on the Thai-Burmese border, an area of hypoendemic transmission, revealed a higher number of genotypes per infected person than that predicted. Possible reasons for this observation are discussed, with particular attention;paid to human migration and multidrug resistance.

TI Schistosoma japonicum in the pig: The host-parasite relationship as
   influenced by the intensity and duration of experimental infection
AB Parasitologic, clinicopathologic, and pathologic aspects of Schistosoma japonicum infections of varying durations and intensities were studied in growing pigs injected intramuscularly with a dose of either 0, 100, 500, or 2,000 cercariae and killed at 4, 11, 17, or 24 weeks postinfection (PI). The number of viable worm pairs decreased significantly in the high dose group after 11 weeks PI but not in the lower dose groups; however, a stable population of immature worms persisted throughout the study in all dose groups. Liver egg counts also tended to decrease in the high dose group after 11 weeks but not in the other groups. Fecal egg excretion began at six weeks PI, was highest at eight weeks PI with a pronounced peak occurring only in the high dose group, and then decreased to low levels by 14 weeks PI in all groups. Egg counts from the feces as well as the liver correlated strongly with worm pair numbers during the acute phase of infection. The only clinicopathologic abnormality observed was an increase in circulating eosinophils corresponding to cercarial dose in all infected pigs by week six with peak counts occurring between six and eight weeks PI. The pigs exhibited no clinical signs of disease aside from diarrhea at the onset of patency. However, lesions were present throughout the large intestine of all infected pigs from 11 weeks PI, gradually decreasing with time. Severe liver fibrosis occurred in the 500 and 2,000 dose groups mainly at 11 weeks PI and then decreased in severity. In the Liver, but not in the intestine, the severity of lesions at all time points was proportional to the cercarial dose given. The results indicate that after several weeks of patency, pigs with high intensities of S. japonicum infection are able to effectively eliminate the majority of adult worms while maintaining a stable population of immature schistosomes.

TI Foodborne outbreaks of hepatitis A in a low endemic country: an emerging
   problem?
AB This paper describes 2 outbreaks of hepatitis A infection in Finland, a very low endemic area of hepatitis A infection, where a large proportion of the population is now susceptible to infection by hepatitis A virus (HAV). The first outbreak involved people attending several schools and day-care centres; the second employees of several bank branches in a different city. The initial investigation revealed that both were related to food distributed widely from separate central kitchens. Two separate case-control studies implicated imported salad food items as the most likely vehicle of infection. HAV was detected in the stool of cases from both outbreaks using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; however, comparison of viral genome sequences proved that the viruses were of different origin and hence the outbreaks, although occurring simultaneously, were not linked. Foodborne outbreaks of HAV may represent an increasing problem in populations not immune to HAV.

TI Parasitic infections among Southeast Asian labourers in Taiwan: a
   long-term study
AB Parasitic infections have been reported to be relatively common among the Southeast Asian labourers in Taiwan. This study, conducted in 1992-6, was designed to determine the temporal changes of the prevalence. Faecal specimens were examined by the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation technique and blood samples screened using the quantitative buffy coat technique and confirmed by Giemsa stained blood smear. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections was 10.3 %. The annual prevalence decreased from 33.3 % in 1992-3 to 4.6 % in 1995-6. The Thai (12.0 %) and Indonesian (11.1 %) had a higher prevalence than the Malaysian (6.7 %) and Filipinos (5.9 %). Opisthorchis viverrini was the most important parasite in the Thai and Trichuris trichiura in the remaining groups. Moreover: no blood parasites were found in the labourers. The dramatic temporal decline in the intestinal parasitic infections suggests that limiting the entry of infected persons, periodic follow-ups, and immediate treatment of sporadic cases are necessary in preventing transmission of non-indigenous parasites through large population change.

TI Age and movement of a hybrid zone: Implications for dispersal distance
   in pocket gophers and their chewing lice
AB Historical flood records for the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico suggest that a pocket gopher (Thomomys bonae) hybrid zone previously thought to be 10,000 years old may actually be closer to 50 years old. Measured zone width (defined genetically) is consistent with the hypothesis of recent contact, if we assume a reasonable dispersal distance of approximately 400 m/year for pocket gophers. A five-year study of movement of the contact zone between the two species of chewing lice that parasitize these pocket gophers also is consistent with the hypothesis of recent origin of the zone.

TI Effects of a fertility-reducing baculovirus on sperm numbers and sizes

AB 1. A dose-dependent decrease in male fertility occurs in the Indian Meal Moth, Plodia interpunctella, when sub-lethally infected with granulovirus during the larval stage,
   2. Here, the causes for this decline: are investigated by examining eupyrene and apyrene sperm numbers and sizes produced by males across four levels of viral challenge.
   3. The results. could not explain how reduced male fertility is caused in this host-pathogen interaction. While a reduction in both eupyrene and apyrene sperm numbers from all virus-treated males was found, this was not significant and neither was there a difference in sperm lengths across the four treatments, There were also no differences in the variances of sperm numbers or lengths between the doses, and no associations between sperm numbers or lengths and body size were found.
   4. A significant correlation between eupyrene and apyrene numbers was found, but this was independent of dose, Significant between-male variance in apyrene sperm lengths was found, indicating that individual males differ in the range of apyrene sperm sizes they produce.
   5. It is suggested that further intracellular and behavioural study is needed to identify the causes of the granulovirus-induced reduction in fertility of P. interpunctella.

   virus type 2 seropositivity among male factory workers in Zimbabwe
AB To determine the seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), to identify correlates of infection, and to describe the correlation with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity, 224 HIV-negative and 191 HIV-positive male factory workers in Zimbabwe were screened for HSV-2-specific antibodies. HSV-2 seroprevalence was 35.7% among HIV-negative subjects and 82.7% among MV-positive subjects. The weighted estimate of HSV-2 seroprevalence in this population is 44.6%. The correlation between HIV and HSV-2 remained significant after controlling for multiple sex partners, paying for sex, and history of sexually transmitted disease (adjusted odds ratio, 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.8-13.1). If the association between HSV-2 and HIV is causal, then the high seroprevalence of HIV and HSV-2 suggests that suppressive HSV-2 treatment should be considered as a strategy to reduce HIV transmission in this population. HSV-2 seroconversion may be a suitable surrogate end point to evaluate HIV prevention interventions.

TI Retroviruses and sexual size dimorphism in domestic cats (Felis catus
   L.)
AB Hochberg and co-workers have predicted that an increase in host adult mortality due to parasites is balanced by an earlier age at first reproduction. In polygynous species we hypothesize that such a pattern would lead to diverging selection pressure on body size between sexes and increased sexual size dimorphism. In polygynous mammals, male body size is considered to be an important factor for reproductive success. Thus, under the pressure of a virulent infection, males should be selected for rapid growth and/or higher body size to be able to compete successfully as soon as possible with opponents. In contrast, under the same selection pressure, females should be selected for lighter adult body size or rapid growth to reach sexual maturity earlier. We investigated this hypothesis in the domestic cat Felis catus. Orange cats have greater body size dimorphism than Iron-orange cats. Orange females are lighter than non-orange females, and orange males are heavier than non-orange males. Here, we report the extent to which orange and non-orange individuals differ in infection prevalence for two retroviruses, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). FIV is thought to be transmitted almost exclusively through aggressive contacts between individuals, whereas FeLV transmission occurs mainly through social contacts. The pattern of infection of both diseases is consistent with the higher aggressiveness of orange cats. In both sexes, orange cats are significantly more infected by FIV, and tend io be less infected by FeLV than other cats. The pattern of infection is also consistent with an earlier age at first reproduction in orange than in non-orange cats, at least for females. These results suggest that microparasitism may have played an important role in the evolution of sexual size dimorphism of domestic cats.

TI Coevolution of recovery ability and virulence
AB Most models for coevolution of hosts and parasites are based on the assumption that resistance of hosts to parasites is an all-or-nothing effect. In many cases, for example where parasites require an appropriate receptor on host cells, this is a reasonable assumption. However, in many other cases, for example where hosts mount an immune response, this picture may be too simple. An immune system is expensive to maintain, which poses a question as to how much of its resources a host should allocate to resist parasites: if the risk of infection is low, natural selection may favour hosts with less effective immune systems. As optimal allocation to defence will depend on the force of infection, and the force of infection, in turn, depends on the level of defence in the rest of the host population, a game-theoretic approach is necessary. Here I analyse a simple model for the evolution of the ability to recover from infection. If parasites are not allowed to coevolve, the outcome is a single evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). If the parasites coevolve, multiple evolutionary outcomes are possible, one in which the parasites are relatively avirulent and common and the hosts invest little in recovery ability, and another (the escalated arms race) where parasites are rare but virulent and the hosts invest heavily in defence.

TI Aedes aegypti survival and dispersal estimated by mark-release-recapture
   in northern Australia
AB The survival and dispersal of adult Aedes aegypti were estimated in northern Australia where sporadic outbreaks of Ae. aegypti-borne dengue viruses have occurred in recent years. Standard mark-release-recapture methods were used. In addition, a new sticky trap was used to capture the mosquitoes. Prior to the field study, the survival and effect of marking Ae. aegypti with fluorescent powder were determined in the laboratory. Mortality was age-dependent and the marked cohorts had higher survival rates than the untreated cohorts. Recapture rates of 13.0% and 3.6% over a seven-day period were achieved for two batches of marked Ae. aegypti released simultaneously at the field site. More males than females were recaptured although the proportion of females increased with time. The probability of daily survival was 0.91 and 0.86 for the blue-and pink-marked females, respectively, and 0.57 and 0.70 for the blue-and pink-marked and males, respectively. The mean distance traveled of recaptured Ae. aegypti was 56 m and 35 m for females and males, respectively. The maximum observed distance traveled of 160 m was the same for both sexes. The warm to hot and dry climatic conditions may have restricted the dispersal of released mosquitoes in this study. The frequency of recaptures at certain trap locations suggested that shade, wind, and the availability of hosts affected the distribution of Ae. aegypti within the study site.

TI Evolution of pest-induced defenses in Brassica plants: Tests of theory
AB Theory on the evolution of pest-induced defenses in plants predicts (1) a negative genetic correlation between induced and constitutive (basal) levels of secondary metabolites, and (2) costs of maintaining high constitutive levels of secondary metabolites. We tested these predictions with genetically diverged populations created by artificial selection on myrosinase and glucosinolate levels in Brassica mpa. Glucosinolates and their breakdown products from the action of the enzyme myrosinase are putative defensive compounds in brassicas. Theory also suggests that effects of genetic changes in secondary metabolites may depend on resource availability, so nitrogen, a main constituent of glucosinolates and myrosinase was added in fertilizer treatments to assess costs. We used the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans and diamondback moth larvae Plutella xylostella as induction agents in comparisons of the diverged myrosinase populations, We found pleiotropic effects among constitutive myrosinase levels and pathogen-induced levels of myrosinase, glucosinolates, and resistance to diamondback moth larvae. In field experiments, genetic increases in myrosinase production were associated with significant decreases in estimated seed production, despite potential benefits from increased resistance to flea beetles Phylotreta cruciferae. No genotype-by-nitrogen interaction was found. Although costs were detected, our results indicate, in contrast to theory, mainly positive pleiotropic effects between constitutive levels of secondary metabolites and induced responses.

TI Dengue fever epidemic potential as projected by general circulation
   models of global climate change
AB Climate factors influence the transmission of dengue fever, the world's most widespread vector-borne virus. We examined the potential added risk posed by global climate change on dengue transmission using computer-based simulation analysis to link temperature output from three climate general circulation models (GCMs) to a dengue vectorial capacity equation. Our outcome measure, epidemic potential, is the reciprocal of the critical mosquito density threshold of the vectorial capacity equation. An increase in epidemic potential indicates that a smaller number of mosquitoes can maintain a state of endemicity of disease where dengue virus is introduced. Baseline climate data for comparison are from 1931 to 1980. Among the three GCMs, the average projected temperature elevation was 1.16 degrees C, expected by the year 2050. All three GCMs projected a temperature-related increase in potential seasonal transmission in five selected cities, as well as an increase in global epidemic potential, with the largest area change occurring in temper ate regions. For regions already at risk, the aggregate epidemic potential across the three scenarios rose on average between 31 and 47% (range, 24-74%). If climate change occurs, as many climatologists believe, this will increase the epidemic potential of dengue-carrying mosquitoes, given viral introduction and susceptible human populations. Our risk assessment suggests that increased incidence map first occur in regions bordering: endemic zones in latitude or altitude. Endemic locations may be at higher risk from hemorrhagic dengue if transmission intensity increases.

TI A castration parasite of an ant-plant mutualism
AB Exploring the factors governing the maintenance and breakdown of cooperation between mutualists is an intriguing and enduring problem for evolutionary ecology, and symbioses between ants and plants can provide useful experimental models for such studies. Hundreds of tropical plant species have evolved structures to house and feed ants, and these ant-plant symbioses have long been considered classic examples of mutualism. Here, we report that the primary ant symbiont, Allomerus cf. demerarae, of the most abundant ant-plant found in south-east Peru, Cordia nodosa Lam., castrates its host plant. Allomerus workers protect new leaves and their associated domatia from herbivory, but destroy flowers, reducing fruit production to zero in most host plants. Castrated plants occupied by Allomerus provide more domatia for their associated ants than plants occupied by three species of Azteca ants that do not castrate their hosts. Allomerus colonies in larger plants have higher fecundity. As a consequence, Allomerus appears to benefit from its castration behaviour, to the detriment of C. nodosa. The C. nodosa-ant system exhibits none of the retaliatory or filtering mechanisms shown to stabilize cheating in other cooperative systems, and appears to persist because some of the plants, albeit a small;minority, are inhabited by the three species of truly mutualistic Azteca ants.

TI Phylogeny and PCR-based classification of Wolbachia strains using wsp
   gene sequences
AB Wolbachia are a group of intracellular inherited bacteria chat infect a wide range of arthropods. They are associated with a number of different reproductive phenotypes in their hosts, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis and feminization. While it is known that the bacterial strains responsible for these different host phenotypes form a single clade within the cl-Proteobacteria, until now it has not been possible to resolve the evolutionary relationships between different Wolbachia strains. To address this issue we have cloned and sequenced a gene encoding a surface protein of Wolbachia (wsp) from a representative sample of 28 Wolbachia strains. The sequences from this gene were highly variable and could be used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of different Wolbachia strains. Based on the sequence of the wsp gene from different Wolbachia isolates we propose that the Wolbachia pipientis clade be initially divided into 12 groups. As more sequence information becomes available we expect the number of such groups to increase. In addition, we present a method of Wolbachia classification based on the use of group-specific wsp polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers which will allow Wolbachia isolates to be typed without the need to clone and sequence individual Wolbachia genes. This system should facilitate future studies investigating the distribution and biology of Wolbachia strains from large samples of different host species.

TI The acquisition of hypovirulence in host-pathogen systems with three
   trophic levels
AB A major focus of research on the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions has been the evolution of pathogen virulence, which is defined as the loss in host fitness due to infection. It is usually assumed that changes in pathogen virulence are the result of selection to increase pathogen fitness. However, in some cases, pathogens have acquired hypovirulence by themselves becoming infected with hyperparasites. For example, the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica has become hypovirulent in some areas by acquiring a double-stranded RNA hyperparasite that debilitates the pathogen, thereby reducing its virulence to the host. In this article, we develop and analyze a mathematical model of the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions with three trophic levels. The system may be dominated by either uninfected (virulent) or hyperparasitized (hypovirulent) pathogens, or by a mixture of the two. Hypovirulence may allow some recovery of the host population, but it can also harm the host population if the hyperparasite moves the transmission rate of the pathogen closer to its evolutionarily stable strategy. In the latter case, the hyperparasite is effectively a mutualist of the pathogen. Selection among hyperparasites will often minimize the deleterious effects, or maximize the beneficial effects,, of the hyperparasite on the pathogen. Increasing the frequency of multiple infections of the same host individual promotes the acquisition of hypovirulence by increasing the opportunity for horizontal transmission of the hyperparasite. This effect opposes the usual theoretical expectation that multiple injections promote the evolution of more virulent pathogens via selection for rapid growth within hosts.

TI Effects of a tapeworm parasite on the competition of Tribolium beetles
AB The effect of parasites on host community structure and biodiversity is an important issue of community ecology. Both verbal and mathematical models suggest that host species with higher fitness costs associated with parasitism should bear a competitive disadvantage in the presence of parasites. However, few rigorous empirical tests exist. This study examined the effects of a tapeworm parasite (Hymenolepis diminuta) on competition between two flour beetle species (Tribolium confusum and T. castaneum). The flour beetles are the intermediate host of this rat tapeworm parasite. Previous studies demonstrated that T. castaneum is usually the superior competitor in competition with T. confusum in parasite-free environments. However, because T. castaneum is more susceptible to parasitism and shows higher fitness costs when infected than T. confusum, we expected that T. castaneum would bear a competitive disadvantage in the presence of the parasite. In contrast, we found that tapeworm infection significantly increased the likelihood of T. castaneum winning the competition, reduced the time needed for T. castaneum to win, and increased T. castaneum population density compared to parasite-free populations. Therefore, our results suggest that the tapeworm infection confers some advantage to T. castaneum and are in contrast to the expectation based on mathematical studies and verbal arguments. Disagreements between experimental results and the hypothesized predictions probably reflect the effect of parasite-induced changes in intraguild predation. Our results suggest that theories on parasite effects of competition need to consider the complex nature of host-parasite associations, including the effect of parasites on host behaviors.

TI Foliage damage does not affect within-season transmission of an insect
   virus
AB Gypsy moth defoliation of oak trees has been shown to lead to increased tannin levels, which, in turn, lead to reduced gypsy moth growth and fecundity. In laboratory experiments, increased tannin levels can interfere with the transmission of a virus that is consumed by larvae on oak foliage, and high mortality rates of larvae in the field are sometimes associated with low levels of defoliation. These latter results have led to the suggestion that gypsy moth defoliation may cause reduced mortality attributable to the virus by elevating oak tannin levels. In a series of field experiments, we directly tested the hypothesis that gypsy moth defoliation of oaks leads to reduced virus transmission rates. In each of three study years, in oak forests with almost no naturally occurring gypsy moths or virus, we measured virus transmission rates in gypsy moths feeding on oaks, with and without experimental defoliation. By carefully synchronizing our experiments with the phenology of natural gypsy moth populations, we mimicked natural virus transmission processes during that part of the gypsy moth life cycle when virus transmission occurs. In our experiments, there was no effect of gypsy moth defoliation on tannin levels; consequently, virus transmission in both the held and the lab was unaffected by defoliation. Although we did observe increased tannin levels on more severely defoliated oak trees in one of two naturally defoliated oak stands late in the season, virus transmission had virtually ceased by that time. Our results suggest that gypsy moth defoliation does not affect tannin levels early enough in the larval season to have a measurable effect on the interaction between the gypsy moth and its nuclear polyhedrosis virus.

Primates can act as reservoirs for human pathogens. As members of biologically diverse habitats, they serve as sentinels for surveillance of emerging pathogens and provide models for basic research on natural transmission dynamics. Since emerging infectious diseases also pose serious threats to endangered and threatened primate species, studies of these diseases in primate populations can benefit conservation efforts and may provide the missing link between laboratory studies and the well-recognized needs of early disease detection, identification, and surveillance.

AB Molecular epidemiologic studies of infectious diseases rely on pathogen genotype comparisons, which usually yield patterns comprising sets of DNA fragments (DNA fingerprints). We use a highly developed genotyping system, IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to develop a computational method that automates comparison of targe numbers of fingerprints. Because error in fragment length measurements is proportional to fragment length and is positively correlated for fragments within a lane, an align-and-count method that compensates for relative scaling of lanes reliably counts matching fragments between lanes. Results of a two-step method we developed to cluster identical fingerprints agree closely with 5 years of computer-assisted visual matching among 1,335 M. tuberculosis fingerprints. Fully documented and validated methods of automated comparison and clustering will greatly expand the scope of molecular epidemiology.

TI Virulence of mixed-clone and single-clone infections of the rodent
   malaria Plasmodium chabaudi
AB Most evolutionary models treat virulence as an unavoidable consequence of microparasite replication and have predicted that in mixed-genotype infections, natural selection should favor higher levels of virulence than is optimal in genetically uniform infections. Increased virulence may evolve as a genetically fixed strategy, appropriate for the frequency of mixed infections in the population, or may occur as a conditional response to mixed infection, that is, a facultative strategy. Here we test whether facultative alterations in replication rates in the presence of competing genotypes occur and generate greater virulence. An important alternative, not currently incorporated in models of the evolution of virulence, is that host responses mounted against genetically diverse parasites may be more costly or less effective than those against genetically uniform parasites. If so, mixed clone infections will be more virulent for a given parasite replication rate.
   Two groups of mice were infected with one of two clones of Plasmodium chabaudi parasites, and three groups of mice were infected with 1:9, 5:5, or 9:1 mixtures of the same two clones. Virulence was assessed by monitoring mouse body weight and red blood cell density. Transmission stage densities were significantly higher in mixed-than in single-clone infections. Within treatment groups, transmission stage production increased with the virulence of the infection, a phenotypic correlation consistent with the genetic correlation assumed by much of the theoretical work on the evolution of virulence. Consistent with theoretical predictions of facultative alterations in virulence, we found that mice infected with both parasite clones lost more weight and had on average lower blood counts than those infected with single-clone infections. However, there was no consistent evidence of the mechanism invoked by evolutionary models that predict this effect. Replication rates and parasite densities were not always higher in mixed-clone infections, and for a given replication rate or parasite density, mixed-clone infections were still more virulent. Instead, prolonged anemia and increased transmission may have occured because genetically diverse infections are less rapidly cleared by hosts. Differences in maximum weight loss occured even when there were comparable parasite densities in mixed-and single-clone infections. We suggest that mounting an immune response against more that one genotype is more costly for hosts, which therefore suffer higher virulence.

Koala population persistence was most sensitive to reduced annual survivorship of adults (4-10-year-old males and 2-12-year-old females), highlighting the need for accurate field estimates of adult survivorship in order to assess Chlamydia's impact on specific populations.

If koalas become less resistant to disease in fragmented, high-stress habitats (i.e. experience increased Chlamydia-induced mortality and sterility rates), Chlamydia is not predicted to cause koala extinctions under most conditions. Extinctions are only predicted if Chlamydia transmission rates also increase (e.g. due to new transmission pathways or increased mating frequency), or other non-disease factors change birth and mortality rates to reduce the koala population's intrinsic rate of increase below 0.1,
   5, The most important predicted effect of habitat fragmentation and other forms of human disturbance on this unique host-parasite relationship is the extinction of Chlamydia in populations where koala resistance to disease decreases.

TI Emergence of drug resistance during an influenza epidemic: Insights from
   a mathematical model
AB A model was developed for the emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses during a closed population influenza epidemic that occurs in a single wave. The model was used to consider several treatment and chemoprophylaxis strategies and to determine their effects on the spread of the infection. The model predicts frequent emergence and transmission of drug-resistant viruses with certain treatment scenarios. According to the model, chemoprophylaxis of susceptible persons (without treatment of those who are symptomatic) may be the best way to reduce the force of an epidemic and to keep development of drug resistance low. The model predictions indicate that the relative transmissibility of resistant variants compared with wild type virus and the choice of the treatment or chemoprophylaxis strategy can be decisive for the spread of drug-resistant viruses, a feature that may be crucial in a pandemic.
