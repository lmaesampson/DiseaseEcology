TI Dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis across the San Francisco Bay
   area
AB The propensity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes to spread across geographic boundaries was investigated by comparing the IS6110 and polymorphic GC-rich sequence patterns of M. tuberculosis isolates from San Francisco and the East Bay, two distinct regions separated by San Francisco Bay. Of 724 isolates from incident tuberculosis patients during 1992 and 1993, only 53 (7.3%) had patterns matching greater than or equal to 1 isolates from the other region. In the multivariable analysis of patient risk factors, an AIDS diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-3.57) and non-Asian race (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.59-7.42) were associated with having an isolate with a matching pattern. Of 375 unique IS6110 patterns among San Francisco isolates, only 9 (2.4%) matched patterns of East Bay isolates. These population-based data suggest that in the San Francisco Bay Area, M. tuberculosis does not rapidly spread across geographic boundaries, and tuberculosis control efforts should focus on transmission within defined areas.

TI The population genetic structure of the facultatively sexual parasitic
   nematode Strongyloides ratti in wild rats
AB We have investigated the population genetic structure of the parasitic nematode Strongyloides ratti in wild rats. In the UK, S. ratti reproduces predominantly by mitotic parthenogenesis, with sexual forms present at a rate of less than 1%. S. ratti was found to be a prevalent parasite and substantial genetic diversity was detected. Most rats were infected with a genotypic mixture of parasites. A hierarchical analysis of the genetic variation found in S. ratti sampled across Britain and Germany showed that 73.3% was explained by variation between parasites within individual hosts and 25.3% by variation between rats within sample sites. Only a small proportion (1.4%) of the total genetic variation was attributable to genetic subdivision between sample sites, suggesting that there is substantial gene flow between these sites. Most parasites sampled were found to exist in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and this population genetic structure is discussed in view of the virtual absence of sexual reproduction.

TI Long-term survival of children with human immunodeficiency virus
   infection in New York City: Estimates from population-based surveillance
   data
AB The life expectancy of children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection acquired through mother-to-child transmission has important clinical and public health significance, Several sources of population-based surveillance data from New York City, covering 1982 through the end of 1994, were combined to estimate long-term survival of HIV-infected children and age-specific prevalence. HIV incidence among newborns was estimated by applying expected transmission rates to seroprevalence surveys of parturient women and by using back-calculation methods. HIV prevalence in childhood was based on cumulative HIV incidence and cumulative mortality, adjusting for underreporting of death and background causes of death. A modified actuarial method was developed to estimate survival of infected children. At the beginning of 1995, between 1,945 and 3,323 children less than age 13 years were estimated to be living with HIV infection acquired through mother-to-child transmission in New York City. Between 36% and 61% of these infected children were estimated to survive to age 13 years (median survival, 8.6 years to >13 years). A substantial proportion of infected children will survive to adolescence, Thus, it is important that their educational, medical, and other needs be considered. These methods may be useful in other areas in which HIV seroprevalence data among childbearing women and HIV mortality statistics are available.

TI Monitoring of dengue viruses in field-caught Aedes aegypti and Aedes
   albopictus mosquitoes by a type-specific polymerase chain reaction and
   cycle sequencing
AB Virologic surveillance for dengue through the detection of the prevalent serotype(s) circulating in the human population during inter-and intra-epidemic periods constitutes a reliable sentinel system for dengue outbreaks. We have applied a rapid and sensitive, semi-nested, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using nonstructural protein 3 gene primers for the type-specific-detection of dengue viruses in artificially infected and in field-caught adult Aedes mosquitoes. In laboratory experiments, the assay was sensitive enough to detect one virus infected mosquito head in pools of up to 59 uninfected heads. In a prospective held study conducted from April 1995 to July 1996, female adult Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were caught from selected dengue-sensitive areas in Singapore and assayed by RT-PCR. Approximately 20% of 309 mosquito pools were positive for dengue viruses. Of the 23 RT-PCR-positive Ae. aegypti pools (containing 1-17 mosquitoes each), 18 pools (78.3%) were positive for dengue 1 virus. There were 40 RT-PCR-positive Ae. albopictus pools (containing 1-33 mosquitoes each) of which 31 (77.5%) were positive for dengue 1 virus. The predominant virus type responsible for the current dengue epidemic since 1995 was also dengue 1. The geographic locations of the virus-infected mosquitoes correlated with the residences or workplaces of patients within dengue outbreak areas. A total of 43.5% of the positive Ae. aegypti pools and 25.0% of the positive Ae. albopictus pools contained only a single mosquito. Both Aedes species showed similar overall minimum infection rates of 57.6 and 50 per 1,000 mosquitoes. Infected Ae. aegypti were detected as early as six weeks before the start of the dengue outbreaks in 1995 and 1996. However, infected Ae. albopictus appeared later, when the number of cases was increasing. Virologic surveillance by RT-PCR for detecting dengue virus-infected Aedes mosquitoes in the field may serve as an early warning monitoring system for dengue outbreaks.

TI Eradication of latent Epstein-Barr virus by hydroxyurea alters the
   growth-transformed cell phenotype
AB The hallmark of infection by human herpesviruses, life-long persistence in the host, is unaffected by current antiviral therapies effective against replication of virus. In vitro studies indicated that low concentrations of the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, hydroxyurea, completely eliminated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) episomes from latently infected Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell subsets, providing the first example of chemotherapeutic eradication of a latent herpesvirus from any cell population. Unlike parental EBV-positive BL cells. virus-free cell progeny from one treated cell line no longer exhibited the malignant phenotype in tumorigenicity assays. Hydroxyurea-treated primary B lymphocytes immortalized by EBV ceased to proliferate as episomes were lost. The altered growth phenotype of both BL cells and immortalized primary B cells suggests that latent EBV is an appropriate and accessible therapeutic target for treatment of some EBV-induced lymphoproliferations.

TI Neonatal fulminant hepatitis B: Structural and functional analysis of
   complete hepatitis B virus genomes from mother and infant
AB Transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from anti-hepatitis B e (anti-HBe)-positive carrier mothers to their infants mag. result in neonatal fulminant hepatitis B (FHB), We investigated whether HBV variants with a particular DNA sequence and functional phenotype, responsible for FHB, are selected during transmission. Full-length HBV genomes from a mother-infant pair were completely sequenced and transfected into human hepatoma cells. The dominant neonatal and maternal HBV populations were nearly identical (homology 99.8%) and showed a precore stop codon mutation, T-1762 and A-1764 substitutions in the core promoter region, and pre-S2 start codon mutations. Cells transfected with variants from mother and child, compared with wild-type virus, synthesized and released a similar number or fewer HBV DNA-containing particles. In conclusion, no particular HBV strain emerged during neonatal FHB. In this case, a de novo infection with variants showing a defect in HBe antigen and pre-S2 protein synthesis but not a high replication competence probably contributed to the fulminant disease course.

TI Surveillance for Ross River virus infection using blood donors
AB The number of clinical Ross River virus (RRV) infections (epidemic polyarthritis) each year in Australia continues to grow despite extensive vector control pro,srams. There is a need, therefore, for a surveillance program that can give sufficient warning of outbreaks of the disease so that highly focused preventative measures may be undertaken. The ability of a surveillance program, based on voluntary Red Cross blood donations, to predict outbreaks of epidemic polyarthritis was evaluated. Anti-RRV IgM antibody was detected in significant numbers of blood donors from throughout the state of Queensland 6-9 weeks prior to an increase in the number of notified cases of epidemic polyarthritis. At a local level, significant numbers of anti-RRV IgM blood donors were detected in Brisbane in 1996 four weeks prior to an increase in the number of notified cases of epidemic polyarthritis. This system of surveillance is technically simple, rapid (results are obtained in 2-3 days), it samples the human population from throughout the state, and it gives timely warning of outbreaks of epidemic polyarthritis.

TI Parasite abundance, body size, life histories, and the energetic
   equivalence rule
AB If common processes generate size-abundance relationships among all animals, then similar patterns should be observed across groups with different ecologies, such as parasites and free-living animals. We studied relationships among body size. life-history traits, and population intensity (density in infected hosts) among nematodes parasitizing mammals. Parasite size and intensity were negatively correlated independently of all other parasite and host factors considered and regardless of type of analyses (i.e., nonphylogenetic or phylogenetically based statistical analyses, and across or within communities). No other nematode Life-history traits had independent effects on intensity. Slopes of size-intensity relationships were consistently shallow, around -0.20 on log-log scale, and thus inconsistent with the energetic equivalence rule. Within communities, slopes converged toward this global value as size range increased. A summary of published values suggests similar convergence toward a global value around -0.75 among free-living animals. Steeper slopes of size-abundance relationships among free-living animals could be related to fundamental differences in ecologies between parasites and free-living animals, although such generalizations require reexamination of size-abundance relationships among free-living animals with regard to confounding factors, in particular by use of phylogenetically based statistical methods. In any case, our analyses caution against simple generalizations about patterns of animal abundance.

TI Do parasitism and nutritional status interact to affect production in
   snowshoe hares?
AB We evaluated the hypothesis that the effects of parasitism on animal body condition are accentuated when host nutritional status is compromised. In a field experiment we manipulated natural burdens of five nematode species via anthelmintic treatment in one-half the free-ranging snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) on each of six study areas and supplemented overwinter food level on three areas, to assess whether treatments interacted synergistically. We predicted that the effects of parasitism would be aggravated in malnourished hares (i.e., hares not administered supplemental food), and that animals receiving both treatments would have (1) lower parasite burdens, and (2) higher body mass, fat storage, and reproduction, than those receiving only one or no treatments. Mean numbers of Trichuris leporis were lower in hares subjected to food supplementation, suggesting that nutritional status affected immunity to that species. Obeliscoides cuniculi, Nematodirus triangularis, Dirofilaria scapiceps, and Protostrongylus boughtoni numbers were not directly affected by supplementation. Body mass of parasite-normal controls (i.e., not administered the anthelmintic treatment) was negatively correlated to nematode abundance during May-June, implying that parasitism had a deleterious effect on hare mass at that time. However, the anthelmintic treatment failed to directly affect hare body mass, fat storage, or reproduction. Food supplementation had a positive effect on body mass, fat storage, and reproduction, although effects of food were neither strong nor consistent among study areas and body condition parameters being measured. Only 2 of 22 analyses of hare production yielded marginally significant (i.e., 0.05 < P < 0.10) interactions between food and parasitism; therefore, we concluded that the two factors were not strongly linked. However, because our snowshoe hare population was at low densities and likely exposed to neither severe food shortage nor high rates of nematode parasitism, failure to detect an interaction between treatments may not comprise a general refutation of the hypothesis. Rather, hare populations subject to more serious food limitation (i.e., during a cyclic peak in numbers) may be apt to display stronger interactions between nutrition and parasitism.

TI General-purpose genotypes for host species utilization in a nematode
   parasite of Drosophila
AB The nematode Howardula aoronymphium parasitizes several species of mushroom-feeding Drosophila. A survey of isofemale strains of H. aoronymphium and a 25-generation selection experiment revealed that this species does not comprise host races, and that it harbors little heritable variation for adaptation to specific hosts. No tradeoffs in performance on the different host species were evident. General-purpose genotypes, which can utilize all host species, characterize H. aoronymphium. An important feature of the natural history of these nematodes-correlated epidemiology across host species - is postulated to be both a cause and a consequence of the evolution of general-purpose genotypes in this species.

TI Reliability of self-reported sexual behavior in human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV) concordant and discordant heterosexual couples in northern
   Thailand
AB A partner study was conducted in northern Thailand between March 1992 and June 1996 which included data that allowed an assessment of the reliability of self-reports of sexual behavior and contraceptive use among heterosexual couples. The authors enrolled 529 couples among whom all male subjects were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive voluntary blood donors and their female sexual partners were either HIV infected (n = 246) or HIV seronegative (n = 283). The levels of agreement within couples were assessed for recency of last sexual intercourse, sexual activity in the prior year, and contraceptive practices. For HIV discordant couples, a prospective study was conducted to examine risk factors for HIV transmission, the primary goal of the study. This allowed assessment of reliability of inter-partner reports over 6-12 months. Overall, agreement among couples was good for common sexual practices, especially vaginal intercourse and time since last intercourse, but was lower for condom use. Anal and oral sex were infrequently reported by these couples and there was greater disagreement for the occurrence of these practices. Partner agreement for contraceptive histories was good to excellent. Prospective data showed less frequent intercourse and more condom use but reliability remained good. Common sexual practices may be reliable for both HIV concordant and discordant couples in studies estimating prevalent infection. Estimates of incident heterosexually transmitted HIV may be made with greater reliability by studies which include assessment of reports of risk behavior by each member of a couple than studies of individuals.

TI Alternative hypotheses linking the immune system and mate choice for
   good genes
AB Why do males often have extravagant morphological and behavioural traits, and why do females prefer to mate with such males? The answers have been the focus of considerable debate since Darwin's The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex appeared in 1871. Recently, the broadening of investigation to include fields outside evolutionary biology has shed new light on mate choice and sexual selection. Here, we focus on a specific set of hypotheses relating the biology of resisting disease-causing organisms with the production of condition-dependent sexual signals (advertisements). We present a framework that distinguishes three different hypotheses about trade-offs within the immune system that affect general condition. The original Hamilton & Zuk hypothesis suggests that hosts fight off disease via resistance to particular pathogens, which lowers resistance to other pathogens. Changes in pathogens over evolutionary time in turn favours changes in which genes confer the best resistance. Alternatively, the immunocompetence hypotheses suggest that the energetic costs of mounting a response to any pathogen compete for resources with other things, such as producing or maintaining advertisements. Finally, improving resistance to pathogens could increase the negative impacts of the immune system on the host, via immunopathologies such as allergies or autoimmune diseases. If both disease and immunopathology affect condition, then sexual advertisements could signal a balance between the two. Studies of hypothesized links between genes, condition, the immune system and advertisements will require careful consideration of which hypothesis is being considered, and may necessitate different measures of immune system responses and different experimental protocols.

TI Wolbachia-induced thelytoky in the rose gallwasp Diplolepis
   spinosissimae (Giraud) (Hymenoptera : Cynipidae), and its consequences
   on the genetic structure of its host
AB Cynipids are known to use various reproductive modes (arrhenotoky, thelytoky and strict cyclical parthenogenesis), but the mechanism remains unknown. We have studied the reproductive system of a rose gallwasp, Diplolepis spinosissimae, which was found to exhibit two different reproductive systems according to the population. In eight out of the ten populations studied, all along the Atlantic coast, D. spinosissimae is thelytokous. Males are extremely rare, and all females are homozygous at three microsatellite loci. "Obligate homozygous parthenogenesis' was found to be strictly associated with the presence of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia sp. In the two remaining populations, deprived of Wolbachia, D. spinosissimae reproduced by arrhenotoky as indicated by the larger frequency of males and heterozygosity of females. Allelic diversity, although not zero, was highly reduced in the coastal populations, as a consequence of thelytoky and gamete duplication. We hypothesize that mating of uninfected males with infected females during the first generations after an infection event could explain the small but significant amount of polymorphism observed in those populations. The high level of differentiation indicates a low gene flow, even between geographically close coastal populations.

TI Manipulation of host behaviour by parasites: ecosystem engineering in
   the intertidal zone?
AB Understanding the influence of parasites on the community ecology of free-living organisms is an emerging theme in ecology. The cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi is an abundant mollusc inhabiting the sheltered shores of New Zealand. This species, which lives just a few centimetres under the surface, plays a key role for many benthic invertebrate species, because in these habitats the cockle shell is the only available hard surface where invertebrates can establish. However, the behaviour of this cockle can be altered locally by a parasite, the trematode Curtuteria australis. Indeed, heavily infected cockles are unable to bury perfectly and typically lie entirely exposed at the surface of the mud. In this study we investigated the ecological consequences of this behavioural alteration for two invertebrate species commonly associated with cockles, the anemone Anthopleura aureoradiata and the limpet Notoacmea helmsi. A field study first demonstrated that in both infected and non-infected populations of cockles, there was a negative relationship between the number of anemones and limpets found on cockles. In the laboratory, we showed that predation of limpets by anemones is possible when they share the same cockle shell. In a heavily infected population of cockles, limpets were significantly more frequent and more abundant on cockles manipulated by C. australis than on cockles with a normal behaviour. A colonization test conducted in natural conditions demonstrated that the predominance of limpets on manipulated cockles results from a direct habitat preference. Conversely anemones were significantly less frequent and less abundant on manipulated cockles than on cockles manipulated by C. australis. A desiccation test revealed that, relative to limpets, they had a lower resistance to this physical stress. We discuss our results in relation to current ideas on ecosystem engineering by organisms.

TI Dynamics of a feline retrovirus (FeLV) in host populations with variable
   spatial structure
AB The predictions of epidemic models are remarkably affected by the underlying assumptions concerning host population dynamics and the relation between host density and disease transmission. Furthermore, hypotheses underlying distinct models are rarely tested. Domestic cats (Felis catus) can be used to compare models and test their predictions, because cat populations show variable spatial structure that probably results in variability in the relation between density and disease transmission. Cat populations also exhibit various dynamics. We compare four epidemiological models of Feline Leukaemia Virus (FeLV). We use two different incidence terms, i.e. proportionate mixing and pseudo-mass action. Population dynamics are modelled as logistic or exponential growth. Compared with proportionate mixing, mass action incidence with logistic growth results in a threshold population size under which the virus cannot persist in the population. Exponential growth of host populations results in systems where FeLV persistence at a steady prevalence and depression of host population growth are biologically unlikely to occur. Predictions of our models account for presently available data on FeLV dynamics in various populations of cats. Thus, host population dynamics and spatial structure can be determinant parameters in parasite transmission, host population depression, and disease control.

Periods of mosquito infectivity were determined to establish a model system for the testing of transmission-blocking vaccines;The highest levels of mosquito infection were associated with the ascending asexual parasitemia after reaching 1,000/mu l, and before the peak asexual parasite count. Sporozoite-induced infections were more infectious than were trophozoite-induced infections. Secondary episodes of parasitemia were also infectious, indicating the lack of development of naturally developing transmission-blocking immunity to this strain of P. vivax in splenectomized Aotus monkeys following single infections.

TI Pathogenesis of a North American hantavirus, Black Creek Canal virus, in
   experimentally infected Sigmodon hispidus
AB This report describes the first detailed analysis of the replication, persistence, and excretion of a North American hantavirus in its natural rodent reservoir. Black Creek Canal virus was isolated from Sigmodon hispidus (cotton rat) shortly after the identification of a hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) case occurring in southern Florida. Six-week-old male cotton rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1,000 tissue culture infectious doses. Viral complementary RNA (vcRNA) was quantified as a means of determining the site(s) of viral activity (transcription and replication), in the first few weeks post inoculation (pi), vcRNA was detectable in every tissue examined except blood. The quantities of vcRNA decreased over time, and by five months pi it could be detected only in the brain. In addition to using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) as a means of measuring viral replication/ transcription, attempts were made to reisolate virus from all tissue samples taken. Virus could be isolated from every solid tissue examined, and the titers appeared to decrease over time, similar to the QPCR results. However, in contrast to the QPCR results, infectious virus was still routinely detectable at low levels in adrenal gland, liver, kidney, and testicle 150 days pi. Although results of testing for vcRNA in the blood were uniformly negative, infectious virus was detected at one week pi, reached highest titers at two weeks, and decreased dramatically by three weeks. After three weeks pi, infectious virus could only be detected sporadically in blood. Virus was isolated from urine collected during the first 70 days pi and throughout the entire study period in feces and wet bedding. These data indicate that the viral infection can be separated into an acute phase associated with high virus titers, and a chronic or persistent phase associated with lower virus titers and continued shedding of virus in excreta.

TI Maintenance of diversity within plant communities: Soil pathogens as
   agents of negative feedback
AB The effect of soil pathogens on plant communities was investigated using four old-field perennial plant species and five isolates of a pathogenic oomycete in the genus Pythium. These Pythium strains were isolated from the roots of two of the plant species, Danthonia spicata and Panicum sphaerocarpon, used in a previous experiment on the consequences of changes in the soil community on plant growth. In this previous experiment, Danthonia and Panicum changed the soil community in a manner that reduced their growth relative to that of a third plant species, Anthoxanthum odoratum. In the current experiments, we found that inoculation with Pythium reduced overall plant mass and root:shoot ratios, but Danthonia and Panicum were more susceptible to the presence of Pythium than the other two plant species, Anthoxanthum and Plantago lanceolata. In addition, Pythium accumulates at different rates on different plant species, with a greater than tenfold higher population observed in association with Panicum compared to Anthoxanthum. The results of these experiments suggest that the accumulation of species-specific soil pathogens could account for the previous observation of negative feedback on plant growth through changes in the soil community. As negative feedback may act to maintain plant species diversity within a community, these results suggest that soil pathogens may themselves contribute to the maintenance of plant species diversity.

TI The role of resources and pathogens in mediating the mating system of
   Kalmia latifolia
AB We examined the influence of the leaf spot pathogen Cercospora kalmiae on reproductive success in self-fertilized vs. outcrossed progeny in the mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia). To explore the interaction between disease incidence and mating system within natural populations of K. latifolia, we ascertained the correlation between disease intensity and two measures of plant reproductive success (proportional fruit set and seedling survival) and partitioned the correlation by pollination treatment (i.e., naturally pollinated, hand pollinated with outcrossed pollen, or self-pollinated). For outcrossed flowers, neither the number of fruits produced nor the performance of seedlings from these fruits was affected by the intensity of disease damage. However, for selfed flowers, both the number of fruits and the performance of seedlings were negatively correlated with disease damage on the maternal parent. Consequently, fungal infection on a maternal plant was associated with an increased proportion of outcrossed progeny produced by the host plant. Motivated by the observed correlation between disease and selfing, we performed a manipulative field experiment to examine the mechanism by which disease could influence the fitness consequences of different mating strategies. We hypothesized that intense C. kalmiae infection reduced K. latifolia resources by reducing photosynthetic leaf area and, consequently, enhanced abortion of self-fertilized fruits more than outcrossed fruits. We found that artificial leaf damage reduced outcrossed fruit set by 17% compared to controls. However, artificial leaf damage reduced selfed fruit set by 31% compared to controls. Similarly, artificial damage did not significantly affect infructescence abortion in outcrossed pollinations. However, for self-pollinated inflorescences, those subtended by damaged leaves experienced a 44% increase in infructescence abortion compared to controls. We conclude that resource limitation, here by leaf damage, can lower the production of self-fertilized seeds relative to outcrossed seeds, thus modifying a plant's mating system.

TI Cities and villages: infection hierarchies in a measles metapopulation
AB An important issue in the dynamics of directly transmitted microparasites is the relationship between infection probability and host density. We use models and extensive spatio-temporal data for the incidence of measles to examine evidence for spatial heterogeneity in transmission probability, in terms of urban-rural hierarchies in infection rate. Pre-vaccination measles data for England and Wales show strong evidence for urban-rural heterogeneities in infection rate - the proportion of urban cases rises significantly before major epidemics. The model shows that this effect is consistent with a higher infection rate in large cities, though small towns have epidemic characteristics intermediate between town and country. Surprisingly, urban and rural areas of the same population size have a similar propensity for local extinction of infection. A spatial map of urban-rural correlations reveals complex regional patterns of synchronization of towns and cities. The hierarchical heterogeneities in infection persist into the vaccine era; their implications for disease persistence and control are discussed.

In these syndromes, the failure of cultivation-dependent microbial detection methods reveals our ignorance of microbial growth requirements. Sequence-based molecular methods, however, offer alternative approaches for microbial identification directly from host specimens found in the setting of unexplained acute illnesses, chronic inflammatory disease, and from anatomic sites that contain commensal microflora. The rapid expansion of genome sequence databases and advances in biotechnology present opportunities and challenges: identification of consensus sequences from which reliable, specific phylogenetic information can be inferred for all taxonomic groups of pathogens, broad-range pathogen identification on the basis of virulence-associated gene families, and use of host gene expression response profiles as specific signatures of microbial infection.

TI Transmission of Plodia interpunctella granulosis virus does not conform
   to the mass action model
AB 1. Transmission of insect pathogens is traditionally described by a term which states that transmission is proportional to the densities of the susceptible hosts and the infectious units, multiplied by a constant, the transmission coefficient. Theoretical studies suggest chat deviations from this can be important in host-pathogen population dynamics, but little is known of how commonly pathogen transmission conforms to the conventional model.
   2. We describe a test of the traditional assumption for the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) (Hubner) and its granulosis virus using a modification of the previous methods, which allows for unpredictable declines in the amount of infectious material present.
   3. The estimated transmission coefficient increased with the density of susceptible hosts and showed a marked decline with density of infectious cadavers. This suggests that the usual assumption does not adequately describe transmission in this system.
   4. The reasons for this deviation from the usual assumption are likely to be a combination of behavioural and physiological changes at high host density, and differential susceptibility to the pathogen leading to an effect analogous to pseudo-interference in parasitoids.

TI Epidemiology of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and structure of domestic
   cat populations
AB The spatial structure of host populations mal affect parasite transmission and effect. Our interest focused on feline leukemia virus (FeLV), a lethal retrovirus affecting both domestic cats (Felis catus) and wildcats (Felis silvestris). We assessed presence and epidemiology of FeLV in a long-term study of 3 domestic cat populations in France. All 3 populations shared a common pattern based on matrilinear groups, but they differed in population size, cat density, connections among cat groups (i.e., human shelters) and connections with adjacent feline populations. The prevalence of FeLV was different among populations (P < 0.001). Other at-risk categories for FeLV infection included nonneutered cats (P = 0.010), cats living with a single conspecific in the same house (P = 0.20), and cats allowed to roam freely (P = 0.048). The best model for the prediction of FeLV prevalence included effects of population, reproductive status, and group size, but the effect of roaming habit was confounding. The virus did, not persist in 1 of the 3 populations, and we hypothesized that this extinction is linked to small population size and isolation. These conclusions raise new perspectives For management of endangered populations of wildcats. Although wildcat populations have been declining in size, keeping small populations isolated from each other and from domestic cats could help prevent the spread and persistence of FeLV infection.

TI Biodiversity of rhizobia isolated from a wide range of forest legumes in
   Brazil
AB Tropical forests have a high diversity of plant species; are they associated with a correspondingly rich microbial flora? We addressed this question by examining the symbiotic rhizobium bacteria that nodulate a diverse pool of forest legume species in Brazil. The 44 strains studied had been isolated from 29 legume tree species representing 13 tribes including all three subfamilies of the Leguminosae, and were chosen to represent major groups from a larger sample that had previously been characterized by SDS-PAGE of total proteins. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequence was determined, corresponding to positions 44-303 in the Escherichia coli sequence. Fifteen sequences were found, including six novel ones. However, all but one of them could be assigned to a genus because they grouped closely with sequences from previously described rhizobial species. Fast-growing strains had sequences similar to Rhizobium spp., Sinorhizobium spp. or Mesorhizobium spp., while the slow-growing strains had sequences similar to Bradyrhizobium spp. One strain with an intermediate growth rate had a unique sequence which indicated that the strain might belong to the genus Azorhizobium. Although the strains showed a variety of sequences, it was surprising that these strains isolated from taxonomically very diverse host plants in previously unexplored environments were mostly very similar to strains described previously, largely from agricultural systems.

TI Host densities as determinants of abundance in parasite communities
AB Several epidemiological models predict a positive relationship between host population density and abundance of directly transmitted macroparasites. Here, we generalize these, and test the prediction by a comparative study. We used data on communities of gastrointestinal strongylid nematodes from 19 mammalian species, representing examination of 6670 individual hosts. We studied both the average abundance of all strongylid nematodes within a host species, and the two components of abundance, prevalence and intensity. The effects of host body weight, diet, fecundity and age at maturity and parasite body size were controlled for directly, and the phylogenetically independent contrast method was used to control for confounding factors more generally. Host population density and average parasite abundance were strongly positively correlated within mammalian taxa, and across all species when the effects of host body weight were controlled for. Controlling for other variables did not change this. Even when looking at single parasite species occurring in several host species, abundance was highest in the host species with the highest population density. Prevalence and intensity showed similar patterns. These patterns provide the first macroecological evidence consistent with the prediction that transmission rates depend on host population density in natural parasite communities.

TI Using disability-adjusted life years to assess the economic impact of
   dengue in Puerto Rico: 1984-1994
AB This study presents the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a non-monetary economic measure of impact, lost to dengue in Puerto Rico for the period 1984-1994. Data on the number of reported cases, cases with hemorrhagic manifestations, hospitalizations, and deaths were obtained from a surveillance system maintained at the Dengue Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (San Juan, PR). The reported cases were divided into two age groups (0-15 years old and > 15 years old), and then multiplied by predetermined factors (10 for 0-15 years; 27 for > 15 years) to allow for age-related under-reporting of cases. Severity of dengue was modeled by classifying cases into three groups: dengue fever, dengue with severe manifestations, and hospitalized cases. Each group was assigned a different number of days lost because of dengue-related disability. Dengue caused an average of 658 DALYs per year per million population (SE = 114, range = 145-1,519). A multivariate sensitivity analysis, which simultaneously altered the values of six input variables, produced a mean of 580 DALYs/year/million population, with a maximum average of 1,021 DALYs/year/million population, and a maximum, single-year estimate for 1994 of 2,153 DALYs/million population. The most important input was the number of days lost to classic dengue. The DALYs/year/million population lost to dengue in Puerto Rico are much greater than previous estimates concerning the impact of dengue hemorrhagic fever alone. The loss to dengue is similar to the losses per million population in the Latin American and Caribbean region attributed to any of the following diseases or disease clusters; the childhood cluster (polio, measles, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus), meningitis, hepatitis, or malaria. The loss is also of the same order of magnitude as any one of the following: tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases (excluding human immunodeficiency virus), tropical cluster (e.g., Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis), or intestinal helminths. The results objectively suggest that when governments and international funding agencies allocate resources for research and control, dengue should be given a priority equal to many other infectious diseases that are generally considered more important.

TI Baseline immunity of the population and impact of insecticide-treated
   curtains on malaria infection
AB It has been shown that insecticide-treated bed nets or curtains may reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria in hyper-holoendemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. This protection could partially depend on the transitory imbalance between the anti-malaria immunity acquired by the population before the intervention and the lowered sporozoite load resulting from the anti-vector measure. To verify if the efficacy of the intervention is influenced by the baseline immune status of the population, we compared the protective effect of permethrin-impregnated curtains (PIC) against malaria infection among groups with different baseline levels of anti-malaria immunity, We analyzed the impact of PIC on the Plasmodium falciparum infection rate in two rural villages of Burkina Faso inhabited by three ethnic groups: the Fulani, Mossi, and Rimaibe. These have been previously shown to differ for several malariologic indices, with the Fulani being characterized by lower infection and disease rates and by higher immune response to P. falciparum with respect to the other ethnic groups. The PIC were distributed in June 1996 and their impact on malaria infection was evaluated in groups whose baseline levels of immunity to malaria differed because of their age and ethnic group. Age- and ethnic-dependent efficacy of the PIC was observed. Among the Mossi and Rimaibe, the impact (parasite rate reduction after PIC installation with respect to the pre-intervention surveys) was 18.8% and 18.5%, respectively. A more than two-fold general impact (42.8%) was recorded in the Fulani. The impact of the: intervention on infection rates appears positively correlated with the levels of anti-malaria immunity, Since decreased transmission entails a reduction of immunity, the efficacy of the intervention in the long term cannot be taken for granted. The expected complementary role of a hypothetical vaccine is stressed by these results, which also emphasize the importance of the genetic background of the population in the evaluation and application of malaria control strategies.

TI Trade-off between virulence and vertical transmission and the
   maintenance of a virulent plant pathogen
AB The continuum hypothesis predicts that parasites should evolve reduced virulence if they have higher opportunity for vertical transmission. However, when there is a trade-off between Virulence and vertical transmission, selection may favor horizontal transmission and higher virulence. Atkinsonella hypoxylon is a fungal pathogen that reduces Danthonia fitness by 50% or moro when it completely castrates hosts' chasmogamous inflorescences, despite the high opportunity for vertical transmission through cleistogamous seeds. Sporadically, infected hosts with partially castrated inflorescences (which have higher fecundity than completely castrated hosts) are observed in natural populations. Why are partially castrated plants rare if selection favors reduced virulence! We investigated whether there was genetic diversity for virulence among A. hypoxylon genotypes and the relationship between virulence and vertical transmission. We found that the fungal genotype significantly affects the occurrence of partial castration in Danthonia compressa. The proportion of seedlings that were vertically infected by their maternal plant was lower for partially castrated than for completely castrated plants. Our results demonstrate a trade-off between virulence and vertical transmission, explaining the maintenance of more virulent, completely castrating Fungal genotypes in natural populations, and suggest that vertical transmission in plants is more complex than what is considered in current models.

   and Wales, 1990-5
AB Data from the national surveillance scheme for general outbreaks of intestinal disease, and the national laboratory reporting scheme were used to describe the epidemiology of small round structured virus (SRSV) infections in England and Wales. Between 1990 and 1995, there were 7492 laboratory reports of SRSV. Rates of reported illness were highest among infants, young children and the elderly. During 1992-5, some 707 SRSV outbreaks were reported. Outbreaks in hospital wards and residential facilities for the elderly accounted for 76 % of the total, and annual numbers increased more than sixfold over the study period. There were wide regional variations in the numbers of SRSV outbreaks and laboratory reports. Both sporadic cases and outbreaks in the community are likely to be underestimated, but these passive surveillance systems provide an insight into the burden of SRSV infection among the institutionalized elderly.

TI HBV and HCV infection among non-European Union immigrants in North-East
   Italy
AB The status of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among non-European Union (non-EU) immigrants in North-East Italy was evaluated. Among the 1683 individuals tested the prevalence of HBsAg was 8.9 % (150 subjects) and of HBV antibodies (anti-HBc with/without anti-HBs) was 38.9 % (654 subjects). The distribution of HBV serological markers showed significant differences according to region of origin; the highest prevalence of infection (76.9 %) and carriage (16.1 %) was found in immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Among the 933 individuals screened for HCV infection, prevalence of antibody was much lower (0.9 %) than that observed in the Italian general population (3.2-12.6 %). The large number of HBV carriers among immigrants could increase the number of new adult infections due to life-style habits or professional risks in the host population. In contrast, the risk of HCV spread from non-EU immigrants is very low.

TI At-risk individuals in Feline Immunodeficiency Virus epidemiology:
   Evidence from a multivariate approach in a natural population of
   domestic cats (Felis catus)
AB Prevalence of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) infection was measured during 6 consecutive years in a natural rural population of domestic cats. Sex, age, weight, origin, group size and presence of antibodies to FIV were recorded for each sampled cat. Logistic regressions were used to estimate the influence of the recorded parameters on infection. FIV prevalence rates are as high as 19.6% in the total population, and do not statistically change between years, after controlling for changes in samples' age structure. FIV infection is characterized by risk factors linked to aggressive behaviour: old mature male adults having dispersed are more likely to be infected. A study of the cats group size and of the spatial distribution of infected individuals indicates the absence of infection clusters in males, and suggests the importance of roaming in the spreading of FIV. In conclusion, FIV infection spreads, with low contagiousness, mainly between particularly aggressive individuals, and the virus is endemic in this population.

TI Host-parasite coevolution: Evidence for rare advantage and time-lagged
   selection in a natural population
AB In theory, parasites can create time-lagged, frequency-dependent selection in their hosts, resulting in oscillatory gene-frequency dynamics in both the host and the parasite (the Red Queen hypothesis). However, oscillatory dynamics have not been observed in natural populations. In the present study, we evaluated the dynamics of asexual clones of a New Zealand snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, and its trematode parasites over a five-year period. During the summer of each year, we determined host-clone frequencies in random samples of the snail to track genetic changes in the snail population. Similarly, we monitored changes in the parasite population, focusing on the dominant parasite, Microphallus sp., by calculating the frequency of clones in samples of infected individuals from the same collections. We then compared these results to the results of a computer model that was designed to examine clone frequency dynamics for various levels of parasite virulence. Consistent with these simulations and with ideas regarding dynamic coevolution, parasites responded to common clones in a time-lagged fashion. Finally, in a laboratory experiment, we found that crones that had been rare during the previous five years were significantly less infectible by Microphallus when compared to the common clones. Taken together, these results confirm that rare host genotypes are more likely to escape infection by parasites; they also show that host-parasite interactions produce, in a natural population, some of the dynamics anticipated by the Red Queen hypothesis.

TI Geographic structure of lineage associations in a plant-bacterial
   mutualism
AB Two species linked by a mutualistic relationship may evolve correlated population differentiation if there is long-term continuity of interactions between specific partners. This phenomenon was analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis on the annual legume Amphicarpaea bracteata and its nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbionts (Bradyrhizobium sp.) sampled from >20 sites over a 1000 km area. Three analyses indicated that genetic differentiation was correlated in the two organisms. First, the genetic distance between bacterial populations at each pair of sites was significantly positively related to the genetic distance between their host plant populations, as evaluated by the Mantel test. Second, a cluster analysis revealed that several divergent lineages were present both among plants and among bacteria. Bacterial lineages showed a highly nonrandom distribution across plant lineages that was consistent in each of two regions sampled. Finally, there were numerous cases where populations of the same plant lineage 1000 km apart harbored bacterial isolates with an identical multilocus genotype. Thus, despite recurrent opportunities for partner switching, particular genotypes of these two organisms associate consistently across multiple habitats throughout their geographic range.

Comparison of the chewing louse distributions to the distribution of mtDNA haplotypes for the gophers revealed no significant concordance, and thus falsifies the maternal transmission hypothesis.

TI Widespread occurrence of the micro-organism Wolbachia in ants
AB For more than 20 years, sex allocation in hymenopteran societies has been a major topic in insect sociobiology. A recurring idea was that relatedness asymmetries arising from their haplodiploid sex determination system would lead to various parent-offspring conflicts over optimal reproduction. A possible weakness of existing theory is that only interests of nuclear genes are properly accounted for. Yet, a diversity of maternally transmitted elements manipulate the reproduction of their host in many solitary arthropod groups. The bacterium Wolbachia is a striking example of such a selfish cytoplasmic element, with effects ranging from reproductive incompatibility between host strains, induction of parthenogenesis and feminization of males. This paper reports on a first PCR-based Wolbachia screening in ants. Out of 50 Indo-Australian species, 50% screened positive for an A-group strain. One of these species also harboured a B-group strain in a double infection. Various factors that might explain the unusually high incidence of Wolbachia in ants are discussed. In general, Wolbachia may represent a widespread and previously unrecognized party active in the conflicts of interest within social insect colonies.

TI The curse of the pharaoh hypothesis
AB The 'curse of the pharaoh' has been used as a metaphor for the hypothesis that higher parasite propagule survival selects for higher virulence. Indeed, the mysterious death of Lord Carnavon after entering the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen could potentially be explained by an infection with a highly virulent and very long-lived pathogen. In this paper, I investigate whether parasite virulence increases with high propagule survival. In this respect, I derive an analytic expression of the evolutionarily stable level of parasite virulence as a function of propagule survival rate when the host-parasite system has reached a stable ecological equilibrium. This result shows that, if multiple infection occurs, higher propagule survival generally increases parasite virulence. This effect is enhanced when parasite dispersal coevolves with parasite virulence. In a more general perspective, the model shows the importance of taking into account the combination of direct and indirect effects (which I call inclusive effects) of higher transmission ability on the evolution of parasite virulence. The recognition of these effects has several practical implications for virulence management.

   parasitoid attack in Drosophila melanogaster
AB Costs of resistance are widely assumed to be important in the evolution of parasite and pathogen defence in animals, but they have been demonstrated experimentally on very few occasions. Endoparasitoids are insects whose larvae develop inside the bodies of other insects where they defend themselves from attack by their hosts' immune systems (especially cellular encapsulation). Working with Drosophila melanogaster and its endoparasitoid Leptopilina boulardi, we selected for increased resistance in four replicate populations of flies. The percentage of flies surviving attack increased from about 0.5% to between 40% and 50% in five generations, revealing substantial additive genetic variation in resistance in the field population from which our culture was established. In comparison with four control lines, flies from selected lines suffered from lower larval survival under conditions of moderate to severe intraspecific competition.

AB Street-vended foods and beverages, an integral part of urban economies in the developing world, have been implicated in cholera transmission in Latin America. To improve the microbiologic quality of market-vended beverages in Guatemala, we tested a simple system consisting of dilute bleach (4.95% free available chlorine) for water purification, narrow-mouth plastic vessels with spigots for disinfecting and storing water and for preparing and storing beverages, handwashing soap, and education in using the system. We conducted a randomized controlled intervention trial among 41 vendors who received the intervention and 42 control vendors, comparing total and fecal coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli contamination of market-vended beverages, stored water, and vendors' hands. Samples were obtained at baseline and at each of six weekly follow-up visits. At baseline, fecal coliform bacteria were found in 40 (48%) market-vended beverages and E. coli in 14 (17%). When compared with samples from control vendors, a significant decrease in total coliform (P < 0.001) and fecal coliform (P < 0.001) bacteria in samples of stored water and beverages sold by intervention vendors was observed over the course of the study. The vessel system was well accepted by vendors. This simple inexpensive system consisting of hypochlorite disinfectant, plastic vessels, soap, and education can significantly reduce fecal contamination of market-vended beverages.

In vitro, both exponential phase and stationary phase amastigotes were capable of transforming and growing as promastigotes, but exponential phase amastigotes completed this transition more quickly. in vivo, both populations were capable of establishing infections in sand flies by membrane feeding and could be transmitted to BALB/c mice via bite. A variety of morphologic forms could be observed in vivo, including putative metacyclic promastigotes. Infection rates in sandflies with axenic amastigotes were comparable with those achieved with lesion-derived amastigotes, supporting the use of these cultured forms in studies of parasite biology.

In both populations seroprevalence increased with age, with the most striking increase occurring at 18 years of age in the Paraguayan population and at 35 years of age in the Salta population, The peak prevalences in both populations (66.6% and 44.0%, respectively) were seen in Indians > 53 years old. Although no sex difference was observed in the Paraguayan Indians, in the Salta population seroprevalence was greater in males than in females. Familiar clustering of the infection was observed. The data indicate that the Indian populations of the Gran Chaco are frequently exposed to and survive infection with a Sin Nombre-like virus(es). Possible explanations of this novel epidemiology are discussed.

   fundamental assumptions
AB The idea that the rate of production of new infections, of directly transmitted microparasites, is a reflection of an interaction between the number of infectious hosts and the number of susceptible hosts in a population is central to our understanding of dynamical processes in epidemiology. Empirical support for the idea has been seriously lacking, especially for endemic infections in natural hosts, but is provided here for cowpox virus infection in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), using alternative descriptions of transmission dynamics: true and pseudo mass action. The former appears, overall, to give a better description of the dynamics. Transmission rates differ in two natural populations, but both support previously untested theories on the allometric scaling of transmission rates.

TI Large-scale patterns of host use by parasites of freshwater fishes
AB Organisms that are abundant locally in a habitat patch are commonly observed to be frequent regionally, or among patches. In parasites, species present in high numbers in host individuals are also present in many individuals in the host population. On a larger scale, however, when host species are considered as patches, we may expect the opposite pattern because of the cost of producing mechanisms to evade the immune responses of several host species. Thus parasite species exploiting many host species may achieve lower average abundance in their hosts than parasite species exploiting fewer host species. This prediction was tested with data from 188 species of metazoan parasites of freshwater fish, using a comparative approach that controlled for study effort and phylogenetic influences. A negative correlation was found between the number of host species used by parasites and their average abundance in hosts, measured as either prevalence or intensity of infection. There was no evidence that parasite species fall into distinct categories based on abundance patterns, but rather that they fall along a continuum ranging from a generally low abundance in many host species, to a generally high abundance in few host species. These results applied to both ecto- and endoparasites. The pattern observed suggests the existence of a trade-off between how many host species a parasite can exploit and how well it does on average in those hosts.

   parasite infection in the common lizard Lacerta vivipara
AB Parasites affect the life-histories and fitness of their hosts. It has been demonstrated that the ability of the immune system to cope with parasites partly depends on environmental conditions. In particular, stressful conditions have an immunosuppressive effect and may affect disease resistance. The relationship between environmental stress and parasitism was investigated using a blood parasite of the common lizard Lacerta vivipara. In laboratory cages, density and additional stressors had a significant effect on the intensity of both natural parasitaemia and parasitaemia induced by experimental infection. Four weeks after infection, crowded lizards had three times more parasites than noncrowded lizards. After 1 month of stress treatment, naturally infected lizards had a significantly higher level of plasma corticosterone and a higher parasite load than nonstressed individuals. In seminatural enclosures, stress induced by the habitat quality affected both the natural blood parasite prevalence and the intensity of parasitaemia of the host.

TI Mortality during dispersal and the cost of host-specificity in
   parasites: how many aphids find hosts?
AB 1. For a full assessment of explanations for the evolution of host-specificity it is necessary to estimate the probability that a dispersing parasite finds a host. We develop a method of estimating this success rate from samples of dispersing parasites and populations resident on hosts.
   2. Applying this method to data on the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), from southern Scotland in 1984-92, we estimate that 0.6% of the autumn migrants find hosts.
   3. With such a low success rate, there should be selection for a broadening of host range, to include any host on which the colonist's fitness is more than about 0.6% of that on the normal hosts. We argue that neither nutrition nor the need for 'enemy-free space' are sufficient explanations of the host-specificity of this animal, and propose instead that it is the host's role as a rendezvous for mating that constrains the migrants to their costly host-specificity.
   4. We also discuss the implications of this low success rate for the hypothesis that aphids speciate sympatrically through the formation of host races.

AB Neonatal sepsis is most often caused by group B streptococci (GBS) and is a major cause of death in the neonatal period. The response of the immune system in the newborn child has received much attention and is thought to be deficient in a number of ways. The effector response of neonatal monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) was investigated. Interferon-gamma induced the activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in MDM and inhibited the growth of GBS. Both effects were enhanced by the addition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha to the culture conditions. The coincident supplementation of L-tryptophan with the bacteria abrogated the bacterial growth inhibition, thus confirming the causative role of L-tryptophan depletion. Control of the extracellular as well as intracellular L-tryptophan levels may thus be one of the effector mechanisms with which the immune system defends the host against GBS dissemination and disease.

TI Evolutionary dynamics of rhizopine within spatially structured rhizobium
   populations
AB Symbiosis between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria is thought to bring mutual benefit to each participant. However, it is not known how rhizobia benefit from nodulating legume hosts because they fix nitrogen only after becoming bacteroids, which are terminally differentiated cells that cannot reproduce. Because undifferentiated rhizobia in and around the nodule can reproduce, evolution of symbiotic nitrogen fixation may depend upon kin selection. In some hosts, these kin may persist in the nodule as viable, undifferentiated bacteria. In other hosts, no viable rhizobia survive to reproduce after nodule senescence. Bacteroids in these hosts may benefit their free-living kin by enhancing production of plant root exudates. However, unrelated non-mutualists may also benefit from increased plant exudates. Rhizopines, compounds produced by bacteroids in nodules and catabolized only by related free-living rhizobia, may provide a mechanism by which bacteroids can preferentially benefit kin. Despite this apparent advantage, rhizopine genotypes are relatively rare. We constructed a mathematical model to examine how mixing within rhizobium populations influences the evolution of rhizopine genotypes. Our model predicts that the success of rhizopine genotypes is strongly dependent upon the spatial genetic structure of the bacterial population; rhizopine is more likely to dominate well-mixed populations. Further, for a given level of mixing, we find that rhizopine evolves under a positive frequency-dependent process in which stochastic accumulation of rhizopine alleles is necessary for rhizopine establishment. This process leads to increased spatial structure in rhizobium populations, and suggests that rhizopine may expand the conditions under which nitrogen fixation can evolve via kin selection.

   Epidemiologic investigations
AB Outbreaks of yellow fever (YF) have never been recorded in Kenya. However, in September 1992, cases of hemorrhagic fever (HF) were reported in the Kerio Valley to the Kenya Ministry of Health. Early in 1993, the disease was confirmed as YF and a mass vaccination campaign was initiated. Cases of suspected YF were identified through medical record review and hospital-based disease surveillance by using a clinical case definition. Case-patients were confirmed serologically and virologically. We documented 55 persons with HF from three districts of the Rift Valley Province in the period of September 10, 1992 through March 11, 1993 (attack rate = 27.4/100,000 population). Twenty-six (47%) of the 55 persons had serologic evidence of recent YF infection, and three of these persons were also confirmed by YF virus isolation. No serum was available from the other 29 HF cases. In addition, YF virus was isolated from a person from the epidemic area who had a nonspecific febrile illness but did not meet the case definition. Five patients with confirmed cases of YF died, a case-fatality rate of 19%. Women with confirmed cases of YF were 10.9 times more likely to die than men (P = 0.010, by Fisher's exact test). Of the 26 patients with serologic or virologic evidence of YF, and for whom definite age was known, 21 (81%) were between 10 and 39 years of age, and 19 (73%) were males. All patients with confirmed YF infection lived in rural areas. There was only one instance of multiple cases within a single family, and this was associated with bush-clearing activity. This was the first documented outbreak of YF in Kenya, a classic example of a sylvatic transmission cycle. Surveillance in rural and urban areas outside the vaccination area should be intensified.

TI Antagonistic coevolution over productivity gradients
AB This Study addresses the question of how spatial heterogeneity in prey productivity and migration act to determine geographic patterns in antagonistic coevolution with a predator. We develop and analyze a quantitative coevolutionary model for a predator-prey interaction. If the model is modified appropriately, the results could broadly apply to multispecies communities and to herbivore-plant, parasite-host, and parasitoid-host associations. Model populations are distributed over a gradient in prey birth rate (as a measure of productivity). Each population, in each patch, is made up of a suite of strains. Each strain of the predator has a certain ability to successfully attack each strain of the prey. We consider scenarios of isolated patches, global migration, and stepping-stone (i.e., local) migration over a linear string of patches. The most pervasive patterns are the following: investments in predator offense and prey defense are both maximal in the patches of highest prey productivity; when there are no constraints on maximal investment, mean predation evolves to highest levels in the most productive patches; similarly, the predator has a greater impact (measured as the percentage reduction in prey density) on the prey population in high productivity patches as compared with low productivity ones-in spite (even after evolution) of prey abundance being highest in the most productive patches; and migration has the net effect of shunting relatively offensive and defensive strains from productive patches to nonproductive ones, potentially resulting in the elimination of otherwise rare, low-investment clones. A modification of the model to gene-for-gene type interactions predicts that generalist strains (in terms of the range of strains the predator can exploit or the prey can fend off) dominate in productive areas of the prey, whereas specialists prevail in marginal habitats. Assuming a wide range of productivities over the prey's geographical distribution, the greatest strain diversity should be found in habitats of intermediate productivity. We discuss the implications of our study for adaptation and conservation. Empirical studies are in broad accord with our findings.

TI Red queen meets Santa Rosalia: Arms races and the evolution of host
   specialization in organisms with parasitic lifestyles
AB I argue that nonequilibrium allele frequency dynamics due to coevolution can drive the evolution of specialized host races in parasites capable of host choice-for example, herbivorous insects or parasitoids. The proposed mechanism does not require genetic trade-offs in performance on different host species. It is based on the premise that the ability of the parasite to overcome the resistance of different host species is to a large degree genetically independent-that is, controlled by different loci. The intuitive rationale is that the genetic lineage of a parasite that evolves host preference becomes more consistently exposed to selection for performance on its preferred host. Such a choosy lineage can thus coevolve faster in response to evolving host defenses than a generalist lineage distributed among several host species. Given genetic variation in host preference, an initially generalist parasite population evolves toward specialized host races, each choosing one host species. This idea is supported by a series of multilocus models of coevolution between a parasite and two host species, in which the parasite virulence on each host is affected by a different set of loci and an additional locus or two loci control host choice.

TI Long-term effects of defoliation on red pine suitability to insects
   feeding on diverse plant tissues
AB Evidence that defoliation can induce long-term responses in perennial plants that can regulate insect population dynamics is based largely on studies using deciduous and folivores, particularly Lepidoptera. Studies with evergreen trees, and with insects feeding on other plant parts, have yielded more variable results. This study examined the effects over several seasons of controlled defoliation on the suitability of an evergreen conifer, red pine (Pinus resinosa) to insects and pathogens that exploit foliage, stem phloem, and root tissue. Test insects included a folivorous sawfly (Hymenoptera) and two species of stem- and root-colonizing beetles (Coleoptera). Each of these species undergoes periodic population irruptions.
   Controlled defoliations were administered to 10-yr-old trees at levels that mimic naturally occurring sawfly outbreaks. Additional studies were conducted on seedlings in a glasshouse. Foliar suitability to the redheaded pine sawfly (Neodiprion lecontei) varied in a nonlinear fashion with defoliation intensity one year after treatment.
   However, not all parameters of sawfly success were equally affected. Female cocoon mass was related to foliar concentrations of nutrients, but not monoterpenes or diterpene acids. Suitability to the stem boring pine engraver (Ips pini) increased 2 yr after defoliation. Moderate defoliation reduced stem resin flow rate by 50% and increased stem phloem colonization rate by the beetle's mutualistic fungus, Ophiostoma ips. Defoliation also affected host suitability to adult pales weevils, Hylobius pales. Weevil feeding increased 1 yr after defoliation, but this response dissipated 2 yr after treatment.
   The observation that intermediate defoliation stress can either decrease or increase foliar suitability in an evergreen conifer, depending on intensity, is consistent with elements of both the plant stress and carbon:nutrient balance hypotheses. Moreover, host responses to a single stress agent may significantly and differentially influence the population dynamics of insects and pathogens that exploit different plant tissues. Implications of these results for plant stress and carbon : nutrient theories, plant-herbivore interactions, and chronic forest declines are discussed.

TI Quasispecies structure and persistence of RNA viruses
AB Viral quasispecies are closely related (but nonidentical) mutant and recombinant viral genomes subjected to continuous genetic variation, competition, and selection. Quasispecies structure and dynamics of replicating RNA enable virus populations to persist in their hosts and cause disease. We review mechanisms of viral persistence in cells, organisms, and populations of organisms and suggest that the critical interplay between host and viral influences (including in some cases the quasispecies organization) is the main driving force for long-term survival of viruses in nature.

TI The long-term dynamics of tuberculosis and other diseases with long
   serial intervals: implications of and for changing reproduction numbers
AB The net and basic reproduction numbers are among the most widely-applied concepts in infectious disease epidemiology. A net reproduction number (the average number of secondary infectious cases resulting from each case in a given population) of above 1 is conventionally associated with an increase in incidence; the basic reproduction number (defined analogously for a 'totally susceptible' population) provides a standard measure of the 'transmission potential' of an infection. Using a model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in England and Wales since 1900, we demonstrate that these measures are difficult to apply if disease can follow reinfection, and that they lose their conventional interpretations if important epidemiological parameters, such as the rate of contact between individuals, change over the time interval between successive cases in a chain of transmission (the serial interval).
   The net reproduction number for tuberculosis in England and Wales appears to have been approximately 1 from 1900 until 1950, despite concurrent declines in morbidity and mortality rates, and it declined rapidly in the second half of this century. The basic reproduction number declined from about 3 in 1900, reached 2 by 1950, and first fell below 1 in about 1960. Reductions in effective contact between individuals over this period, measured in terms of the average number of individuals to whom each case could transmit the infection, meant that the conventional basic reproduction number measure (which does not consider subsequent changes in epidemiological parameters) for a given year failed to reflect the 'actual transmission potential' of the infection. This latter property is better described by a variant of the conventional measure which takes secular trends in contact into account. These results are relevant for the interpretation of trends in any infectious disease for which epidemiological parameters change over time periods comparable to the infectious period, incubation period or serial interval.

TI Survey on viral pathogens in wild red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Germany
   with emphasis on parvoviruses and analysis of a DNA sequence from a red
   fox parvovirus
AB The seroprevalence of canine parvovirus (CPV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus (CAV) and canine herpesvirus (CHV) infections in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) was determined in fox sera collected between 1991 and 1995. A total of 500 sera were selected and the seroprevalences were estimated to be 13% (65 of 500 sera) for CPV, 4.4% (17 of 383 sera) for CDV, 3.5% (17 of 485 sera) for CAV, and 0.4% (2 of 485 sera) for CHV, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two (rural and suburban) areas under study.
   Parvovirus DNA sequences were amplified from tissues of free-ranging foxes and compared to those of prototype viruses from dogs and cats. We report here a parvovirus sequence indicative of a true intermediate between the feline panleukopenia virus-like viruses and the canine parvovirus-like viruses. The red fox parvoviral sequence, therefore, appears to represent a link between those viral groups. The DNA sequence together with a significant seroprevalence of parvovirus infections in foxes supports the hypothesis that the sudden emergence of canine parvovirus in the domestic dog population may have involved the interspecies transmission between wild and domestic carnivores.

TI Modelling the incidence of virus yellows in sugar beet in the UK in
   relation to numbers of migrating Myzus persicae
AB 1, The incidence of virus yellows diseases in sugar beet crops in eastern England during 1965-96 was analysed in relation to numbers of migrating Myzus persicae, the principal vector.
   2, A non-linear model was fitted to the data incorporating dual routes of infection: primary infection. arising from winged immigrant aphids carrying the virus, and secondary infection, arising from local dispersion of their wingless offspring transferring the virus from infected to uninfected plants.
   3. The model was fitted to the data assuming that (i) the epidemic commenced when the first migrating aphid was recorded, (ii) the rate of primary infection was dependent on the total number of aphids migrating up to the end of June, and (iii) the rate of secondary infection was dependent on the proportion of diseased plants in the crop.
   4, A good description of virus yellows incidence in August depended on allowing the rate parameters for primary and secondary infection to decrease sigmoidally over the years during 1965-96. The shape of this function depicted a major change in the epidemiology of virus yellows since 1974-76. Amongst several contributory factors, this change coincided with the introduction and subsequent wide use of systemic granular pesticides.
   5, Good fits also depended on allowing the rates of disease progress to decay with time to accommodate effects of increasing host resistance with plant age to feeding aphids. This meant that early epidemics rose faster than late epidemics, which is consistent with general observations.
   6, Given that the changes in the epidemiology of virus yellows over the years are associated with improvements in pest management practices, the model presents a useful extension to disease forecasting by providing predictions of disease risk in the absence of pesticides. Such predictions indicate that during the last decade up to five severe epidemics would have been likely.

AB In 1994, an apparent outbreak of atypical genital ulcers was noted by clinicians at the sexually transmitted disease clinic in Jackson, Mississippi. Of 143 patients with ulcers tested with a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, 56 (39%) were positive for Haemophilus ducreyi, 44 (31%) for herpes simplex virus, and 27 (19%) for Treponema pallidum; 12 (8%) were positive for >1 organism. Of 136 patients tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by serology, 14 (10%) a ere HIV-seropositive, compared with none of 200 patients without ulcers (P < .001), HIV-1 DNA was detected by PCR in ulcers of 6 (50%) of 12 HIV-positive patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that men with chancroid were significantly more likely than male patients without ulcers to report sex viith a crack cocaine user, exchange of money or drugs for sex, and multiple sex partners, The strong association between genital ulcers and HIV infection in this population highlights the urgency of preventing genital ulcers in the southern United States.

TI Polymorphic growth in larvae of the butterfly Maculinea rebeli, a social
   parasite of Myrmica ant colonies
AB Caterpillars of Maculinea rebeli have two growth strategies for living underground as social parasites of Myrmica ant colonies. Laboratory experiments and field data show that 25% of caterpillars live ten months with ants before pupating, whereas 75% grow slowly, parasitizing their hosts for 22 months. Both types of caterpillar form apparently identical similar-sized pupae. This may be the first description in the animal kingdom of polymorphic growth rates spanning different years within the same population, yet without resulting (as in salmonid fish) in two morphologically distinct adult types with obvious differences in behaviour. We suggest that a balanced polymorphism has evolved in M. rebeli growth rates, representing the most efficient way of exploiting the limited, yet steady, daily supply of food available to cuckoo-feeding parasites of long-lived ant societies. Bet-hedging benefits would also accrue to adult butterflies producing a mixture of annual and biennial offspring. Despite ergonomic and other benefits, partial biennialism is unlikely to evolve unless slow-growing individuals have enhanced survival and can remain attached to their mobile hosts. We show that caterpillars become so closely protected by, and integrated with, their host colonies that slow growers experience no greater mortality over two years than fast growers over one, and are transported in preference to the ants' own larvae when the host colony moves nest site.

TI Parallel effects of a B chromosome and a mite that decrease female
   fitness in the grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans
AB The effects of a genomic parasite (a B chromosome) and an ectoparasite (a mite) on the fitness of the host (the grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans) have been analysed in 60 experimental females. These two parasites differ in their infectious transmission mode. B chromosomes are vertically transmitted from host-parents to offspring, but mites are horizontally transmitted from one grasshopper to another within the same generation. The transmission mode can influence the virulence of these parasites, so that it should be expected that B chromosomes would be less virulent than mites. However, as mite transmission is linked to host mobility, some attenuation is also expected. Four egg pods were analysed from each female, the first two egg pods were laid after a mating and the remaining two were not preceded by a mating. The results show that B chromosomes severely decrease the proportion of eggs containing an embryo (egg fertility), mainly from the second egg pod onwards. Mites also decrease egg fertility but, in addition, they produced a decrease in the rate of embryo production over time (embryo productivity), which might be derived from both the fertility decrease and a slight delay in egg production. The analysis of the relative effect of both parasites suggests that they have a synergistic effect on embryo clutch size and egg fertility. Possible mechanisms for the observed effects are discussed.

TI Microparasite population dynamics and continuous immunity
AB A mathematical model is presented for the transmission of a microparasite where the hosts occupy one of two states, uninfected or infected. In each state, the hosts are distributed over a continuous range of immunity. The immune levels vary within hosts due to the processes of waning of immunity (when uninfected), and increasing immunity (when infected), eventually resulting in recovery. Immunity level also influences the host's ability to infect or be infected. Thus the proposed model incorporates both inter- and intra-host dynamics. It is shown from equilibrium results that this model is a general form of the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) family of models, a development that is useful for exploring multistrain pathogen transmission and use of vaccines which confer temporary protection.

TI Cache Valley and Potosi viruses (Bunyaviridae) in white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus): Experimental infections and antibody
   prevalence in natural populations
AB Cache Valley virus (CVV) and Potosi virus (POTV) are two closely related mosquito-borne viruses (Bunyaviridae: Bunyamwera group) that appear to circulate in several regions of the United States, especially the Midwest. We determined the prevalence of specific neutralizing antibodies to both viruses in Indiana white-tailed deer and conducted infection experiments to assess whether deer could serve as an vertebrate-amplifying host. Cross-infection experiments also were carried out to investigate the level of antibody cross-reactivity and cross-protection between the two viruses. The seroprevalence rate was high for both CVV (> 66%) and POTV (> 43%) in adult deer statewide. Antibodies neutralizing CVV were more common among deer harvested in the northern part of Indiana whereas the prevalence of POTV antibodies suggested a more southern distribution for this virus. Experimental infections of captive deer showed that they may serve as amplifying hosts for either virus. Deer infected with CVV or POTV developed a 1-3-day viremia with 3.0 and 4.1 log(10) plaque-forming units/ml mean peak titers, respectively. However, significant levels of antibody cross-reactivity between the two viruses were observed. Viremia was lower and shorter when animals immune to either CVV or POTV were cross-infected with the alternate virus and antibody responses following cross-infections resembled original antigenic sin with higher titers of antibodies against the primary agent.

TI No influence of age on infection complexity and allelic distribution in
   Plasmodium falciparum infections in Ndiop, a Senegalese village with
   seasonal, mesoendemic malaria
AB We have shown previously that in Dielmo, a Senegalese village with intense perennial Plasmodium falciparum transmission, the infection complexity and the distribution of some allelic types harbored by asymptomatic carriers was age-dependent. We report here an investigation of these parameters in Ndiop, a village located 5 km from Dielmo, where malaria is mesoendemic and seasonal, and where immunity is acquired at a very low rate, as indicated by the lifelong distribution of P. falciparum clinical attacks. Blood was collected from 143 and 125 inhabitants, including 122 individuals sampled in both surveys, during two cross-sectional surveys at one-month intervals during the 1994 transmission season. Plasmodium falciparum parasites were genotyped for three polymorphic single copy genes. Genetic diversity was very large, with 17, 43, and nine distinct alleles detected for the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), MSP-2, and glutamate-rich protein loci, respectively. These figures, similar to those previously observed in Dielmo, indicate that the parasite genetic diversity is not directly related to the inoculation rate, at least in the range of transmission intensity studied here. The complexity of the asymptomatic infections (average number of distinct genotypes per isolate) was more than two-fold lower in Ndiop than in Dielmo and importantly, did not decrease with age. Likewise, the allele distribution was not influenced by age, contrasting with the observations made in Dielmo. This indicates that the number of parasite types per isolate and the influence of age on complexity and allele distribution depend on the level of endemicity, consistent with the interpretation that they reflect acquired antiparasite immunity.

   immunodeficiency virus type 1 in the genital tract
AB Previously, a mucosal model of immunization against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was established by using influenza virus as a vector for the neutralizing gp41 epitope ELDKWA. Whether replication of this chimeric influenza virus in the upper respiratory tract of mice is sufficient for inducing mucosal immune responses in the genital tract was investigated. An immunization strategy was established that permits the virus to replicate in the murine upper respiratory tracts but not in the lungs. Intranasal application of the chimeric virus induced HIV-1-specific antibodies in sera and genital tract. In addition, chimeric virus-specific antibody-secreting cells were detected in lymphocyte populations obtained from lungs, spleens, and urogenital tracts. These results indicate that replication of the chimeric influenza/ELDKWA virus in the upper respiratory tract is sufficient to induce systemic immune responses as well as local immune responses in the genital tract.

TI Adult susceptibility to varicella in the tropics is a rural phenomenon
   due to the lack of previous exposure
AB In the industrialized countries of the West, varicella is largely a childhood disease, whereas reports from tropical countries indicate a significant incidence of varicella among adults. High ambient temperature, epidemiologic interference from other viruses, and race have been blamed. We tested our hypothesis that less exposure to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) during childhood in rural areas accounts for the reported greater frequency of varicella in adults in tropical climates by comparing rates of VZV seropositivity among urban and rural adult Bengalee populations living in identical climatic conditions in India. Only 5 (3.4%) of 153 urban adults were seronegative compared with 74 (31.1%) of 246 rural adults. Ninety-six percent of urban adults were immune by the age of 25, compared with 42% in the rural group. The results suggest that higher adult susceptibility to varicella is seen only in rural areas of the Tropics and is due to reduced transmission of VZV.

   (Sulzer), in Scotland, UK and evidence for the existence of a
   predominant clone
AB Clones of the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), mostly from Scotland, UK were examined using an rDNA fingerprinting technique. Eighty patterns (genotypes) were found amongst the 276 clones. A large number of clones (30%) from all sample areas in Scotland exhibited the same simple pattern, suggesting the presence of a single M. persicae clone. There was no difference in genotype distributions between M. persicae collected from brassica or potato crops, suggesting that host-adapted genotypes have no advantage in the field. Different fingerprints were randomly distributed in the environment, although clones taken from the same leaf were more often the same fingerprint. Highly distinctive fingerprints, which were more widely distributed, suggest that this technique could be used to follow individual clones. In addition to the common clonal type, multiple fingerprint bands were found over successive years, implying that, in Scotland, local overwintering asexual populations are the most common source of M. persicae in the following year.

TI Population dynamic interference among childhood diseases
AB Epidemiologists usually study the interaction between a host population and one parasitic infection. However, different parasite species effectively compete, in an ecological sense, for the same finite group of susceptible hosts, so there may be an indirect effect on the population dynamics of one disease due to epidemics of another. In human populations, recovery from any serious infection is normally preceded by a period of convalescense, during which infected individuals stay at home and are effectively shielded from exposure to other infectious diseases. We present a model fair the dynamics of two infectious diseases, incorporating a temporary removal of susceptibles. We use this model to explore population-level consequences of a temporary insusceptibility in childhood diseases, the dynamics of which are partly driven by differences in contact rates in and out of school terms. Significant population dynamic interference is predicted and cannot be dismissed in the limited case-study data available for measles and whooping cough in England before the vaccination era.

TI Within- and between-population variation for resistance of Daphnia magna
   to the bacterial endoparasite Pasteuria ramosa
AB Genetic variation among hosts for resistance to parasites is an important assumption underlying evolutionary theory of host and parasite evolution. Using the castrating bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa and its cladoceran host Daphnia magna, we examined both within- and between-population genetic variation for resistance. First, we tested hosts from four populations for genetic variation for resistance to three parasite isolates. Allozyme analysis revealed significant host population divergence and that genetic distance corresponds to geographic distance. Host and parasite fitness components showed strong genetic differences between parasite isolates for host population by parasite interactions and for clones within populations, whereas host population effects were significant for only a few traits. In a second experiment we tested explicitly for within-population differences in variation for resistance by challenging nine host clones from a single population with four different parasite spore doses. Strong clone and dose effects were evident. More susceptible clones also suffered higher costs once infected. The results indicate that within-population variation for resistance is high relative to between-population variation. We speculate that P. ramosa adapts to individual host clones rather than to its host population.

TI Explosive school-based measles outbreak - Intense exposure may have
   resulted in high risk, even among revaccinees
AB Even high levels of measles vaccination coverage have not always prevented outbreaks of measles spread by airborne transmission. It has been suggested that a targe inoculum might increase vaccine failure risk. Airborne transmission might occasionally entail a large measles inoculum. The epidemiologic relevance of measles among properly vaccinated persons (i.e., those vaccinated after 15 months of age and with live attenuated virus) is increased when they become contagious. The authors studied inoculum intensities as measured by proxy variables and the contagiousness of properly vaccinated persons who contracted measles among 51 measles patients infected in one school, at home, or elsewhere, utilizing preexisting records of measles cases and 214 healthy controls from an explosive school outbreak that occurred in a rural Finnish municipality in 1989. One "super-spreader" infected 22 others in one day, including eight once-vaccinated students and one twice-vaccinated student, probably during an assembly of 144 Students in a poorly ventilated hallway with no sunlight. Those infected later at home had high measles risk, even if they were revaccinees. When siblings shared a bedroom with a measles case, a 78 percent risk (seven out of nine children) was observed among vaccinees. Vaccinees had approximately 2 days' shorter incubation time than unvaccinated persons. Vaccinated and unvaccinated students were equally able to infect their siblings. Total protection against measles might not be achievable, even among revaccinees, when children are confronted with intense exposure to measles virus.

TI Selection and strain specificity of compatibility between snail
   intermediate hosts and their parasitic schistosomes
AB Many theoretical models of host-parasite coevolution assume that variation in host resistance to parasite infection is, at least partially, genetically determined and specific to the strain of infecting parasite. However, very few experimental studies have been conducted to test this assumption in animal-parasite systems. Biomphalaria glabrata snails serve as the intermediate hosts of Schistosoma mansoni. Although some snails are resistant to infection, there is no evidence of fixation of resistance in field populations. Two possible explanations for this are high fitness costs associated with resistance and a dynamic coevolution between parasite and host, perhaps involving matching alleles or gene-for-gene interactions. Two strains of B. glabrata were artificially selected for either resistance or susceptibility to each of two strains of S. mansoni parasite for three generations. Third-generation snails were then were exposed to either the parasite strain to which they had been selected or to a different parasite strain. In both host strains, resistance and susceptibility (compatibility) were found to be heritable. Moreover, compatibility to one parasite strain was not associated with compatibility to another strain, implying no genetic trade-off. Our results are discussed in terms of potential mechanisms of resistance in this host-parasite system and their implications to general coevolutionary theory.

TI Establishing genetic correlations involving parasite virulence
AB For many host-parasite interactions, virulence is necessarily affected by population densities, transmission biology of the parasite, and proliferation of the parasite at the expense of its host. Attempts to experimentally demonstrate genetic correlations involving virulence therefore need to employ protocols controlling for variation in the number of successful infections (i.e., the end-point of transmissibility). If protocols are not controlled, then correlations may be spurious, as appears to be the case in recent experimental studies by Ebert (1994) and Ebert and Magnin (1997). There is a need to explore the modes of the evolution of each of the many sequential steps in nonsymbiotic and symbiotic phases of host-parasite associations and the implication of such evolution for overall virulence. I argue that it is the interdependence of these sequential steps (and not overall virulence) that should be at the center of attempts to establish genetic correlations.

AB A recent outbreak of influenza in Hong Kong was caused by a highly virulent virus of avian origin. Concern that the appearance of such a virus in the human population may be a harbinger of a new pandemic has brought increased attention to the issue of antivirals available for treatment of influenza. A/HongKong/156/97 (H5N1), the first virus of H5N1 subtype isolated from a human host, is highly virulent in the mouse model and can infect mouse lungs without requiring adaptation. High mortality and evidence of systemic disease, including spread to the brain after intranasal inoculation, are observed. Zanamivir, a novel neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective at decreasing replication of the virus in vitro. In a model of lethal challenge in mice, zanamivir reduces lung titers of the virus and decreases morbidity and mortality.

TI The spatial dynamics of prion disease
AB An important component of the latency period of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases) can be attributed to delays during the propagation of the infectious prion isoform, PrPSc, through peripheral nervous tissues. A growing body of data report that the host prion protein, PrPC, is required in both peripheral and central nervous tissues for susceptibility to infection. We introduce a mathematical model, which treats the PrPSc as a mobile infectious pathogen, and show how peripheral delays can be understood in terms of the intercellular dispersal properties of the PrPSc strain, its decay rate, and its efficiency at transforming the PrPC. It has been observed that when two pathogenic strains co-infect a host, the presence of the first inoculated strain can slow down, or stop completely the spread of the second strain. This is thought to result from a reduced concentration of host protein available for conversion by the second strain. Our model can explain the mechanisms of such interstrain competition, and the time-course of the increased delay. The model provides a link between those data suggesting a role for a continuous chain of PrP-expressing tissue linking peripheral sites to the brain, and data on prion strain competition.

AB Parasite genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction was used to distinguish recrudescent from newly acquired Plasmodium falciparum infections in a Karen population resident on the northwestern border of Thailand where malaria transmission is low (one infection/person/year). Plasmodium falciparium infections were genotyped for allelic variation in three polymorphic antigen loci, merozoite surface proteins-1 and -2 (MSP-1 and -2) and glutamate-rich protein (GLURP), before and after antimalarial drug treatment. Population genotype frequencies were measured to provide the baseline information to calculate the probability of a new infection with a different or the same genotype to the initial pretreatment isolate. Overall, 38% of the infections detected following treatment had an identical genotype before and up to 121 days after treatment. These post-treatment genotypes were considered recrudescent because of the low (< 5%) probability of repeated occurrence by chance in the same patient, This approach allows studies of antimalarial drug treatment to be conducted in areas of low transmission since recrudescences can be distinguished confidently from newly acquired infections.

TI Limited genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in field isolates
   from Honduras
AB The genetic diversity displayed by Plasmodium falciparum field isolates, the occurrence of variant forms of the parasite at different frequencies in different geographic areas, and the complexity of the infections represent major obstacles for the development of effective malaria control measures. However, since most of the existing studies have been performed in regions where P. falciparum transmission is high, little is known about the diversity and complexity of parasite populations circulating in areas of low malaria endemicity. We investigated the extent of genetic polymorphism in P. falciparum field isolates from Honduras, a region where its transmission is low and seasonal. Allelic diversity was analyzed in the highly polymorphic parasite genes encoding the merozoite surface proteins-1 (MSP-1) and -2 (MSP-2) and the glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) by the polymerase chain reaction. Gene polymorphism was also assessed in the EB200 region derived from the highly size polymorphic Pf332 gene. Limited size polymorphism was detected in all genes analyzed, with four and three variants for the MSP-1 and MSP-2 alleles, respectively, and two size variants for the GLURP and Pf332 genes. Moreover, based on the studied genetic markers, most infections consisted of only a few genetically distinct parasite clones. These results suggest that the P, falciparum parasite populations circulating in this region are genetically homogeneous and point to an association between the extent of parasite genetic diversity and the intensity of malaria transmission.

   Diego Counties, California
AB During a screening program to determine the extent of hantavirus activity in Orange and San Diego Counties, California, serum samples from 2,365 rodents representing nine genera and 15 species were tested for hantavirus antibodies. A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on selected seropositive rodents was used to identify the specific hantavirus. Rodents positive for Sin Nombre virus (SNV) antibodies by Western blot included 86 (9.1 %) of 948 deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), four (1.5 %) of 275 California mice (Peromyscus californicus), one (0.5 %) of 196 cactus mice (Peromyscus eremicus), 51 (12.2 %) of 417 harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis), and five (12.5 %) of 40 California voles (Microtus californicus). All other specimens tested were negative for hantavirus antibodies. There was a correlation between age and sex of the reservoir host and prevalence of SNV antibody, especially among male deer mice and harvest mice. Few seasonal trends in antibody prevalence were observed and continued maintenance of SNV and Fl Moro Canyon virus was found at several foci over a 4-5-year period. Isla Vista virus was also found in voles and represents the first recorded in Orange County. Microhabitat selection on the part of these rodents based on plant density, plant height, and availability of food plants may explain, to some extent, all of the hantavirus-positive foci throughout the study area over a broad geographic range and the lack of antibody-positive rodents in dense chaparral, woodland, and riparian areas. The majority of rodents positive for SNV was identified from localities along coastal bluffs and the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains, where trap success was high and P. maniculatus represented 43 % of all rodents collected. Several residential, commercial, and industrial sites exist in these areas and the potential health risk should not be overlooked, This study represents an in-depth analysis of the prevalence, host distribution, and characteristics of rodent populations infected by three hantaviruses within a small, well-defined, geographic area.

However, advances in genome analysis (including the development of comprehensive sets of informative genetic markers, improved physical mapping methods, and novel techniques for transcript identification) have reduced the obstacles to discovery of novel host resistance genes. Study of the genomic organization and content of widely divergent vertebrate species has shown a remarkable degree of evolutionary conservation and enables meaningful cross-species comparison and analysis of newly discovered genes.

We review the rationale and resources for comparative genomic analysis and describe three examples of host resistance genes successfully identified by this approach.

TI Long-term studies of hantavirus reservoir populations in the
   southwestern United States: Rationale, potential, and methods
AB Hantaviruses are rodent-borne zoonotic agents that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Asia and Europe and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North and South America. The epidemiology of human diseases caused by these viruses is tied to the ecology of the rodent hosts, and effective control and prevention relies on a thorough understanding of host ecology. After the 1993 HPS outbreak in the southwestern United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiated long-term studies of the temporal dynamics of hantavirus infection in host populations. These studies, which used mark-recapture techniques on 24 trapping webs at nine sites in the southwestern United States, were designed to monitor changes in reservoir population densities and in the prevalence and incidence of infection; quantify environmental factors associated with these changes; and when linked to surveillance databases for HPS, lead to predictive models of human risk to be used in the design and implementation of control and prevention measures for human hantavirus disease.

TI Long-term hantavirus persistence in rodent populations in central
   Arizona
AB For 35 months, we monitored hantavirus activity in rodent populations in central Arizona. The most frequently captured hantavirus antibody-positive rodents were Peromyscus boylii and P. truei. Antibody-positive P. boylii were more frequently male (84%), older, and heavier, and they survived longer on trapping web sites than antibody-negative mice. The number of antibody-positive P. boylii was greater during high population densities than during low densities, while antibody prevalence was greater during low population densities. Virus transmission and incidence rates, also related to population densities, varied by trapping site. The spatial distribution of antibody-positive P. boylii varied by population density and reflected the species preference for dense chaparral habitats. The focal ranges of antibody-positive P. boylii also demonstrated a patchy distribution of hantavirus.

TI Long-term studies of hantavirus reservoir populations in the
   southwestern United States: A synthesis
AB A series of intensive, longitudinal, mark-recapture studies of hantavirus infection dynamics in reservoir populations in the southwestern United States indicates consistent patterns as well as important differences among sites and host-virus associations. All studies found a higher prevalence of infection in older (particularly male) mice; one study associated wounds with seropositivity. These findings are consistent with horizontal transmission and transmission through fighting between adult male rodents. Despite very low rodent densities at some sites, low-level hantavirus infection continued, perhaps because of persistent infection in a few long-lived rodents or periodic reintroduction of virus from neighboring populations. Prevalence of hantavirus antibody showed seasonal and multiyear patterns that suggested a delayed density-dependent relationship between prevalence and population density. Clear differences in population dynamics and patterns of infection among sites, sampling periods, and host species underscore the importance of replication and continuity of long-term reservoir studies. Nevertheless, the measurable associations between environmental variables, reservoir population density, rates of virus transmission, and prevalence of infection in host populations may improve our capacity to model processes influencing infection and predict increased risk for hantavirus transmission to humans.

TI Associations between parasitism and host genotype in natural populations
   of Daphnia (Crustacea : Cladocera)
AB 1. Numerous models of parasite - host coevolution have shown that parasitism could play a key role in a wide range of biological phenomena. One critical assumption underlying models of parasite-host coevolution is that natural selection acts on genetic variation for host susceptibility, but this assumption has rarely been tested in the wild.
   2. Clonal hosts are particularly suitable for detecting associations between genotypes and parasitism, because multi-locus gene complexes are preserved during reproduction, and following clonal selection, hosts which differ at resistance loci may also show differences at neutral marker loci. In this study, allozymes were used to search for associations between multi-locus host genotypes (clones) and parasitism within 25 cyclically parthenogenetic populations of Daphnia.
   3. Rates of parasitism were observed ranging from 0% to 48% of adult females. and infection by microparasites was found to significantly reduce host fecundity.
   4. Significant differences were detected between the clonal composition of parasitized and healthy Daphnia in 12 populations, showing that the proportion of individuals infected varies among clones. Six populations were sampled repeatedly to determine whether this variation was associated with temporal changes in both host clonal frequencies and population genetic characteristics (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. genotypic linkage disequilibrium). Three of the six temporally sampled populations showed changes in genetic structure that were consistent with the expectations of parasite-mediated selection, while the other three did not. These latter three populations all had low parasite prevalence (indicating low selection intensities) and or comprised primarily rare clones, thus limiting the statistical power of the study to detect parasite-mediated effects.
   5. The results show the presence of genetic variation for the likelihood of contracting disease within Daphnia populations. These associations between infection and host genotype could result from genetic variation for parasite resistance or within-pond spatial arrangement of both host genotypes and parasite prevalences. Either factor would lead to parasite-mediated selection and the modulation of gene frequecies within populations.

TI Selection of maternal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 variants in
   human placenta
AB To determine the mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) crosses the placenta into the fetal blood, 12 matched samples of serial maternal blood, term placentas, and infant blood obtained from a cohort of pregnant women in Cameroon identified as predominantly infected by subtype A viruses were studied. HIV-1 env sequences were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in both chorionic villi and enriched trophoblastic cells of all 12 placentas but at variable rates of detection. Heteroduplex mobility assay analysis showed the presence of multiple HIV-1 env quasispecies in sequential maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples, but only a small number of env variants were found in chorionic villi and enriched trophoblastic cells. These data indicate that HIV-1 env sequences are always present in term placentas of seropositive women, contrasting with the low frequency at which infection is diagnosed by PCR in neonates with tat, gag, and env primers. Maternal HIV-1 variants appear to undergo a strong negative selection by different cell populations within the placental villi.

TI Genetic variation of geminiviruses: comparison between sexual and
   asexual host plant populations
AB One of the most promising hypotheses for the evolution of sex is that sexual reproduction is advantageous because it increases the rate of adaptive evolution in response to parasites. To investigate this advantage of sex, we compared genetic variation of geminiviruses infecting sexual and asexual populations of Eupatorium (Asteraceae). The infection frequency was 37.5% in the sexual population and 87.8% in the asexual population. The lower infection frequency in the sexual population might be the result of higher genetic diversity of host plants. If geminiviruses have diverged to counter defence systems of genetically variable hosts, genetic diversity of viruses is expected to be higher in sexual host populations than in asexual host populations. To test this expectation, we used single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to examine genetic diversity of the geminiviruses in a DNA region containing the open-reading frame (ORF) C4 gene, which is known to function as a host range determinant. As predicted, higher genetic diversity of viruses was observed in the sexual population: three SSCP types were found in the asexual population while six types were found in the sexual population. Sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products revealed further genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed that the SSCP types belonged to four different clades. Several SSCP types from the same clade were found in the sexual population, whereas the asexual population included only one SSCP type from each clade. Amino acid replacements of ORF C4 are suggested to be accelerated in the sexual population. This evidence supports the hypothesis that sexual reproduction is advantageous as a defence against epidemic disease.

TI Genetic variability and structure of Canadian populations of
   Chondrostereum purpureum, a potential biophytocide
AB Genetic diversity was studied in four Canadian ecological populations, each corresponding to a Canadian ecozone, of Chondrostereum purpureum, including 93 isolates of various host origin. Pseudo-allelic frequencies were estimated at each of 22 putative RAPD loci by scoring for presence or absence of amplicons in haploid mycelial cultures. The analysis of the hierarchical population structure did not reveal any trend with regard to ecological or host origin. Total gene diversity (H(T)dagger = 0.288) was mostly attributable to diversity within populations (H(S)dagger = 0.269). In addition, the AMOVA analysis detected most of the molecular variability within subpopulations (89.3%; P < 0.001), whereas a significant (7.3%; P = 0.001) proportion of the gene diversity was found among subpopulations, within ecozones. The results indicate that C. purpureum is a highly heterogeneous pathogen with a continuously distributed population across Canada (G(ST)dagger = 0.048), and underscore the importance of considering the population structure in the process of its registration as a microbial control agent. A genotype isolated in either central or eastern Canada (ecozones 2, 4 and 5 populations) and selected for its potential as a biophytocide should be considered indigenous in any of these regions of intended use.

TI Prevalence of enteric hepatitis A and E viruses in the Mekong river
   delta region of Vietnam
AB A study of antibody prevalence for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) was carried out in southwestern Vietnam in an area adjacent to a known focus of epidemic HEV transmission. The purpose of this investigation was first to provide a prevalence measure of hepatitis infections, and second to determine the outbreak potential of HEV as a function of the susceptible population. Blood specimens collected from 646 persons in randomly selected village hamlets were examined by an ELISA for anti-HEV IgG and anti-HAV IgG. The prevalences of anti-HEV IgG and anti-HAV IgG were 9% and 97%, respectively. There was a significant increase (P < 0.01) in age-specific anti-HEV IgG. A notable increase in anti-HAV IgG prevalence (P < 0.0001) occurred between child populations 0-4 (64%) and 5-9 (95%) years of age. No evidence of familial clustering of anti-HEV IgG-positive individuals was detected, and household crowding was not associated with the spread of HEV. Boiling of water was found to be of protective value against HEV transmission. A relatively low prevalence of anti-HEV indicates considerable HEV outbreak potential, against a background of 1) poor, water-related hygiene/sanitation, 2) dependence on a (likely human/animal waste)-contaminated Mekong riverine system, and 3) periodic river flooding.

TI Serologic evidence for an epizootic dengue virus infecting toque
   macaques (Macaca sinica) at Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka
AB Dengue is one of the most rapidly emerging diseases in the tropics. Humans are the principal reservoir of dengue viruses. It is unclear if nonhuman primates also serve as a reservoir of human dengue viruses under certain conditions. In this study, a cross-sectional serologic survey was carried out to characterize the pattern of transmission of a recently identified dengue virus among toque macaques in Sri Lanka. The results indicated that an epizootic dengue virus was active among the macaques. A single epizootic had taken place between October 1986 and February 1987 during which 94% of the macaques within the 3 km(2) study site were exposed to the virus. The epizootic was highly focal in nature because macaques living 5 km from the study population were not exposed to the virus. The transmission of dengue viruses among macaques in the wild may have important public health implications.

TI The evolution of mating preferences and major histocompatibility complex
   genes
AB House mice prefer mates genetically dissimilar at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The highly polymorphic MHC genes control immunological self/nonself recognition; therefore. this mating preference may function to provide "good genes for an individual's offspring. However, the evidence for MHC-dependent mating preferences is controversial, and its function remains unclear. Here we provide a critical review of the studies on MHC-dependent mating preferences in mice, sheep, and humans and the possible functions of this behavior. There are three adaptive hypotheses for MHC-dependent mating preferences. First, MHC-disassortative mating preferences produce MHC-heterozygous offspring that may have enhanced immunocompetence. Although this hypothesis is not supported by tests of single parasites, MHC heterozygotes may be resistant to multiple parasites. Second, we propose that MHC-dependent mating preferences enable hosts to provide a "moving target" against rapidly evolving parasites that escape immune recognition (the Red Queen hypothesis). Such parasites are suspected to drive MHC diversity through rare-allele advantage. Thus, the two forms of parasite-mediated selection thought to drive MHC diversity, heterozygote and rare-allele advantage, will also favor MHC-dependent mating preferences. Finally, MHC-dependent mating preferences may also function to avoid inbreeding; a hypothesis consistent with other evidence that MHC genes play a role in kin recognition.

TI Microbiological safety of drinking water: United States and global
   perspectives
AB Waterborne disease statistics only begin to estimate the global burden of infectious diseases from contaminated drinking water. Diarrheal disease is dramatically underreported and etiologies seldom diagnosed. This review examines available data on waterborne disease incidence both in the United States and globally together with its limitations. The waterborne route of transmission is examined for bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens that either are frequently associated with drinking water (e.g., Shigella spp.), or for which there is strong evidence implicating the waterborne route of transmission (e.g., Leptospira spp.). In addition, crucial areas of research are discussed, including risks from selection of treatment-resistant pathogens, importance of environmental reservoirs, and new methodologies for pathogen-specific monitoring. To accurately assess risks from waterborne disease, it is necessary to understand pathogen distribution and survival strategies within water distribution systems and to apply methodologies that can detect not only the presence, but also the viability and infectivity of the pathogen.

TI Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in mutant mice deficient in both TCR
   alpha beta and TCR gamma delta cells: Cytokine and antibody responses
AB Resistance to Pneumocystis carinii is achieved through cell-mediated and humoral immunity, but the interplay between these two systems in the immunocompetent host is not fully understood. TCR beta x delta(-/-) double-mutant mice deficient of all T cell populations naturally acquired P. carinii pneumonia with lethal consequences. Moribund mutants displayed numbers of pulmonary pathogens comparable to RAG-1(-/-) mice lacking all functional T and B lymphocytes. Pulmonary lavage cells of diseased TCR beta x delta(-/-) mutants secreted proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12, and interferon-gamma, but not IL-4, -5, or -10. Serum immunoglobulin levels of both healthy and diseased mice were significantly reduced compared with immunocompetent animals. Secreted antibodies were mainly IgM, which also bound P. carinii. Mutants completely lacked IgG1, emphasizing strict T cell dependence of immunoglobulin switching to this isotype. Other IgG subclasses were strongly reduced and did not bind P. carinii. These results suggest that T cells are crucial for generation of antibodies against P. carinii relevant to resistance.

TI Interventions to control virus transmission during an outbreak of Ebola
   hemorrhagic fever: Experience from Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the
   Congo, 1995
AB On 6 May 1995, the Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) coordinator in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), received a request for assistance for what was believed to be a concurrent outbreak of bacillary dysentery and viral hemorrhagic fever (suspected Ebola hemorrhagic fever [EHF]) in the town of Kikwit, DRC. On 11 May, the MSF intervention team assessed Kikwit General Hospital. This initial assessment revealed a nonfunctional isolation ward for suspected EHF cases; a lack of water and electricity; no waste disposal system; and no protective gear for medical staff. The priorities set by MSF were to establish a functional isolation ward to deal with EHF and to distribute protective supplies to individuals who were involved with patient care. Before the intervention, 67 health workers contracted EHF; after the initiation of control measures, just 3 cases were reported among health staff and none among Red Cross volunteers involved in body burial.

TI Ecology of Marburg and Ebola viruses: Speculations and directions for
   future research
AB Marburg and virulent Ebola viruses are maintained in hosts that are rare and have little contact with humans or do not readily transmit virus. Bats (particularly solitary microchiropteran species) are leading contenders as reservoir hosts. Virus transfer to humans occurs by contact with the primary reservoir or via an intermediate animal that acquired infection from the reservoir and is, in turn, hunted by humans. An interesting possibility is that filoviruses may be arthropod or plant viruses, with non-blood-feeding arthropods transmitting the virus to intermediate hosts or humans during oral ingestion or envenomation. Paradoxically, in Africa, Ebola virus disease has high lethality and high seroprevalence as determined by the IFA test. If the seroreactivity is confirmed by more specific tests, then the Ebola virus serogroup in Africa probably contains an antigenically cross-reactive, enzootic, nonpathogenic agent(s). Such viruses may have separate life cycles or may give rise to virulent strains by mutation.

TI A model of insect-pathogen dynamics in which a pathogenic bacterium can
   also reproduce saprophytically
AB We developed a model of the population dynamic interaction between an insect and a pathogenic bacterium motivated by study of Serratia entomophila, a commercially exploited pathogen of the New Zealand grass grub (Costelytra zealandica). The bacterium is able to reproduce saprophytically, though it competes for saprophytic substrates with non-pathogenic strains, which appear to be superior competitors, probably because they lack a plasmid that carries genes required for pathogenicity. The effect of saprophytism and competition on the invasion criterion (Ro), short-term dynamics and long-term dynamics are described. Saprophytism can reduce (possibly to zero) the host threshold at which the pathogen can invade, though this reduction is less when there is competition with non-pathogenic strains. In a model of short-term population dynamics designed to mimic the application of bacteria to a host epizootic, saprophytism enhances the reduction in host density though again this is tempered by competition with non-pathogens. In the long term, a pathogen that can develop saprophytically can drive its host to extinction in the absence of competition with non-pathogens. When the latter are present, host extinction is prevented. The addition of saprophytic reproduction can stabilize an otherwise unstable host-pathogen model, but we were unable to find a stable equilibrium given the further addition of a wholly saprophytic bacterial strain. The model suggests that enhancing or selecting for saprophytic ability could be a way of improving biological control.

TI Epidemiology of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Texas
AB During 1987-1996, over 22,000 tuberculosis cases were reported in Texas, at an average annual incidence rate of 12.5 cases per 100,000 population, Counties with the highest rates were located along the Mexico-Texas border and in northwestern Texas. Nine percent of cases were resistant to at least one of the five first-line antituberculosis drugs used for treatment. Almost 5 percent (4.6%) were resistant to isoniazid, either alone or in combination with other antibiotics; 2.3% were resistant to rifampin; and only 1.3% were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin. Being a recurrent case, being foreign-born, being 20-39 years of age, and residing in a Mexico-Texas border county were independent risk factors for isoniazid resistance and rifampin resistance. Tuberculosis patients with human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection were more likely to have rifampin resistance and less likely to have isoniazid resistance than patients without HIV infection. Factors associated with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis included a history of previous tuberculosis (relative risk (RR) = 4.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5-6.8), non-US birth (RR = 2.69, 95% CI 2.1-3.5), age younger than 20 years (RR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.1-3.5), age 20-39 years (RR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.3-2.6), and residence in a Mexico-Texas border county (RR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.8-3.1).

TI Cost of resistance: relationship between reduced fertility and increased
   resistance in a snail-schistosome host-parasite system
AB Natural host populations often exhibit genetic variability in resistance to parasitism. One possible mechanism for maintaining such diversity is a trade-off between fitness costs associated with resistance and fitness costs associated with parasitism. However, little is known about the nature or magnitude of these costs in animal populations. Using artificial selection experiments in a Biomphalaria glabrata-Schistosoma mansoni hose-parasite system, we demonstrated that resistance and susceptibility to infection are heritable. We then investigated whether resistance had any associated costs in terms of snail reproductive success. Susceptible-selected snail lines showed significantly higher fertility (number of offspring produced) than resistant-selected or unselected control snail lines, irrespective of current infection status. There were no consistent differences between snail lines in fecundity proportion of abnormal egg masses produced, or mean number of eggs per egg mass. Mortality rare was higher among infected than uninfected snails. These results are consistent with snails incurring costs of resistance to schistosome infection in the absence of the parasite.

TI Ocular linguatuliasis in Ecuador: Case report and morphometric study of
   the larva of Linguatula serrata
AB Linguatula serrata is a pentastomid, a cosmopolitan parasite belonging to the Phylum Pentastomida. Humans may act as an intermediate or accidental definitive host of this parasite, manifesting the nasopharyngeal or visceral form, with the latter having been described more frequently. The occurrence of ocular linguatuliasis is extremely rare, but it has been reported in the United States and Israel. The objective of the present paper was to report the first case of ocular linguatuliasis in Ecuador and to extend the morphologic study of L. serrata by morphometric analysis. The patient studied was a 34-year old woman from Guayaquil, Ecuador who complained of ocular pain with conjunctivitis and visual difficulties of two-months duration. Biomicroscopic examination revealed a mobile body in the anterior chamber of the eye. The mobile body was surgically removed. The specimen was fixed in alcohol, cleared using the technique of Loos, stained with acetic carmine, and mounted on balsam between a slide and a coverslip. It was observed with stereoscopic and common light microscopes in combination with an automatic system for image analysis and processing. The morphologic and morphometric characteristics corresponded to the third-instar larval form of L. serrata. To our knowledge, ocular linguatuliasis has not been previously described in South America, with this being the first report for Ecuador and South America. The present study shows that computer morphometry can adequately contribute both to the morphologic study and to the systematic classification of Pentastomids, and L. serrata in particular.

TI Plasmodium falciparum clinical malaria in Dielmo, a holoendemic area in
   Senegal: No influence of acquired immunity on initial symptomatology and
   severity of malaria attacks
AB Six hundred eighty-nine Plasmodium falciparum malaria attacks were observed during a three-year period among 226 inhabitants of the village of Dielmo, Senegal, an area of high malaria transmission. Malaria attacks were defined as clinical episodes with fever (body temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 degrees C) or reporting of fever or headache or vomiting, associated with a parasite:leukocyte ratio above an age-dependent pyrogenic threshold identified in this population. The symptom frequencies were tested against age, gender, and parasite density using a random-effect logistic regression model and the study of distinguishable clinical presentations was carried out by multi-correspondence analysis. There was little difference between the severity of symptoms during the initial course of attacks in young children and adults, and this severity was not correlated with the duration of the pathologic episode. It was not possible to distinguish objectively different malaria attack types according to the severity of clinical manifestations. In contrast, the duration of fever, symptoms, and parasite clearance were significantly longer among the youngest children than among the oldest children and adults. These findings suggest that of the two components of protective immunity, anti-parasite immunity and anti-toxic immunity, only the first would play a major role as age increases. They suggest also that the initial clinical presentation of malaria attacks is not predictive of the level of protective immunity.

TI Malaria vectors in a traditional dry zone village in Sri Lanka
AB Malaria transmission by anopheline mosquitoes was studied in a traditional tank-irrigation-base rice-producing village in the malaria-endemic low country dry zone of northcentral Sri Lanka during the period August 1994-February 1997. Adult mosquitoes were collected from human and bovid bait catches, bovid-baited trap huts, indoor catches, and pit traps. Mosquito head-thoraces were tested for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, and blood-engorged abdomens for the presence of human blood by ELISAs. House surveys were done at two-day intervals to record cases of blood film-confirmed malaria among the villagers. A total of 7,823 female anophelines representing 14 species were collected. Trends in anopheline abundance were significantly correlated with rainfall of the preceding month in An. annularis, An. barbirostris, An. subpictus, An. vagus, and An. varuna, but were not significant in An. culicifacies and An. peditaeniatus. Malaria parasite infections were seen in seven mosquito species, with 75% of the positive mosquitoes containing P. falciparum and 25% P. vivax. Polymorph PV247 was recorded from a vector (i.e., Art. varuna) for the first time in Sri Lanka. Computations of mean number of infective vector (MIV) rates using abundance, circumsporozoite (CS) protein rate, and human blood index (HBI) showed the highest rate in An. culicifacies. A malaria outbreak occurred from October 1994 to January 1995 in which 45.5% of village residents experienced at least a single disease episode. Thereafter, malaria incidence remained low. Anopheles culicifacies abundance lagged by one month correlated positively with monthly malaria incidence during the outbreak period, and although this species ranked fifth in terms of abundance, infection was associated with a high MIV rate due to a high CS protein rate and HBI. Abundance trends in other species did not correlate significantly with malaria. It was concluded that An. culicifacies was epidemiologically the most important vector in the study area.

TI Parasitism of plant and animal hybrids: Are facts and fates the same?
AB This review analyzes the few studies on parasitism in natural animal hybrid zones, and compares the results to genetic and evolutionary hypotheses tested on plant models.

However, this comparison mostly emphasizes the similarities between the parasite distributions in hybrid populations, the genetic modes of the hybrid compatibility/resistance? and the evolutionary implications of the two systems. This preliminary analysis not only points out the need to diversify the parasite models studied for both plants and animals, but also emphasizes the relevance of animal models to progress in the understanding of the hybridization process and the host-parasite interactions.

TI Wolbachia infection and incompatibility dynamics in experimental
   selection lines
AB High and low levels of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) were selected for in the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis, in the single-infected strain Ti277. After nine generations of selection, males from lines selected for high incompatibility level (PII lines) were significantly more incompatible with uninfected females (AsymC) than the maternal strain. The reverse response, a full compatibility with AsymC, was observed in eight out of 12 lines selected for low incompatibility (LO lines), correlated with loss of Wolbachia infection. Bacterial density estimates in the eggs of some HI lines increased significantly. The procedure for line maintenance resulted in introgression of AsymC nuclear genome into the Ti277 background. Significant changes of CI level and bacterial density due to the introgression were also observed in the control lines, possibly reflecting an effect of host genotype on bacterial density and CI. After selection had been relaxed for six generations, bacterial density in the five high-infected HI lines declined back to a level comparable to the other lines. The data are consistent with the 'bacterial dosage' model, but with an upper threshold of bacterial infection above which there is no correlation between infection level and CI level. We further investigate the maternal transmission of bacterial density by a mother-daughter regression on bacterial density. The pattern observed is consistent with a density dependent regulation of bacterial numbers around an 'equilibrium' density, independent of any effects of CI. The equilibrium value is likely to be determined by both bacterial strain and host genotype.

TI Selfing versus outcrossing propensity of the fungal pathogen
   Microbotryum violaceum across Silene latifolia host plants
AB In the fungal pathogen Microbotryum violaceum mating (i.e, conjugation between cells of opposite mating type) is indispensable for infection of its host plant Silene latifolia. Since outcrossing opportunities are potentially rare, selfing may be appropriate to ensure reproduction. On the other hand, outcrossing may create genetic variability necessary in the coevolutionary arms race with its host.
   We investigated the propensity of M. violaceum to outcross vs, self in different host environments. We used haploid sporidia from each of three strains from five fungal populations for pairwise mixtures of opposite mating type, representing either selfing or outcrossing combinations. Mixtures were exposed to leaf extract from seven S. latifolia plants. The proportion of conjugated sporidia quantified mating propensity.
   The identity of both fungal strains and host influenced conjugation. First, individual strains differed in conjugation frequency by up to 30%, and strains differed in their performance across the different hosts. Second, selfing combinations produced, on average, more conjugations than did outcrossing combinations. Selfing appears to be the predominant mode of reproduction in this fungus, and selfing preference may have evolved as a mechanism of reproductive assurance. Third, individual strains varied considerably in conjugation frequency in selfing and outcrossing combinations across different hosts. This indicates that conjugation between outcrossing partners could be favoured at least in some hosts. Since the dikaryon resulting from conjugation is the infectious unit, conjugation frequency may correspond with infection probability. This assumption was supported by an inoculation experiment, where high infectious sporidial dosage resulted in higher infections success than did low dosage. We therefore predict that sexual recombination can provide this pathogen with novel genotypes able to infect local resistant hosts.

AB Lactobacilli, a component of the normal vaginal flora, can activate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) in the Jurkat T lymphocyte and THP-1 macrophage cell lines. Activation of the LTR in Jurkat cells was strongly enhanced by vanadate and inhibited by catalase, implicating H2O2. In contrast, activation in THP-1 cells occurred in the absence of vanadate and was unaffected by catalase, The active material partitioned into the phenol layer on hot aqueous phenol extraction, Lactobacilli also increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta production and activated NF-kappa B in THP-1 cells and increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by human monocytes. Human vaginal fluid specimens had comparable properties, which correlated with their bacterial content. These findings suggest the presence in vaginal fluid of agent(s) derived from indigenous bacteria that can activate the HIV-1 LTR, cytokine production, and NF-kappa B in cells of macrophage lineage, with possible influence on vaginal physiology and host defense.

TI How intracellular bacteria survive: Surface modifications that promote
   resistance to host innate immune responses
AB Bacterial pathogens regulate the expression of virulence factors in response to environmental signals. In the case of salmonellae, many virulence factors are regulated via PhoP/PhoQ, a two-component signal transduction system that is repressed by magnesium and calcium in vitro. PhoP/PhoQ-activated genes promote intracellular survival within macrophages, whereas PhoP-repressed genes promote entrance into epithelial cells and macrophages by macropinocytosis and stimulate epithelial cell cytokine production. PhoP-activated genes include those that alter the cell envelope through structural alterations of lipopolysaccharide and lipid A, the bioactive component of lipopolysaccharide. PhoP-activated changes in the bacterial envelope likely promote intracellular survival by increasing resistance to host cationic antimicrobial peptides and decreasing host cell cytokine production.

In a mouse model of infection with the intramacrophage protozoan Leishmania major, susceptibility correlates both with aberrant helper T cell differentiation biased towards the production of interleukin 4 and with the presence of an endogenous CD4 T cell repertoire that recognizes an immunodominant parasite antigen with high frequency. In the setting of the particular ecological niche occupied by Leishmania, this combination of otherwise unrelated factors synergizes to result in exquisite susceptibility to this single pathogen, without seemingly compromising host defenses against other agents. Similar paradigms could underlie susceptibility to other pathogenic organisms.

TI Selecting hyperparasites for biocontrol of Dutch elm disease
AB Hyperparasites in the form of cytoplasmic RNA elements have been proposed as a biological control agent for Dutch elm disease. We characterized the range of outcomes likely to follow the introduction of such an agent by modelling the resultant population dynamics as an ecological interaction between the wild 'target' fungus and the hyperparasitized 'control' fungus. We used data from the 1970s epidemic of Dutch elm disease in the UK to parameterize the population dynamics of the target fungus, and considered the success of control across a wide range of possibilities for the lethality and transmissibility of the modified control fungus. We decomposed hyperparasite transmissibility into horizontal transmissibility (the ability to colonize previously unparasitized target fungal hosts) and vertical transmissibility (the ability of control fungus to establish new colonies). There is an invasion threshold for both horizontal and vertical transmissibility. As vertical transmission is further increased, there is another threshold at which the target fungus is eradicated because of competitivie exclusion by the control fungus. In contrast, eradication by raising horizontal transmission may never succeed because the target fungus needs to be present to support new cases through this route. Between these two thresholds for invasion and exclusion, the control and target fungi may coexist. Using a stochastic, spatially extended model, we showed that predictions of success based on high competitive ability of the control fungus (i.e. high vertical transmission) are likely to be more robust than those based on the high degree to which the control fungus can cause the target fungus to be hyperparasitized (i.e. high horizontal transmission).

TI Gene flow and geographically structured coevolution
AB Many of the dynamic properties of coevolution may occur at the level of interacting populations, with local adaptation acting as a force of diversification, as migration between populations homogenizes these isolated interactions. This interplay between local adaptation and migration may be particularly important in structuring interactions that vary from mutualism to antagonism across the range of an interacting set of species, such as those between some plants and their insect herbivores, mammals and trypanosome parasites, and bacteria and plasmids that confer antibiotic resistance. Here we present a simple geographically structured genetic model of a coevolutionary interaction that varies between mutualism and antagonism among communities linked by migration. Inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow alters the outcomes of local interactions and allows the maintenance of allelic polymorphism across all communities under a range of selection intensities and rates of migration. Furthermore, inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow allows fu;ed mutualisms to be evolutionarily stable within both communities! even when selection on the interaction is antagonistic within one community. Moreover, the model demonstrates that the inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow may lead to considerable local maladaptation and trait mismatching as predicted by the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.

TI Regulation of the mucosal immune response
AB Infectious diseases continue to exact an extensive toll on populations living closest to the equatorial regions of the globe. A substantial proportion of these infections gain access to the host via the mucosal tissues. Thus, the development of new vaccines that enhance mucosal immunity is considered to be of paramount importance in order to prevent or limit the impact of these infections. Mucosal immune responses must discriminate between commensal flora within the lumen and potential pathogens. These responses are highly adapted to induce protection without excessive amounts of inflammation. The balances that regulate mucosal immune and inflammatory responses have to be understood if effective mucosal immunity is to be induced through local immunization. This review will summarize some of the unique properties of mucosal immune responses and focus on recent advances that have significantly influenced our understanding of the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses following infection.

TI Immune-epithelial interactions in host defense
AB Over the past 15 years, it has become very clear that the immune system can have profound effects on epithelial function. Acute immune-mediated changes in epithelial physiology are beneficial to host defense against enteric pathogens. For example, ion secretion washes out noxious luminal contents and increased permeability allows phagocytic cells and antibodies to enter the gut lumen. However, ongoing immune activation results in chronic effects that may be pathophysiologic. Responses are mediated by soluble immune mediators that act directly on the epithelium, or indirectly via nerves that also serve to amplify the epithelial response. Here, we will review some of the recent advances that have been made in the field of immunophysiology. The effect of mast cells on transport functions of the epithelium will be reviewed, with emphasis on the consequence of interactions between mast cells and nerves. The use of in vitro coculture systems has recently provided considerable information on the effects of neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes on epithelial functions; the contribution of each immunocyte will be highlighted. Finally, we will describe evidence for the active participation of the epithelium in mucosal immune activation, including pathogen or cytokine induced epithelial cytokine synthesis or secretion and adhesion molecule expression.

TI Integration of neuro-endocrine immune responses in defense of mucosal
   surfaces
AB Neuro-endocrine immunology, a field arising from curiosity about the mind-body connection, is evolving rapidly. From intriguing, but seemingly unexplainable observations with human infections and disease, experimental systems have been developed that provide a solid scientific basis for new understanding. There have been major efforts to understand influences of the nervous system on immune and inflammatory responses, e.g., innervation of the immune system, molecular communication pathways, and complex phenomena such as conditioning of immune responses and mechanisms of host defenses. In turn, the immune system communicates with the neuro-endocrine systems. Imbalances in the neuro-endocrine-immunologic circuitry are relevant in host defenses and in injury and repair. Examples of these themes in neuro-endocrine-immunology arise in several host-parasite models of neurogenic inflammation, immediate hypersensitivity responses, and granuloma formation. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the cervical sympathetic trunk-submandibular gland axis provide important models to enhance understanding of this poorly known component of the host-parasite relationship.

TI Epidemic and endemic seroprevalence of antibodies to Cryptosporidium and
   Giardia in residents of three communities with different drinking water
   supplies
AB This study was carried out to compare cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis seroprevalence rates in residents of three communities. Community (Com 1) uses drinking water from deep wells, community 2 (Com 2) uses surface water from a protected watershed, and community 3 (Com 3) uses surface water frequently containing Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. Unfiltered drinking water from each community was collected at the tap and tested for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts during the 12 months in which sera were collected for testing. No oocysts or cysts were detected in the water from the Com 1 deep wells; oocysts and cysts were detected intermittently in the drinking water from the other two communities. A waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred in a municipality adjacent to Com 3 six months into this 12-month study. Sera from residents of each of the communities were collected proportionately by month and by population size. Coded sera were tested for IgG to Cryptosporidium using a previously developed Western blotting method. The presence or absence of bands at 15-17 kD and/or 27 kD was recorded for the 1,944 sera tested. Definite bands at 15-17 kD and/or 27 kD were detected in 981 (50.5%) of the sera. A total of 33.2% of sera from Com 1 (community using deep wells) were positive using the same criteria compared with 53.5% (Com 2) and 52.5% (Com 3) of sera from the two communities using surface drinking water Both bands (15-17 kD plus 27 kD) were detected in 582 sera (29.9%) from the three communities: 14.1% of sera from Com 1 compared with 32.7% from Com 2 and 31.5% from Corn 3, These findings are consistent with a lower risk of exposure to Cryptosporidium from drinking water obtained from deep well sources. However, analysis of results by calendar quarter showed a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the number of Com 3 positive sera (compared with Com I) following the waterborne outbreak. Without this outbreak-related observation, a significant overall difference in seropositivity would not have been seen. We also observed that in sera from the community affected by the outbreak, the presence on immunoblots of both Cryptosporidium bands appeared to be the best indicator of recent infection. Seroprevalence rates using an ELISA to detect IgG to Giardia were estimated using the same sera. Overall 30.3% (590 of 1,944) of sera were positive by the ELISA. A total of 19.1% of sera from Com 1, 34.7% from Com 2 and 16.0% from Com 3 were seropositive. Rates for both Com 3 and Corn 1 did not change significantly over time. In Com 2, rates decreased significantly (P < 0.001) during the last half of the study period (third and fourth calendar quarters). The reasons for the decrease in seroprevalence in Com 2 sera are presently not known. These studies show intriguing associations between seroprevalence, outbreak-related laboratory serologic data, and patterns of parasite contamination of drinking water. Further studies are required to validate the serologic approach to risk assessment of waterborne parasitic infections at a community level.

AB We carried out a seroepidemiologic survey to define the prevalence of human T cell lymphotropic virus types 1/2 (HTLV-1/2) infections among aboriginal populations from isolated regions of northern Argentina and the Amazon region of Peru, Antibodies against HTLV were measured with agglutination tests and confirmed with by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blotting. Five (6.94%) of 72 samples from the Tobas Indians in Argentina were positive by the LFA; two samples were typed as HTLV-1 (2.78%), two as HTLV-2 (2.78%), and one (1.39%) could not be typed because it had similar antibody titers against both viruses. No positive samples were found among 84 Andinos Punenos and 47 Matacos Wichis Indians. Seroprevalences of 2.50% (1 of 40) and 1.43% (1 of 70) for HTLV-1 were observed among Wayku and San Francisco communities in the Amazon region of Peru, and seroprevalences of 4.54% (1 of 22) and 2.38% (1 of 42) for HTLV-2 were observed among Boca Colorada and Galilea communities. No serologic evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was found among the Indians tested. These results indicated the presence of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in the indigenous populations of Argentina and Peru. Moreover, the lack of HIV infection indicates that the virus has probably not yet been introduced into these populations.

TI The evolution of costly resistance in host-parasite systems
AB Pairwise invadability analysis is used to examine the evolutionary dynamics of host resistance to microparasitic infection. A continuum of strains of the host differs in susceptibility to infection, with less susceptible strains paying a cost resulting in a lower intrinsic growth rate. With a combination of analytical and graphical pairwise invadability analysis, we show that the evolutionary outcome depends crucially on the shape of the constraint function between resistance and its assumed cost in intrinsic growth rates. When resistance is increasingly costly, a single evolutionarily stable strategy is predicted. Alternatively, with decreasingly costly resistance, we find that the hosts lend to be maximally resistant or not at all resistant. There are conditions under which dimorphism of both these types exists but intermediate resistances do not occur. Independently of the trade-off function used, we are always more likely to get resistant strains of the host when the carrying capacity of the host is high. The pathogenicity of the parasite is also important in determining the likelihood and degree of resistance.

TI Local maladaptation in the anther-smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum to
   its host plant Silene latifolia: Evidence from a cross-inoculation
   experiment
AB Conventional wisdom holds that parasites evolve more rapidly than their hosts and are therefore locally adapted, that is, better at exploiting sympatric than allopatric hosts. We studied local adaptation in the insect-transmitted fungal pathogen Microbotryum violaceum and its host plant Silene latifolia. Infection success was tested in sympatric (local) and allopatric (foreign) combinations of pathogen and host from 14 natural populations from a metapopulation. Seedlings from, up to 10 seed families from each population were exposed to sporidial suspensions from each of four fungal strains derived from the same population, from a near-by population (< 10 km distance), and from two populations at an intermediate (< 30 km) and remote (< 170 km) distance, respectively. We obtained significant pathogen X plant interactions in infection success (proportion of diseased plants) at both fungal population and strain level. There was an overall pattern of local maladaptation of this pathogen: average fungal infection success was significantly lower on sympatric hosts (mean proportion of diseased plants = 0.32 +/- 0.03 SE) than on allopatric hosts (0.40 +/- 0.02). Five of the 14 fungal populations showed no strong reduction in infection success on sympatric hosts, and three even tended to perform better on sympatric hosts. This pattern is consistent with models of time-lagged cycles predicting patterns of local adaptation in host-parasite systems to emerge only on average. Several factors may restrict the evolutionary potential of this pathogen relative to that of its host. First, a predominantly selfing breeding system may limit its ability to generate new virulence types by sexual recombination, whereas the obligately outcrossing host S. latifolia may profit from rearrangement of resistance alleles by random mating. Second, populations often harbor only a few infected individuals, so virulence variation may be further reduced by drift. Third, migration rates among host plant populations are much higher than among pathogen populations, possibly because pollinators prefer healthy over diseased plants. Migration among partly isolated populations may therefore introduce novel host plant resistance variants more often than novel parasite virulence variants. That migration contributes to the coevolutionary dynamics in this system is supported by the geographic pattern of infectivity. Infection success increased over the first 10-km range of host-pathogen population distances, which is likely the natural range of gene exchange.

TI Dynamic and genetic consequences of variation in horizontal transmission
   for a microparasitic infection
AB Transmission to a new host is a critical step in the life cycle of a parasite. Variation in the characteristics of the transmission process, for example, due to host demography, is assumed to select for different variants of the parasite. We have experimentally tested how variation in the time to transmission (early or late after infection) and exposure to adverse conditions outside the host (immediate or delayed contact with new host) interact to determine the success of the infection in the next host, using the trypanosome Crithidia bombi infecting its bumblebee host, Bombus terrestris. These two experimentally manageable steps mimic the processes of within- and among-host selection for the parasite. We found that early transmission led to higher infection success in the next host as did immediate contact with the new host. However, there was no interaction between the two parameters as would be expected if early-transmitted variants, resulting from rapid multiplication within the host, would be less adapted to the conditions encountered during the between-host transfer or infection of the next host. Furthermore, typing the genetic variability of the parasites with microsatellites showed that the four different transmission routes of our experiment selected for different degrees of allelic diversity of the infecting parasite populations. The results support the idea that variation in the transmission process selects for different genotypic variants of the parasite. At the same time, the relationship of allelic diversity with infection intensity suggested that the coinfection model of May and Nowak (1995) maybe appropriate, where each parasite is able to infect and multiply independent of others within the same host.

TI Does immune challenge affect torpor duration?
AB 1. Hibernation may alter the relationship between pathogens and their hosts; low host temperatures can prevent pathogen replication. Therefore, manipulating the timing and duration of torpor bouts could allow animals to gain an advantage over pathogens.
   2, Thirty-two Turkish Hamsters (Mesocricetus brandti) were placed in short-day cold conditions. After 10 weeks, 20 animals were challenged with an antigen to simulate a pathogen infection. Ten of these animals were returned to the cold ('cold-challenged'). The other 10 animals were placed in warm conditions ('warm-challenged'). Twelve animals received saline injections and were returned to the cold ('cold-control'). Cold-challenged animals spent significantly more time in torpor than did cold-control animals.
   3, After 6.5 weeks, all animals were housed in warm conditions and ceased torpor. Both cold-challenged and warm-challenged animals received a second injection of antigen. There was no correlation between time spent euthermic and level of secondary humoral response of cold-challenged animals. The secondary humoral response of the cold-challenged animals was significantly lower than that of warm-challenged animals.
   4. Ln this study immune status influenced torpor duration, and torpor caused immunosuppression. Hibernators may manipulate body temperature in order to combat pathogens while their own immune systems are suppressed.

   of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance in patients attending a

AB A molecular analysis of drug-resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was done in a population with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Seventy-one consecutive isolates were tested for genotypic resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and automated sequencing of target regions. Phenotypic and genotypic resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol were detected in 23.4%, 11.2%, 7%, and 5.6% of isolates and in 87%, 88%, 40%, and 100% of resistant isolates, respectively. Specificity was 100% for all target regions. When rpoB, katG, and ahpC mutation analysis were combined, 86% of resistant isolates to any drug were identified. No mutations in inhA were found in isoniazid-resistant isolates. Molecular detection of drug resistance, particularly for isoniazid and rifampicin, may represent a sensitive and very specific technique. The strategy of selecting rpoB, katG, and ahp C to quickly identify most resistant isolates, with a relevant saving of resources, is warranted.

TI Male-killing Wolbachia in two species of insect
AB The inherited bacterium Wolbachia spreads through the manipulation of host reproduction, and has been suggested to be an important factor in arthropod evolution: from host speciation to the evolution of sex-determination systems. Past work has shown that members of this group may produce cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminize genetically male hosts, and induce host parthenogenesis. Here, we report an expansion of the range of reproductive manipulations produced by members of this clade, recording Wolbachia strains that kill male hosts during embryogenesis in two host species, the ladybird Adalia bipunctata, and the butterfly Acraea encedon. Both male-killing bacteria belong to the B group of Wolbachia. However, phylogenetic analyses were unable to resolve whether the bacteria in the two species are monophyletic, or represent independent origins of male-killing among the B-group Wolbachia. We also found significant divergence within the wsp gene of Wolbachia strains found in different A. bipunctata individuals, suggesting this host species contains two Wolbachia strains, diverged in wsp sequence but monophyletic. Our observations reinforce the notion that Wobbachia may be an important agent driving arthropod evolution, and corroborates previous suggestions that male-killing behaviour is easily evolved by invertebrate symbionts.

TI Effect of chemotherapy on malaria transmission among Yanomani
   Amerindians: Simulated consequences of placebo treatment
AB To determine whether chemotherapy effectively reduces Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in isolated human populations, we followed two abrupt sequential outbreaks of malaria infection among Yanomami Amerindians and modeled the effect of chemotherapy and the consequences if no drug was available. A Macdonald-type mathematical model demonstrated that both outbreaks comprised a single epidemic event linked by an Invisible outbreak in vector mosquitoes. The basic reproductive number, R-0, from fitted values based on the treated epidemic was 2 during the initial phase of the epidemic, and waned as vector density decreased with the onset of the dry season. In the observed epidemic, 60 (45%) of 132 village residents were affected, and che treated outbreak ended after two months. Although the initial chemotherapy regimen was only marginally effective, the duration of human infectivity was reduced from an expected nine months to two weeks. In the absence of this intervention, the initial R-0 value would have been 40, more than 60% of the population would have been infected, and more than 30% would have remained parasitemic until the next rainy season (about six months later). Another outbreak would then have ensued, and malaria probably would have remained endemic in this village. Our simulated placebo treatment permits us to conclude that even partially effective chemotherapeutic interventions, such as those in our study, interrupt serial transmission of P. falciparum among isolated human populations that are exposed to infection seasonally.

TI Spatial and temporal patterns in coevolving plant and pathogen
   associations
AB Spatial structuring is important in understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of natural populations since local demes are rarely, if ever, completely isolated from neighboring demes. Plant host-pathogen interactions provide good examples of coevolutionary systems where both numerical and genetic dynamics have been explicitly investigated in a spatial context and where genes under selection can be unambiguously identified. In this article, we focus on long-term studies of several natural host-pathogen interactions that span a range of life histories and taxa. We use these studies to evaluate some predictions for numerical and genetic patterns at local and regional scales. Specifically, we examine the degree of among-population asynchrony in disease presence/absence and abundance, and the extent to which this is a function of isolation. For one host-pathogen interaction (Linum-Melampsora), we focus on whether there is local correspondence between resistance and virulence genes las would be predicted by single-population coevolutionary models) or whether such correspondence occurs at larger spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the implications of these studies with respect to the impact of host and pathogen life-history variation on the spatial scale of coevolutionary interactions. Understanding coevolutionary interactions in nature requires a multidisciplinary approach, including long-term empirical studies of multiple populations and computer modeling.

TI Migration, virulence, and the geographic mosaic of adaptation by
   parasites
AB The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is predicated on structured populations of interacting species where gene flow and the force of selection can vary among populations, leading to a mosaic of traits in space. Here, I briefly review some recent studies of adaptation by a sterilizing parasite to structured populations of a freshwater snail. The results show geographic structure as expected under the geographic mosaic model. I then consider the effects of virulence and migration on local adaptation by parasites using a computer simulation. The results suggest that high virulence and low migration contribute to the strength of local adaptation by parasites. Highly virulent parasites showed adaptation to local hosts for migration rates of up to 10% of the population per generation. In addition, because of the dynamic nature of host-parasite coevolution, the magnitude of local adaptation fluctuates over time. During some points in the cycle, parasites may be no more effective at infecting individuals from local host populations, even though they would be shown to be locally adapted if examined over enough generations. Contrary to expectation, parasite local adaptation was not affected by giving the parasite a longer generation time than the host, but differences in local selection intensities had a dramatic effect.

TI Specific hypotheses on the geographic mosaic of coevolution
AB Coevolution is one of the major processes organizing the earth's biodiversity. The need to understand coevolution as an ongoing process has grown as ecological concerns have risen over the dynamics of rapidly changing biological communities, the conservation of genetic diversity, and the population biology of diseases. The biggest current challenge is to understand how coevolution operates across broad geographic landscapes, linking local ecological processes with phylogeographic patterns. The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution provides a framework for asking how coevolution continually reshapes interactions across different spatial and temporal scales. It produces specific hypotheses on how geographically structured coevolution differs from coevolution at the local scale. It also provides a framework for understanding how local maladaptation can result from coevolution and why coevolved interactions may rarely produce long lists of coevolved traits that become fixed within species. Long-term field studies of the same interaction across multiple communities and spatially structured mathematical models are together beginning to show that coevolution may be a more important ongoing process than had been indicated by earlier empirical and theoretical studies lacking a geographic perspective.

TI An integrated assessment framework for climate change and infectious
   diseases
AB Many potential human health effects have been hypothesized to result either directly or indirectly from global climate change. Changes in the prevalence and spread of infectious diseases are some of the most widely cited potential effects of climate change, and could have significant consequences for human health as well as economic and societal impacts. These changes in disease incidence would be mediated through biologic, ecologic, sociologic, and epidemiologic processes that interact with each other and which may themselves be influenced by climate change. Although hypothesized infectious disease effects have been widely discussed, there have not yet been thorough quantitative studies addressing the many processes at work. In part this is because of the complexity of the many indirect and feedback interactions or mechanisms that bear on all aspects of the climate issue. It also results from the difficulty of including the multitude of always-changing determinants of these diseases. This paper proposes a framework for an integrated assessment of the impacts of climate change an infectious diseases. The framework allows identification of potentially important indirect interactions or mechanisms, identification of important research gaps, and a means of integrating targeted research from a variety of disciplines into an enhanced understanding of the whole system.

TI Specificity and host predictability: a comparative analysis among
   monogenean parasites of fish
AB 1, This article compares generalist (parasite species found on two or more host species) and specialist (found on only one host species) monogenean parasite species of fish. The reduction of the host range - that is an increase in host specificity - may correspond with a better adaptation of the parasite to a more predictable host environment. A more predictable environment may allow the parasite species to develop specific adaptations.
   2, We assume that the more predictable host environment can be evaluated by host body size, since numerous life-traits, such as longevity, are positively correlated with size.
   3. We found that specialist parasites parasitize larger hosts species than generalist parasites. We also found a good relationship between host body size and parasite body size for specialist parasite species.
   4. An adaptation to the mechanical problems encountered in the host's gill chamber may lead to an increase in parasite body size. The infection of a larger part of the host population in order to decrease the chances of local extinction due to fluctuations of host abundance may be another adaptive mechanism.
   5, We found a negative correlation between parasite body size and prevalence for generalist parasite species. This relationship disappeared when using the comparative method controlling for phylogeny, which proved that it was a phylogenetic effect.

TI Host resources govern the specificity of swiftlet lice: size matters
AB 1. An important component of parasite diversity is the specificity for particular host taxa shown by many parasites. Specificity is often assumed to imply adaptive specialization by the parasite to its host, such that parasites are incapable of surviving and reproducing on 'foreign' hosts.
   2. Specificity, however, need not be due to adaptation to particular hosts. Some parasites may be specific simply because they are incapable of dispersing among host taxa. For example, 'permanent' parasites like chewing lice spend their entire lifecycle on the body of the host and require direct contact between hosts for dispersal.
   3. The role of adaptive constraints in parasite host-specificity has seldom been tested in natural populations. We conducted such a test by comparing the relative fitness of host-specific lice experimentally transferred among closely related species of cave swiftlets in northern Borneo.
   4. The survival of lice in most of these transfers was significantly reduced in proportion to the mean difference in feather barb size between the donor and recipient species of hosts. Thus, adaptation to a particular resource on the body of the host does appear to govern the specificity of swiftlet lice.
   5. In transfers where lice survived, microhabitat shifting on the body of the host was observed, whereby the mean barb diameter of the feathers on which the lice occurred was held 'constant'.

   2, Hunting records from 1965 to 1994 were obtained from 210 hunting areas and analysed at three spatial scales: subpopulation, population and metapopulation. Rock partridge exhibited cyclic fluctuations in about 40% of the time series with a period of 4-7 years. The results did not change with spatial scale. The density-dependent structure of the populations showed that most populations exhibited damped oscillations.
   3. The proportion of populations that were in synchrony increased with scale from the population to metapopulation level. There was no decline in synchrony with distance but a large variation between populations irrespective of distance.
   4. The populations clustered into dry and wet habitats, with those in the dry habitat being more cyclic. We suggest the lack of spatial synchrony with distance but greater synchrony within habitats may reflect the influence of stochastic events operating on populations with different density dependence structures.

AB Two overlapping sets of TT virus (TTV)-specific polymerase chain reaction primers were used to test for presence of TTV, which was found in approximately 10% of US volunteer blood donors, 13% of commercial blood donors, and 17% of intravenous drug abusers. The rate of TTV infection among US non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis patients was only 2%. Among commercial blood donors and intravenous drug abusers, only 1%-3% of the TTV-positive individuals were coinfected with GB virus C (GBV-C), a parenterally transmitted virus. This suggests that GBV-C and TTV may have different routes of transmission. Comparison of the sensitivities of 2 TTV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets showed that the majority of samples were detected with only 1 of the 2 sets. Therefore, previous studies in which only a single PCR primer pair was used may have significantly underestimated the true prevalence of TTV.

AB Inoculation of chimpanzees with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been used as a model system to define mechanisms of pathogenesis and to test protective efficacy of candidate HIV-1 vaccines. In most of these studies, the animals were inoculated intravenously. However, because HIV-1 is transmitted primarily across mucosal surfaces, future evaluations of vaccines should employ mucosal routes for administering infectious virus to immunized animals. To develop a model of rectal transmission of HIV-1, chimpanzees were exposed without trauma to 4 different HIV-1 strains at doses ranging from 200 to 10,000 TCIDs. Infection, characterized by seroconversion and repeated isolation of virus from lymphocytes, was established in 1 of 5 animals. This animal was sequentially inoculated with a subtype B and then an E strain and was infected with both strains. The results show that rectal exposure of adult chimpanzees to cell-free HIV-1 was not an efficient mode of transmission in this cohort.

AB If human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccines are to be highly effective, it is essential to understand the virologic factors that contribute to HIV-1 transmission, It is likely that transmission is determined, in part, by the genotype or phenotype (or both) of infectious virus present in the index case, which in turn will influence the quantity of virus that may be exchanged during sexual contact. Transmission may also depend on the fitness of the virus for replication in the exposed individual, which may be influenced by whether a virus encounters a target cell that Is susceptible to Infection by that specific variant. Of interest, our data suggest that the complexity of the virus that is transmitted may be different in female and male sexual exposures.

TI Mucosal dendritic cells and immunodeficiency viruses
AB Dendritic cells [DCs] have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). When skin was used as a model for mucosae, the cutaneous DC-T cell milieu allowed the growth of HIV-1 and much of the newly produced virus could be detected in multinucleated DC-T cell syncytia. Such virus replication occurs irrespective of the genetic subtype, the syncytium- and non-syncytium-inducing capacities of the viruses, and whether they are classified as T cell- or macrophage-tropic. Similar DC-syncytia have been identified within the mucosal surfaces of the tonsillar tissue of HIV-1-infected persons. More recently, it was demonstrated that DC-T cell mixtures from the skin, mucosae, and blood of healthy macaques similarly support the replication of simian immunodeficiency virus. In both the human and monkey systems, active virus replication requires the presence of both DCs and T cells. Further studies using the macaque model are underway to elucidate the role of DCs in the transmission and spread of HIV infection.

TI Co-infection with opportunistic pathogens promotes human
   immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in macrophages
AB Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is dependent on susceptible host cells that express both CD4 and chemokine co-receptors. The co-receptor CCR5 is associated with primary infection by macrophage-tropic virus isolates, whereas CXCR4 is commonly associated with T cell- and dual-tropic viruses. Once infected, lymphocytes and macrophages may replicate HIV-1 or harbor latent virus, depending on environmental factors and cellular activation. Immune activation is often associated with viremia, which is consistent with enhanced infection and viral replication in activated cells harboring virus. In this regard, opportunistic infections activate the immune system with the detrimental sequelae of enhanced viral replication and viremia. Under these conditions, viral expansion extends beyond T cells to tissue macrophages, many of which are co-infected with opportunistic pathogens. The opportunistic infections promote macrophage susceptibility to HIV-1 through cytokine modulation and altered chemokine co-receptors, potential targets for intervention.

TI Genetic diversity of rhizobia from Leucaena leucocephala nodules in
   Mexican soils
AB Leucaena species are leguminous plants native to Mexico. Using two L. leucocephala cultivars grown in different soils, we obtained 150 isolates from the nodules. Twelve rDNA types were identified which clustered into groups corresponding to Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, and Sinorhizobium by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of amplified 16S rRNA genes. Types 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 were distinct from all the defined species. Others had patterns indistinguishable from some recognized species. Most of the isolates corresponded to Sinorhizobium 12. Forty-one electrophoretic types (ETs) were identified among the isolates based on the different combinations of electrophoretic patterns of 13 metabolic enzymes. ETs were clustered into groups in general agreement with the rDNA types. Diverse plasmid patterns were obtained among the isolates, but common plasmids were observed among most isolates within rDNA types 5, 10, and 11. The symbiotic plasmids were identified among most of the isolates, except for the Mesorhizobium isolates. The affinities of host cultivars for different rhizobial groups and the impact of sail cultivation an the soil populations of rhizobia were analysed from the estimation of isolation frequencies and diversity. The results showed differences in rhizobial populations in cultivated and uncultivated soils and also differences in rhizobia trapped by L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham or Peruvian.

TI Contribution of calystegine catabolic plasmid to competitive
   colonization of the rhizosphere of calystegine-producing plants by
   Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm41
AB Calystegines are plant secondary metabolites produced by the roots of a few plant species, and the ability to catabolize calystegines is infrequent in rhizosphere bacteria. In Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm41, the endosymbiont of the legume Medicago sativa, this ability results from the presence of the genes cac (for calystegine catabolism) located on the nonsymbiotic plasmid pRme41a. The effect of the cac catabolic plasmid pRme41a on the ability of Rm41 to colonize the rhizosphere of calystegine-positive plants was studied using derivatives of Rm41 with or without cac catabolic plasmid. When strains were inoculated alone, the presence of a cac catabolic plasmid had no effect on their colonization of the rhizosphere, regardless of whether plants produced calystegines or not. However, a spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutant of Rm41 containing a cac catabolic plasmid reached population levels in the rhizosphere of calystegine-positive plants that were several orders of magnitude higher than those of the same strain without the plasmid, when each Tvas co-inoculated with a derivative of Rm41 cured of pRme41a. In contrast, the cac catabolic plasmid provided little or no selective advantage in the rhizosphere of calystegine-negative plants. In conclusion, the cac catabolic plasmid pRme41a can contribute to the ability of S. meliloti Rm41 to colonize the rhizosphere of alternative, nonlegume plant hosts producing calystegines.

TI First do no harm: Making oral rehydration solution safer in a cholera
   epidemic
AB Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is lifesaving therapy for cholera and pediatric diarrhea. During a cholera epidemic in Guinea-Bissau, we evaluated the microbiologic quality of ORS prepared at a hospital and tested a simple intervention using special vessels for disinfecting tap water with bleach and for preparing, storing, and dispensing ORS. Few coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli were recovered from tap water; however, pre-intervention ORS contained numerous bacteria including E. coli and toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1. In contrast, ORS samples from intervention vessels had few or no coliform bacteria, no E. coli, and no V. cholerae. Mean pre-intervention counts of coliform bacteria (3.4 x 10(7) colony-forming units [cfu]/100 mi) and E. coli (6.2 x 10(3) cfu) decreased significantly during the intervention period to 3.6 x 10(2) cfu and 0 cfu, respectively (P < 0.001). This simple system using bleach disinfectant and special storage vessels prevents bacterial contamination of ORS and reduces the risk of nosocomial transmission of cholera and other enteric pathogens.

TI Density-dependent processes in the population dynamics of a bird
   ectoparasite Ceratophyllus gallinae
AB The hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae (Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae) is a common ectoparasite in Blue Tit Parus caeruleus nests, whereby adult fleas draw blood from the incubating female host and from the nestlings. Host-parasite interactions are influenced by density-dependent growth of the parasite population, which may result from competitive exploitation or interference between parasite individuals, or from density-dependent host defenses. Understanding density dependence in host-parasite interactions is important for understanding the evolution of parasite virulence and of host defense. Here we investigate density-dependent processes in the dynamics of flea subpopulations. In a first experiment, intended to establish the importance of density dependence in this host-parasite system, the founder density of parasites was manipulated, and reproductive rates of parasites measured. A second experiment was designed to identify the demographic levels at which density dependence arises in the growth of the hen flea population. The experiments show that parasite reproductive rates significantly decrease with increasing founder density. The patterns of egg production, larval production, and adult flea survival suggest that competition between larvae is the main process behind the density-dependent pattern of subpopulation growth. Host mortality, body condition, and blood hematocrit level of the female host and the nestlings were not significantly affected by parasite load, suggesting that adult fleas are not food limited at high densities.

TI Genetic relationships between parasite virulence and transmission in the
   rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi
AB Many parasites evolve to become virulent rather than benign mutualists. One of the major theoretical models of parasite virulence postulates that this is because rapid within-host replication rates are necessary for successful transmission (parasite fitness) and that virulence (damage to the host) is an unavoidable consequence of this rapid replication. Two fundamental assumptions underlying this so-called evolutionary trade-off model have rarely been tested empirically: (1) that higher replication rates lead to higher levels of virulence; and (2) that higher replication rates lead to higher transmission. Both of these relationships must have a genetic basis for this evolutionary hypothesis to be relevant. These assumptions were tested in the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi, by examining genetic relationships between virulence and transmission traits across a population of eight parasite clones isolated from the wild. Each clone was injected into groups of inbred mice in a controlled laboratory environment, and replication rate (measured by maximum asexual parasitemia), virulence (measured by live-weight loss and degree of anemia in the mouse), and transmission (measured by density of sexual forms, gametocytes, in the blood and proportion of mosquitoes infected after taking a blood-meal from the mouse) were assessed. It was found that clones differed widely in these traits and these clone differences were repeatable over successive blood passages. Virulence traits were strongly phenotypically and genetically (i.e., across clones) correlated to maximum parasitemia thus supporting the first assumption that rapid replication causes higher virulence. Transmission traits were also positively phenotypically and genetically correlated to parasitemia, which supports the second assumption that rapid replication leads to higher transmission. Thus, two assumptions of the parasite-centered trade-off model of the evolution of virulence were shown to be justified in malaria parasites.

TI Resistance and virulence structure in two Linum marginale-Melampsora
   lini host-pathogen metapopulations with different mating systems
AB Different patterns of resistance to six pathotypes of Melampsora lini were detected in 11 populations of Linum marginale distributed across two metapopulations. The two metapopulations (mountains and plains of New South Wales, Australia) differed in the annual cycle of disease development, which barely overlapped, and in the growth cycle and mating system of the host. Host populations in the mountains metapopulation were highly inbred, whereas those on the plains showed appreciable levels of outcrossing. Within each metapopulation there was significant variation among component populations in (1) levels of host resistance to individual pathogen isolates; (2) mean levels of resistance to all six isolates; (3) the number of resistance phenotypes present and the evenness of their distribution within the population; and (4) the average number of pathogen lines to which individual hosts were resistant. A more limited comparison of pathogen populations from the two metapopulations (two from each) found greater similarities in the structure of populations and particular virulence frequencies within, rather than among, the two metapopulations. Differences in host outcrossing rates between the two metapopulations are reflected in marked differences in the overall level of resistance, its partitioning within and among populations, the number and distribution of resistance phenotypes in the two areas, and the level of polymorphism for specific virulence factors in the pathogen, with the plains metapopulation showing consistently higher values. However, these differences were not significant. In general, variation for all parameters was just as great among populations within a metapopulation as between the two metapopulations.

TI Sexually transmitted disease and parasite-mediated sexual selection
AB Few studies have investigated the consequences of parasite-mediated sexual selection on the parasites involved. In some cases parasite-mediated sexual selection could lead to increased virulence, but I develop a simple model that shows that, if a parasite is sexually transmitted (i.e., isa sexually transmitted disease, or STD) and if mating success of the host is adversely affected by the parasite, then less virulent STDs will be selected for because transmission of the STD depends on the mating success of the host. This selection for reduced virulence could have important consequences for the role of STDs in sexual selection.

TI Cross-resistance following artificial selection for increased defense
   against parasitoids in Drosophila melanogaster
AB An increase in resistance to one natural enemy may result in no correlated change, a positive correlated change, or a negative correlated change in the ability of the host or prey to resist other natural enemies. The type of specificity is important in understanding the evolutionary response to natural enemies and was studied here in a Drosaphila-parasitoid system. Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for increased larval resistance to the endoparasitoid wasps Asobara tabida or Leptopilina boulardi were exposed to attack by A. tabida, L. boulardi and Leptopilina heterotama at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25 degrees C. In general, encapsulation ability increased with temperature, with the exception of the lines selected against L. boulardi, which showed the opposite trend. Lines selected against L, boulardi showed large increases in resistance against all three parasitoid species, and showed similar levels of defense against A. tabida to the lines selected against that parasitoid. In contrast, lines selected against A. tabida showed a large increase in resistance to A. tabida and generally to L. heterotoma, but displayed only a small change in their ability to survive attack by L. boulardi. Such asymmetries in correlated responses to selection for increased resistance to natural enemies may influence host-parasitoid community structure.

TI Short-term and long-term effects of food supply on parasite burdens in
   Tawny Owls, Strix aluco
AB 1. The relationships among food supply (Field Voles, Microtus agrestis), reproduction and blood parasites was investigated in Tawny Owls, Strix aluco, in Kielder Forest, Northumberland, in 1994 and 1995. Vole populations were significantly lower in 1995 than in 1994.
   2. Birds did not lose parasites after initial infection, and the level at which infections were maintained was characteristic of individual birds.
   3. In 1994, the number and intensity of parasites was higher in adult owls that had experienced low food supply when they themselves were reared. This indicated that food supplied to chicks in the nest has a long-term effect on the parasite burden of adults.
   4. In addition, there was evidence that parasite burdens of adults were influenced by their current food supply. Birds that suffered a decline in food abundance on their territories between 1994 and 1995 showed an increase in parasite load over the same period. In 1995, there was also a significant negative correlation between the parasite loads of owls and vole abundance on their territories.
   5. The best predictor of parasite number of chicks reared in 1995 was the parasite load of their fathers. The parasites chicks developed were not the parasites with which their fathers were heavily infested. This result could be due to inherited immunity.
   6. Our results indicated that food resources should be measured when investigating interactions between parasites and their hosts, and that offspring quality as well as quantity might suffer when food abundance is low.

TI Hepatitis C prevalence and risk factors in the northern Alberta dialysis
   population
AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an emerging global public health issue with particular relevance in multiply transfused renal dialysis patients. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for HCV infection among renal dialysis patients in northern Alberta, Canada. Ninety-two percent of eligible patients (n = 336) provided informed consent to participate. Participants were interviewed to gather risk factor information and, using multiple logistic regression analysis with exact inference, a predictive model for HCV infection in this population was developed. The prevalence of HCV infection in the population was 6.5%, and all positive patients had at least one identifiable risk factor. The multivariate analysis showed that the risk of HCV infection was greater for those in the 18-55 years age category (odds ratio (OR) = 4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-27.9), patients who had been on dialysis >5 years (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-12.0), and patients who had greater than or equal to 2 high risk lifestyle behaviors (OR = 5.0, 95% CI 1.5-16.7). Transfusion prior to 1990 was marginally associated with HCV status (OR = 4.0, 95% CI 0.96-16.3). This study documented previously unreported life-style risk factors for HCV infection in patients with renal failure, confirmed the expected decline in transfusion-acquired HCV infection in this population, and provided evidence against nosocomial transmission of HCV.

TI Predicting malaria infection in Gambian children from satellite data and
   bed net use surveys: The importance of spatial correlation in the
   interpretation of results
AB In line with the renewed World Health Organization Global Malaria Control Strategy, we have advocated the use of satellite imagery by control services to provide environmental information for malaria stratification, monitoring, and early warning. To achieve this operationally, appropriate methodologies must be developed for integrating environmental and epidemiologic data into models that can be used by decision-makers for improved resource allocation. Using methodologies developed for the Famine Early Warning Systems and spatial statistics, we show a significant association between age related malaria infection in Gambian children and the amount of seasonal environmental greenness as measured using the normalized difference vegetation index derived from satellite data. The resulting model is used to predict changes in malaria prevalence rates in children resulting from different bed net control scenarios.

   in British Columbia, Canada
AB Isolates from 25 (13 sporadic and 12 outbreak) cryptosporidiosis cases, 24 of which were from British Columbia, Canada, were characterized using nested polymerase chain reaction amplification of the polymorphic internal transcribed spacer I locus. Two predominant Cryptosporidium parvum genotypes were found. Twelve (8 sporadic and 4 outbreak) isolates amplified with the cry7/cry21 primer pair and 12 (5 sporadic and 7 outbreak) isolates amplified with the cry7/cryITS1 primer pair. Multi-locus gene analysis using sequence polymorphisms on 3 other loci, i.e., the thrombospondin-related adhesion protein gene, the dihydrofolate reductase gene, and the 18S rRNA gene on 8 (4 outbreak and 4 sporadic) isolates showed non-random association among the human and animal alleles of the 4 different C. parvum gene loci. Associations between these 2 parasite genotypes and different routes of cryptosporidiosis transmission such as zoonotic, anthroponotic, and waterborne transmission were studied using municipal population and agricultural information, as well as detection of C. parvum oocysts in municipal drinking water specimens of the residential communities of sporadic and outbreak cases.

TI Markedly high seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in

   infections in selected Solomon Islands populations
AB To determine the prevalences of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infections in residents of the Solomon Islands, we surveyed 1,610 serum samples from 1,113 outpatients and 497 healthy volunteer blood donors at the Central Hospital in Honiara, the Solomon Islands. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (n = 315, 19.6%) was significantly different from that of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) by a second-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (n = 4, 0.2%) and antibody to HTLV-1 (anti-HTLV-l) by an ELISA with Western blot analysis to verify the positivity (n = 49, 3.0%) (P < 0.0001, respectively). There were no significant differences in the prevalences of these markers between outpatients and blood donors. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was detected by RIA in 130 (41.3%) of 315 HBsAg-positive samples. The distribution of HBsAg subtypes by EIA was 190 adr (60.3%), 111 ayw (35.2%), and 14 (0.4%) other subtypes. The HBeAg prevalence decreased with age in all groups for each subtype. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of HBeAg among HBsAg subtypes. We conclude that HBV infection is highly endemic in selected Solomon Islands populations, and that the high prevalence of HBeAg may be associated with the spread of HBV infection there.

TI Relationships between malaria prevalence and malaria-related morbidity
   in school children from two villages in central Africa
AB To investigate the relationship between parasite prevalence and malaria-related morbidity, we carried out a comparative study among cohorts of school children from two villages, Dienga, Gabon, and Pouma, Cameroon, both located in malaria-endemic areas. Seven to 17 year-old children attending primary schools were similarly followed-up at each site to evaluate the frequency of malaria attacks. Follow-up involved daily temperature recording (and blood smears in the case of fever) and preparation of blood smears every two weeks. In Pouma, 186 children were followed-up for six months. In Dienga, 228 children were followed-up for nine months. The mean prevalence rate of Plasmodium falciparum infections (as assessed by the blood smears) was twice as high in Pouma compared with Dienga (45.2% versus 26.8%; P < 0.0001), whereas the monthly malaria attack rate (as assessed by the daily surveillance) was twice as high in Dienga compared with Pouma (21.5% versus 41.4%; P = 0.003). The possible implication of several parameters that may differ between the two areas, such as the malaria transmission level, the economical and social status of the inhabitants, the characteristics of infecting parasite strains, and the genetic background of the population, is discussed.

TI Short report: Entomologic inoculation rates and Plasmodium falciparum
   malaria prevalence in Africa
AB Epidemiologic patterns of malaria infection are governed by environmental parameters that regulate vector populations of Anopheles mosquitoes. The intensity of malaria parasite transmission is normally expressed as the entomologic inoculation rate (EIR), the product of the vector biting rate times the proportion of mosquitoes infected with sporozoite-stage malaria parasites. Malaria transmission intensity in Africa is highly variable with annual EIRs ranging from < 1 to > 1,000 infective bites per person per year. Malaria control programs often seek to reduce morbidity and mortality due to malaria by reducing or eliminating malaria parasite transmission by mosquitoes. This report evaluates data from 31 sites throughout Africa to establish fundamental relationships between annual EIRs and the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection. The majority of sites fitted a linear relationship (r(2) = 0.71) between malaria prevalence and the logarithm of the annual EIR. Some sites with EIRs < 5 infective bites per year had levels of P. falciparum prevalence exceeding 40%. When transmission exceeded 15 infective bites per year, there were no sites with prevalence rates < 50%. Annual EIRs of 200 or greater were consistently associated with prevalence rates > 80%. The basic relationship between EIR and P. falciparum prevalence, which likely holds in east and west Africa, and across different ecologic zones, shows convincingly that substantial reductions in malaria prevalence are likely to be achieved only when EIRs are reduced to levels less than 1 infective bite per person per year. The analysis also highlights that the EIR is a more direct measure of transmission intensity than traditional measures of malaria prevalence or hospital-based measures of infection or disease incidence. As such, malaria field programs need to consider both entomologic and clinical assessments of the efficacy of transmission control measures.

TI The intra- and interspecific relationships between abundance and
   distribution in helminth parasites of birds
AB 1. Positive correlations between local abundance and distribution on a larger spatial scale are commonly observed among related species.
   2. Within parasite species, the same relationship may be expected between prevalence and intensity of infection across host species used. Across parasite species, a positive relationship is expected between average abundance in a host population and the number of host species that can be exploited based on the resource breadth hypothesis. Trade-offs between the ability to exploit many host species and the potential for heavy infections, however, could result in a negative relationship.
   3. Intraspecifically, using data on 51 helminth species parasitic in birds, prevalence and intensity of infection among host species used are generally only weakly correlated. Only in nematodes is there an overall positive relationship between prevalence and intensity.
   4. A comparative analysis was performed on data from 389 species of cestodes, trematodes and nematodes parasitic in birds to determine how host specificity covaries interspecifically with abundance, measured both as prevalence and intensity of infection.
   5. After controlling for phylogenetic influences and sampling effort, the number of host species used correlated positively with prevalence in all three parasite taxa, and with intensity of infection in trematodes only.
   6. These results do not support the existence of a trade-off between abundance and the use of many host species, as has been found for fish parasites. Instead, whatever makes helminth parasites of birds abundant within a host population may facilitate their successful colonization of new host species.

TI The influence of parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia on the oviposition
   behaviour and sex-specific developmental requirements of autoparasitoid
   wasps
AB Parthenogenesis-inducing (PI) Wolbachia are bacteria that cause incipient male eggs of parasitoid wasps to develop as females. These microbes may invade populations and lead to fixation of parthenogenesis. In this study, the consequences of fixation of PI Wolbachia on evolution of behaviour and development were addressed in three species of whitefly parasitoids in the genus Encarsia.
   Most sexual Encarsia are obligate autoparasitoids. In these haplodiploid wasps, fertilized, female-producing eggs are laid in whitefly or scale insect nymphs, while unfertilized, male-producing eggs are laid in immature parasitoids within the homopteran integument. The oviposition behaviour and progeny developmental requirements of unmated females of a sexual autoparasitoid species were compared with two species that were fixed for PI Wolbachia. All species were treated with antibiotics, effectively 'curing' the asexual species of Wolbachia infection.
   As expected, unmated females of the sexual species, E. pergandiella, laid few eggs in whiteflies relative to immature parasitoids, and males emerged exclusively from parasitoids. In contrast, females of one of the parthenogenetic species, E. formosa, laid few eggs in parasitoids relative to whiteflies, and male progeny emerged exclusively from whiteflies. Females of the second parthenogenetic species, E. hispida, were intermediate in their oviposition behaviour. Females laid eggs in both wasps and whiteflies. However, all of the males except one emerged from the whiteflies. The results suggest that the association of autoparasitoids and PI Wolbachia may result in dramatic evolutionary change of both host selection behaviour and developmental requirements of the infected wasps.

TI Evolution of oviposition strategies and speciation in the globeflower
   flies Chiastocheta spp. (Anthomyiidae)
AB Trollius europaeus (Ranunculaceae) is involved in an intimate interaction with several species of Chiastocheta flies (Anthamyiidae) that are both seed predators and pollinators. In this paper, we analyse the oviposition strategy of the six Chiastocheta species found to coexist on T. europaeus in 19 populations from the French Alps. We shaw that the species are not equivalent in their oviposition behaviour:, C. rotundiventris usually deposits no more:than one egg per flower in first-day flowers whereas C. dentifera aggregates ifs eggs on fruits and thus does not contribute to pollination at all; the four remaining species deposit eggs sequentially during the flowering period from the 2nd to the :7th day. Hence, the outcomes of the interaction in terms of net Seed production for the plant greatly depend on the Chiastocheta species visiting it,ranging from a mutualistic to a purely-parasitic interaction. We assessed mitochondrial divergence between Chiastocheta spp: by sequencing a 1320-bp mitochondrial DNA fragment. The low divergence observed between species (0-4-15%) suggests that genus diversification took place recently. Unlike in other plant-insect systems where diversification is usually thought to be driven by cospeciation or host shifts we propose that Chiastocheta speciation took place within the host plant. Basal separation of a particularly mutualistic species provided favourable conditions far plant specialization on this seed-parasite as: a pollinator early in the evolution of the association. The parasitic species ovipositing on fruits derived from a species ovipositing on flowers. Diversification of the intermediate strategies probably occurred in relation with the Pleistocene climatic events, reproductive isolation between species being reinforced by niche partitioning for oviposition and/or sexual selection.

Twenty-two of 35 infants who became infected in 1995-1997 had mothers who did not receive antiretroviral therapy, although counseling practices improved with time. In 1995, 87% of the mothers of HIV-seropositive infants were counseled, whereas in 1997, 96% were counseled (P<.005), None of 59 infants tested had high-level phenotypic zidovudine resistance, although 5 (8.8%) of 57 infants had virus isolates with at least one mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene associated with reduced phenotypic susceptibility to zidovudine.

   children in a United States/Mexico border community: Evidence for
   transitory infection
AB Helicobacter pylori infection has been linked to a spectrum of gastroduodenal diseases of broad public health impact, yet the natural history of this frequently asymptomatic infection remains poorly understood. Evidence suggests that initial acquisition occurs primarily during childhood and may persist throughout life. The seroprevalence of H. pylori antibodies was examined in 365 primary schoolchildren aged 4-7 years in a low-income United States/Mexico border community from January to May 1996. Overall, 21% of the 365 children tested positive, with a significant monotonic decrease in seroprevalence by 1-year age intervals (36% in children aged 4 years, 24% in those aged 5 years, 20% in those aged 6 years, and 14% in those aged 7 years). The odds ratio for each 1-year age increase was 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.6, 1.0) after adjustment for relevant covariates. Given that H. pylori antibodies diminish after infection clears, this trend suggests that transient infection may be common in young children. In contrast, hepatitis A virus seroprevalence increased with age. There was a moderate association (odds ratio = 1.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.8, 2.9) of H. pylori with hepatitis A virus seroprevalence that weakened after adjustment for age and socioeconomic status (odds ratio = 1.26, 95% confidence interval: 0.6, 2.5). Follow-up studies are needed to clarify the natural history of Helicobactor pylori infection and identify predictors of initial acquisition, persistence, and recurrence.

Greater longevity can impair the fitness of host organisms subject to pathogen attack, by reducing the mortality rate of infected hosts and thus creating a larger and more persistent reservoir of disease, from which infection can spread to the healthy population. Where longer-lived and shorter-lived hosts can infect one another (and thus all share the same risk of infection), selection will favor longer-lived individuals, to the detriment of the host population as a whole. But in metapopulations, selection can favor shorter-lived hosts that are otherwise identical to their longer-lived competitors, because the populations in which they occur will have lower incidence of disease. Under some conditions, shorter-lived hosts can even invade metapopulations of longer-lived hosts, displacing them and driving them to extinction. Our results support three general propositions. First, an organism's life-history traits, and not just its resistance genes, can affect its risk of pathogen attack. Second, pathogen-mediated selection may therefore influence the evolution of host life-history traits that are unrelated to resistance, per se. Third, the magnitude-and even the direction-of selection on host longevity can depend on the structure of the host population.

TI Simulation studies of phase III clinical trials to test the efficacy of
   a candidate HIV-1 vaccine
AB One question of particular importance in phase III HIV vaccine trials is the choice of efficacy measure (EM) to validly and precisely estimate the true vaccinal efficacy. Traditional EMs, based on hazard rate ratio (HRR) or cumulative incidence ratio (CIR) are time-sensitive to mode of vaccine action and population heterogeneities. Through Monte-Carlo simulation, the performance of HRR and CIR based EMs are examined across different trial designs and vaccine and population characteristics. A new EM based on log-spline hazard regression (HARE) is proposed. Given that vaccinal properties (mode of action, time-lag, waning) are unknown a priori, appropriate selection of EM is problematic, and HRR and CIR can be unreliable to estimate the true maximum efficacy of candidate products. Non-random sexual mixing can exacerbate biases in HRR and CIR. HARE can offer valid estimation across different modes of vaccine action and in presence of frailty effects, contrary to its traditional counterparts. Our simulation studies highlight the weaknesses of widely used EMs while offering guidelines for trial design and suggesting new avenues for statistical analysis.

TI Risk factors for monoinfections and coinfections with HIV, hepatitis B
   and hepatitis C viruses in northern Spanish prisoners
AB A cross-sectional study was conducted in prisons of Cantabria (northern Spain) from June 1992 to December 1994. Inmates were asked to participate in a survey on prevalence and risk factors for monoinfections and coinfections with HIV, HBV and HCV. Crude and multiple odds ratios of risk factors were calculated (by polychotomous logistic regression). Prevalence of coinfections was higher than that of monoinfections. IDU risk factors were the main independent variables associated with monoinfections and coinfections with these agents. The strength of association increased with the degree of coinfection for IDU risk factors and penal status, e.g. duration of injecting drug use for more than 5 years yielded an adjusted OR ranging from 1.3 (95 % CI: 0.4-5.1) for HBV monoinfection to 180 (95 % CI: 61.0-540.0) for HIV-HBV-HCV coinfection. In comparison, sexual behaviours were less important than IDU risk factors.

TI Wolbachia and the evolution of reproductive isolation between
   Drosophilla recens and Drosophila subquinaria
AB Endosymbiotic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are widespread among insects and in many cases cause cytoplasmic incompatibility in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Such findings have been used to argue that Wolbachia have played an important role in insect speciation. Theoretical models, however, indicate that Wolbachia alone are unlikely to lead to stable reproductive isolation between two formerly conspecific populations. Here we analyze the components of reproductive isolation between Drosophila recens, which is infected with Wolbachia. and its uninfected sister species Drosophila subquinaria. Laboratory pairings demonstrated that gene flow via matings between D, recens females and D. subquinaria males is hindered by behavioral isolation. Matings readily occurred in the reciprocal cross (D. quinaria females X D. recens males), but very few viable progeny were produced. The production of viable hybrids via this route was restored by antibiotic curing of D. recens of their Wolbachia symbionts, indicating that hybrid offspring production is greatly reduced by cytoplasmic incompatibility in the crosses involving infected D. recens males. Thus, behavioral isolation and Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility act as complementary asymmetrical isolating mechanisms between these two species. In accordance with Haldane's rule, hybrid females were fertile, whereas hybrid males invariably were sterile. Levels of mtDNA variation in D. recens are much lower than in either D. subquinaria or D. falleni, neither of which is infected with Wolbachia. The low haplotype diversity in D. recens is likely due to an mtDNA sweep associated with the spread of Wolbachia. Nevertheless, the existence of several mtDNA haplotypes in this species indicates that Wolbachia have been present as a potential isolating mechanism for a substantial period of evolutionary time. Finally, we argue that although Wolbachia by themselves are unlikely to bring about speciation, they can increase the rate of speciation in insects.

TI Parasite-mediated selection against inbred Soay sheep in a free-living,
   island population
AB Parasites are thought to provide a selective force capable of promoting genetic variation in natural populations. One rarely considered pathway for this action is via parasite-mediated selection against inbreeding. If parasites impose a fitness cost on their host and the offspring of close relatives have greater susceptibility to parasites due to the increased homozygosity that results from inbreeding, then parasite-mediated mortality may select against inbred individuals. This hypothesis has not yet been tested within a natural vertebrate population. Here we show that relatively inbred Soay sheep (Ovis aries), as assessed by microsatellite heterozygosity, are more susceptible to parasitism by gastrointestinal nematodes, with interactions indicating,greatest susceptibility among adult sheep at high population density. During periods of high overwinter mortality on the island of Hirta, St. Kilda, Scotland, highly parasitised individuals were less likely to survive. More inbred individuals were also less likely to survive, which is due to their increased susceptibility to parasitism, because survival was random with respect to inbreeding among sheep that were experimentally cleared of their gastrointestinal parasite burden by anthelminthic treatment. As a consequence of this selection, average microsatellite heterozygosity increases with age in St. Kildan Soay sheep. We suggest that parasite-mediated selection acts to maintain genetic variation in this small island population by removing less heterozygous individuals.

TI The persistence of a SIS disease in a metapopulation
AB 1. Deterministic models predict that susceptible-infective-susceptible (SIS) disease, where there is no immunity to reinfection following recovery, will become infinitely persistent in a host population. We explored the incorporation of stochasticity into SIS models; modelled interacting host-disease agents in metapopulations; and examined model predictions in a real system involving viral infection in domestic cats.
   2. SIS models incorporating stochasticity predicted that disease persistence would be finite and dependent on the host population size, provided the host population was isolated. However, the disease may persist by dynamic spread among interacting host metapopulations.
   3. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) dynamics in domestic cats were well predicted by stochastic metapopulation models.
   4. The models we present are mathematically tractable, generalizable, and mechanistically realistic. The findings from the cat-virus system are immediately applicable to the management of cattery populations and could be adapted to inform eradication programmes for other infectious diseases in animal and human populations. The most practical methods to eradicate feline enteric coranovirus would be to remove small catteries (islands) from interactions with large catteries (mainlands) and to convert mainlands to islands by depopulation.

AB The efficacy and safety of zanamivir, administered 2X or 4X daily over 5 days, was evaluated in the treatment of influenza infections. A total of 1256 patients entered the study; 57% of those randomized had laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. The primary end point, "alleviation of major symptoms," was created to evaluate differences in clinical impact. In the overall population with or without influenza infection, zanamivir reduced the median number of days to reach this end point by 1 day (P = .012 2X daily vs, placebo; P = .014 4X daily vs. placebo). The reduction was greater in patients treated within 30 h of symptom onset, febrile at study entry, and in defined high-risk groups. Zanamivir reduced nights of disturbed sleep, time to resumption of normal activities, and use of symptom relief medications. It was well tolerated. These results suggest that zanamivir can significantly reduce the duration and overall symptomatic effect of influenza.

TI Widespread atypical cutaneous Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (L.)
   chagasi in Nicaragua
AB Leishmania chagasi, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the Americas, has recently been associated with atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in Central America; however, little comprehensive information about this disease is available. Clinical, epidemiologic, and parasitologic characteristics of 252 ACL cases and 44 VL cases in Nicaragua were analyzed. Visceral leishmaniasis is primarily associated with malnourished children less than five years of age, whereas ACL is found predominantly in children greater than five years of age and young adults. Genetically similar parasites are associated with both disease manifestations. The sand fly Lutzomyia evansi, in addition to Lu. longipalpis, may be involved in transmission of L. chagasi to humans. Our results indicate that ACL is more prevalent than previously thought, affecting up to 10% of a local population. The fact that the same parasite appears to cause both ACL and the potentially fatal visceral disease suggests that the hope immune response is critical in determining the outcome of L. chagasi infection. The public health implications of the widespread presence of L. chagasi are discussed.

The patients used mainly opium, often in shooting galleries (50%). The prevalence of oral candidiasis (58%) and tester infection (20%) was high in HIV-seropositive patients, whereas oral hairy leukoplasia and Kaposi's sarcoma were absent. The prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was 24%. More than 80% of the patients had infections with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus, or human T cell lymphotropic virus type-1. The CD4+ cell counts correlated well with viral load. Only HIV-1 subtype E was detected in the 30 patients tested. A cohort study of HIV-infected subjects in this population seems feasible, and would permit introduction of anti-retroviral therapy The large number of HIV-seronegative subjects sharing the same at-risk practices as the HIV-infected subjects raises the possibility of natural protection in this population.

TI Reciprocal natural selection on host-parasite phenotypes
AB Coevolution is evolution in one species in response to selection imposed by a second species, followed by evolution in the second species in response to reciprocal selection imposed by the first species. Although reciprocal selection is a prerequisite of coevolution, it has seldom been documented in natural populations. We examined the feasibility of reciprocal selection in a simple host-parasite system consisting of feral pigeons (Columba livia) and their Ischnoceran feather lice (Phthiraptera: Insecta). We tested for a selective effect of parasites on hosts with experimentally altered defenses and for a selective effect of host defense on a component of parasite escape. Previous work indicates that pigeons control lice through efficient preening, while lice escape from preening using complex avoidance behavior. Our results show that feral pigeons with impaired preening, owing to slight bill deformities, have higher louse loads than pigeons with normal bills. We use a controlled experiment to show that high louse loads reduce the survival of pigeons, suggesting that lice select for efficient preening and against bill deformities. In a reciprocal experiment, we demonstrate that preening with a normal bill selects for small body size in lice, which may facilitate their escape From preening. The results of this study verify a crucial element of coevolutionary theory by identifying likely targets of reciprocal phenotypic selection between host and parasite.

TI The immunological function of allosuckling
AB Young mammals are unable to mount an efficient immune response against invading pathogens. Until their immune system is mature mothers transmit to their young immunological compounds during lactation. Given that genetic and foster mothers can assume this protective role, we propose that young mammals may gain immunological benefits by suckling more than one nursing female, a behaviour referred to as "allosuckling". This hypothesis has so far not been considered as a potential explanation for the propensity of young mammals to suckle foster mothers. However, pathogen transmission through milk during allosuckling may reduce the immunological net benefit that young gain, and furthermore allosuckling may increase pathogen transmission between foster and genetic mothers implying costs of allosuckling for all participants. Here, we develop the immunological function of allosuckling hypothesis (IFA) as a potential explanation for intra-and interspecific variation in allosuckling frequency. We present published experimental evidence for the assumption that immunological benefits of allosuckling depend on the immunological status of the offspring, the foster and the genetic mothers. Finally, we give predictions arising from the IFA hypothesis and propose that the IFA may provide a new explanation as to why neonates suckle various females and why foster females often refuse to nurse nonoffspring.

TI Constraints on the reproductive value of vertical transmission for a
   microsporidian parasite and its female-killing behaviour
AB 1. Several species of microsporidian parasites use a mixture of vertical and horizontal transmission among their respective mosquito host species. These relationships vary in how hosts are exploited for either vertical or horizontal transmission. An important factor is that only females can provide vertical transmission. Two types of relationship have particularly been contrasted; those where vertically infected larvae of both sexes are killed late in their development and contribute towards the parasite's horizontal transmission, and those where only male larvae are killed while females experience benign infections, become adults, and contribute towards the parasite's vertical transmission success. The selective killing of males in these latter relationships leads to female-biased adult sex ratios. These differences among relationships have been suggested to depend on the environmental conditions they experience and on the relative efficiency of vertical or horizontal transmission.
   2. The transmission behaviour of the microsporidian parasite Edhazardia aedis (Becnel, Fukuda & Sprague) following vertical transmission was studied as a function of larval food availability to its host, the mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.). The number of vertically infected mosquitoes dying before reaching adulthood increased as larval food availability became less. However, proportionately more females died as food availability decreased and adult mosquito populations became increasingly male-biased.
   3. The fate of vertically infected mosquitoes was closely related to their larval growth rate. As food availability decreased and larval growth rates slowed, the parasite's infection had more time to produce its spores and induce the host's mortality before emergence. This disproportionately affected female mosquitoes as they pupate later than males, especially as larval growth rates slow, AS late ages at pupation are associated with smaller adult size (approximate to lower fecundity), the potential vertical transmission offered by slowly growing female larvae is limited and more success may be gained by exploiting them for horizontal transmission.
   4. Our results indicate that the relative reproductive value of vertical or horizontal transmission altered with an ecological parameter (larval food availability), Constraints in the life-history traits of each organism helped to explain why the observed sex ratio was biased towards males rather than females.

TI Parasite local maladaptation in the Canarian lizard Gallotia galloti
   (Reptilia : Lacertidae) parasitized by haemogregarian blood parasite
AB Biologists commonly assume that parasites are locally adapted since they have shorter generation times and higher fecundity than their hosts, and therefore evolve faster in the arms race against the host's defences. As a result, parasites should be better able to infect hosts within their local population than hosts from other allopatric populations. However, recent mathematical modelling has demonstrated that when hosts have higher migration rates than parasites, hosts may diversify their genes faster than parasites and thus parasites may become locally maladapted. This new model was tested on the Canarian endemic lizard and its blood parasite (haemogregarine genus). In this host-parasite system, hosts migrate more than parasites since lizard offspring typically disperse from their natal site soon after hatching and without any contact with their parents who are potential carriers of the intermediate vector of the blood parasite (a mite). Results of cross-infection among three lizard populations showed that parasites were better at infecting individuals from allopatric populations than individuals from their sympatric population. This suggests that, in this host-parasite system, the parasites are locally maladapted to their host.

AB Epidemiologic studies link Kaposi's sarcoma with a sexually transmitted agent. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is likely to be that agent, but routes of transmission are poorly described. A seroepidemiologic study was conducted to determine whether HHV-8 is transmitted sexually between heterosexuals, Sera from 2718 patients attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic were tested for antibodies to HHV-8 and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), Information on sex partners in the previous 12 months and past STDs were obtained by questionnaire. Relationships between possible risk factors and HHV-8 infection were assessed by logistic regression. Overall, seroprevalence of HHV-8 was 7.3%. Independent risk factors for HHV-8 in the whole group were home/bisexuality and birth in Africa and, among homo/ bisexual men, a history of syphilis and HSV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity, Among heterosexuals there was no evidence for sexual transmission; the only independent risk factor for HHV-8 seropositivity was birth in Africa.

Of the respective 4266 cases, 46% were found in clusters of isolates with identical RFLPs, and 35% were attributed to active transmission. The clustering percentage increased strongly with the number of isolates; taking this into account, fewer cases were clustered than has been reported in other studies. Contact investigations in the five largest clusters of 23-47 patients suggested epidemiological linkage between cases, Of patients identified through contact tracing, 91% were clustered, Demographic risk factors for active transmission of tuberculosis included male sex, urban residence, Dutch and Surinamese nationality, and long-term residence in the Netherlands, Human immunodeficiency virus infection was not an independent risk factor for active transmission, Isoniazid-resistant strains were relatively less frequently clustered, suggesting that these generated fewer secondary cases.

However, to determine whether ALVAC-CMV(gB) could prime for antibody responses, 20 seronegative adults randomly received either 10(6.8) TCID50 of ALVAC-CMV(gB) or 10(6.8) TCID50 of ALVAC-RG, expressing the rabies glycoprotein, administered at 0 and 1 month, with all subjects receiving a dose of 10(3.5) pfu of the Towne vaccine at 90 days. For subjects primed with ALVAC-CMV(gB), neutralizing titers and ELISA antibodies to CMV(gB) developed sooner, were much higher, and persisted longer than for subjects primed with ALVAC-RG. All vaccines were well tolerated. These results demonstrate that ALVAC-CMV(gB) primes the immune system and suggest a combined-vaccine strategy to induce potentially protective levels of neutralizing antibodies.

TI Predicting variability in biological control of a plant-pathogen system
   using stochastic models
AB A stochastic model for the dynamics of a plant-pathogen interaction is developed and fitted to observations of the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani (Kuhn) in radish (Raphanus sativus L.), in both the presence and absence of the antagonistic fungus Trichoderma viride (Pers ex Gray). The model incorporates parameters for primary and secondary infection mechanisms and for characterizing the time-varying susceptibility of the host population. A parameter likelihood is developed and used to fit the model to data from microcosm experiments. It is shown that the stochastic model accounts well for observed variability both within and between treatments. Moreover, it enables us to describe the time evolution of the probability distribution for the variability among replicate epidemics in terms of the underlying epidemiological parameters for primary and secondary infection and decay in susceptibility. Consideration of profile likelihoods for each parameter provides strong evidence that T. viride mainly affects primary infection. By using the stochastic model to study the dependence of the probability distribution of disease levels on the primary infection rate we are therefore able to predict the effectiveness of a widely used biological control agent.

TI Cooperation and conflict in host-manipulating parasites
AB The existence of adaptive host manipulation by parasites has received increasing empirical support in recent years. Here I develop an optimality model of the extent of host manipulation, incorporating within-host group size, relatedness and a range of realistic cost-benefit functions. The model highlights the cooperative nature of host manipulation, and the potential for cheating this entails. When relatedness in parasite groups is minimal, manipulation is suppressed, but not eradicated, reflecting the importance of interhost selection. A distinctive threshold phenomenon is predicted for a wide range of parameter values. Below the group size threshold, manipulation is zero. Above the threshold, the predicted behaviour depends critically on the biological details of the individual-group interaction.
   The host-manipulation model is discussed in the light of two potential applications. If parasite group size is assumed to be a static characteristic of a parasite species or strain, the model generates a set of comparative predictions best suited to macroparasite systems. Additionally, the model can be used to predict density-dependent behavioural changes in expanding groups of parasites, as seen in quorum-sensing bacteria.

AB Over a 30-year period (1968-1997) 213 malaria cases in Trinidad were investigated by the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Health. Using a global positional system and a geographic information system, we mapped the precise location of all reported malaria cases, and associated them with breeding habitats of anopheline vectors. The majority of the cases (138, 63%) were individual imported cases around the big port cities. Plasmodium falciparum was the most common parasite, and Africa the most common source of imported cases. Two clusters of cases occurred: an introduced P. vivax outbreak associated with Anopheles aquasalis in 1990-1991, and an autochtonous focus of P. malariae associated with An. bellator and An. homunculus in 1994-1995. Application of a space-time statistic showed a significant clustering of P. malariae cases, and, to a lesser extent of P. vivax cases, but not of P. falciparum cases. Based on potential for occurrence of local transmission, we are developing risk maps to determine surveillance priorities, outbreak potential, and necessary degree and spatial range of control activities following case detections.

   Implications for transmission dynamics and human risk
AB Twenty-eight samples from humans and domestic and wild animals collected in Mexico between 1990 and 1995 were characterized by using anti-nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies and limited sequence analysis of the nucleoprotein gene. The variants of rabies viruses identified in these samples were compared with other isolates from Mexico and the rest of the Americas to establish epidemiologic links between cases and outbreaks and to increase the understanding of rabies epidemiology in the Western Hemisphere. Antigenic and genetic diversity was found in all samples from dogs and dog-related cases, suggesting a long-term endemic situation with multiple, independent cycles of virus transmission. Two isolates from bobcats were antigenically and genetically homologous to the rabies variant circulating in the Arizona gray fox population, indicating a wider distribution of this variant than previously reported. Rabies isolates from skunks were unrelated to any variant analyzed in this study and represent a previously unrecognized cycle of rabies transmission in skunks in Baja California Sur. Two antigenic and genetic variants cocirculating in southern and eastern Mexico were found in viruses obtained from cases epidemiologically related to vampire bats. These results serve as a baseline for the better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of rabies in Mexico.

TI A new marker, black, a useful recombination suppressor, in(2)2, and a
   balanced lethal for chromosome 2 of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae
AB A new marker for the second chromosome of Anopheles gambiae, black, was isolated from progeny of Co-60-irradiated mosquitoes. The black mutation increases melanization of larval setae and portions of the cuticle that are heavily sclerotized such as the saddle and head capsule. Adults have a sooty color that almost completely eliminates white banding on wings, tarsi, and palps. Fertility and general vigor of black individuals is reduced relative to wild-type; however, this does not prevent routine use for genetic crossing. The black marker was mapped to an interval on chromosome 2 between collarless and Dieldrin resistance 22 centiMorgans (cM) from collarless and 39 cM from Dieldrin resistance. We also isolated from Co-60-irradiated mosquitoes a pericentric inversion, In(2)2, that was marked with dominant alleles of the independently assorting genes collarless and Dieldrin resistance. This inversion is in coupling with the pericentric inversion 2Rd and covers approximately two-thirds of chromosome 2 from divisions 9 to 22. While inbreeding ln(2)2 heterozygotes, we isolated a stock in which the inversion was in repulsion to a chromosome marked with c b Dl(S) and an unidentified recessive lethal. This arrangement produced a useful and stable chromosome 2 balancer system that has remained intact for 26 generations without selection. These genetic tools will reduce the effort requires to isolate, among other things, the genetic factors affecting malaria parasite interactions with the mosquito host.

Previous surveys conducted in the same area showed obvious interethnic differences in the susceptibility and immune reactivity to malaria, with the Fulani showing lower infection and disease rates and higher humoral responses to various P. falciparum antigens than sympatric ethnic groups. A total of 764 subjects (311 Mossi, 273 Rimaibe, and 180 Fulani) of all age classes were tested. The total mean +/- SE anti-(CSPf-N-term) and anti-(CSPf-C-term) seroprevalences were 65.6 +/- 1.7% and 57.0 +/- 1.8%, respectively. These seroprevalences were lower than that recorded in the same sample for the central (NANP)(40) repetitive domain (88.3 +/- 1.2%). As previously reported for other P. falciparum antigens (PfCSP(NANP),, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein, merozoite surface protein-1, Pf155-ring-infected eryhtrocyte surface antigen, and Pf332), in spite of similar exposure to malaria, the Fulani showed higher immune reactivity than sympatric populations for both antigens tested. Our results confirm the presence of B cell epitopes in the non-repetitive regions of the PfCSP; moreover a further evidence of interethnic differences in the capacity to mount humoral responses against P. falciparum malaria was obtained. The assessment of the biological basis of interethnic heterogeneities in the susceptibility and in the humoral immune responses to malaria appears relevant in the development of anti-malaria vaccines.

TI The red queen and fluctuating epistasis: A population genetic analysis
   of antagonistic coevolution
AB Host-parasite coevolution has been shown to provide an advantage to recombination, but the selective mechanism underlying this advantage is unclear. One possibility is that recombination increases the frequency of advantageous genotypes that are disproportionately rare because of fluctuating epistasis. However, for this mechanism to work, epistasis for fitness must fluctuate over a very narrow timescale: two to five generations. Alternatively, recombination may speed up the response to directional selection by breaking up linkage disequilibria that decrease additive genetic variance. Here we analyze the results of a numerical simulation of host-parasite coevolution to assess the importance of these two mechanisms. We find that linkage disequilibria may tend to increase, rather than decrease, additive genetic variance. In addition, the sign of epistasis changes every two to five generations under several of the parameter values investigated, and epistasis and linkage disequilibrium are frequently of opposite signs. These results are consistent with the idea that selection for recombination is mediated by fluctuating epistasis. Finally, we explore the conditions under which an allele causing free recombination can spread in a nonrecombining host population and find general agreement between the predictions of a population genetic model of fluctuating epistasis and our simulation model.

TI Pathogen reverses competition between larval amphibians
AB Ecologists have often suggested that the presence of pathogens that differentially affect interacting species may affect the outcome of interactions, yet few experimental studies have documented pathogen-mediated interactions using a natural host-parasite system. We studied the effects of a pathogenic water mold, Saprolegnia ferax, on competitive interactions between the Cascades frog Rana cascadae and the Pacific treefrog Hyla regilla. Previous studies have shown that outbreaks of Saprolegnia infection in the Cascade mountains of Oregon, USA, result in high embryonic mortality for Rana but not for Hyla. Thus, we examined how infections of Saprolegnia during amphibian embryonic development could influence larval recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Rana and Hyla. We manipulated the presence of Saprolegnia and embryonic Hyla and Rana in replicated artificial ponds and determined mean survivorship to hatching per pool from daily observations during embryonic development. Pools were then followed throughout larval development, and we recorded mean mass of tadpoles at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis per pool. The presence of Saprolegnia differentially affected larval recruitment of the two species; larval recruitment of Rana was reduced by 46.2% in the presence of Saprolegnia, whereas Hyla survival was not affected. However, larval Rana that survived Saprolegnia infection developed faster and were larger at metamorphosis compared to individuals not exposed to Saprolegnia. In the absence of Saprolegnia, Rana had strong negative effects on the growth, development, and survival of Hyla. However, in the presence of Saprolegnia, the outcome of competitive interactions between the two species was reversed. Saprolegnia may have positive indirect effects on both Hyla and Rana by regulating both intra- and interspecific competition. These results suggest that pathogens can have strong effects on species interactions and may ultimately influence community structure.

AB A two-dose mass vaccination programme with a combined vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) was adopted in the Netherlands in 1987, replacing the selective schoolgirl vaccination strategy introduced in 1974. To obtain insight into the effect of mass vaccination and the population's immunity, the antibody levels against rubella were studied in the general Dutch population and in religious groups refusing vaccination. In the national sample, we observed a high prevalence (96.5%) for rubella antibodies in vaccinated cohorts as well as in the older unvaccinated cohorts. No indications of rapidly waning immunity after vaccination were found. There are indications of low virus circulation in the last few years. The Very high seroprevalence in women at childbearing age is consistent with the few reported cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) at present. However, individuals in the age group of 1-9 years who are not vaccinated for religious or other reasons have a considerably lower seroprevalence and thus there is a potential risk of a CRS outbreak in the future.

TI Phylogeographic patterns exhibited by Ontario rabies virus variants
AB A previous study on N gene variation of rabies viruses circulating in Ontario red foxes identified four viral variants. This study confirms the geographical localization of these variants and extends the analysis to the less conserved G gene of these viruses. A greater number of regionally localized variants was revealed and their phylogenetic relationships have been examined. Ongoing surveillance on recent disease outbreaks revealed that variants do not always persist in specific areas. The distribution of these variants did however appear to be influenced by topographical features of the study area likely to affect host animal movements and contacts. The majority of G gene base changes were synonymous and limited glycoprotein sequence variation predominantly to the C-terminal transmembrane and endo-domains. These data are most readily explained by random appearance of genetic viral variants followed by their spread throughout sub-populations of the fox host according to the easiest routes of transmission.

TI Chemokine receptor polymorphisms and human immunodeficiency virus
   disease progression
AB The role of polymorphisms in genes encoding chemokines and their receptors (CCR2B, SDF-1, and the promoter region of CCR5) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression was studied in 132 white HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected participants from a United Kingdom cohort study. Genotyping was done by use of amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the impact of polymorphisms on time to a CD4 cell count <200 x 10(6)/L and to CDC stage IV disease, The results confirm a significant association Of the CCR2B-64I mutant genotype with slower progression to a CD4 count <200 (hazards ratio [HR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.91) but not with the SDF-1 alpha 3'UTR homozygous mutation. The effects of the CCR5 and CCR2 mutations were genetically independent and similar in the magnitude of their protective effect on progression to a CD4 count <200 cells. A novel finding was an association of borderline significance between homozygosity for C at nucleotide position 59353 in the CCR5 promoter region and a slower rate of CD4 cell decline to <200 X 10(6)/L (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34-0.996).

   Uganda for detection of human papillomavirus
AB A random sample of 960 women aged 15-59 years enrolled in a population-based study in rural Uganda were asked to provide self-collected vaginal swabs for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing by hybrid capture assay. The intensity of HPV infection was assessed by the relative light unit (RLU) ratio in the specimen-to-positive control (PC) ratio. In total, 898 women (93%) provided a swab and 737 provided serum for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) determination, HPV prevalence was 16.7% and was highest in younger women. HIV-1 prevalence was 17.8%. HPV prevalence was 44.3% in HIV-positive and 10.2% in HIV-negative women (rate ratio, 5.36; 95% confidence interval, 3.81-7.54). The intensity of HPV infection was significantly greater among HIV-positive than HIV-negative women (54.4 vs. 11.1 RLU/PC; P = .026); intensity of infection was highest in women aged <30 years. The higher prevalence and intensity of HPV infection in HIV-positive women could facilitate HPV transmission in this population, Self-collected vaginal swabs could be used in population-based screening to identify women at high risk of cervical neoplasia.

TI A phylogeographical analysis of the Bemisia tabaci species complex based
   on mitochondrial DNA markers
AB Mitochondrial 16S (similar to 550 bp) and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) (similar to 700 bp) sequences were utilized as markers to reconstruct a phylogeography for representative populations or biotypes of Bemisia tabaci. 16S sequences exhibited less divergence than COI sequences. Of the 429 characters examined for COI sequences, 185 sites were invariant, 244 were variable and 108 were informative. COI sequence identities yielded distances ranging from less than 1% to greater than 17%. Whitefly 16S sequences of 456 characters were analysed which consisted of 298 invariant sites, 158 variable sites and 53 informative sites. Phylogenetic analyses conducted by maximum parsimony, maximum-likelihood and neighbour-joining methods yielded almost identical phylogenetic reconstructions of trees that separated whiteflies based on geographical origin. The 16S and COI sequence data indicate that the B-biotype originated in the Old World (Europe, Asia and Africa) and is most closely related to B-like variants from Israel and Yemen, with the next closest relative being a biotype from Sudan. These data confirm the biochemical, genetic and behavioural polymorphisms described previously for B. tabaci. The consideration of all global variants of B. tabaci as a highly cryptic group of sibling species is argued.

TI 'Small worlds' and the evolution of virulence: infection occurs locally
   and at a distance
AB Why are some diseases more virulent than others? Vector-borne diseases such as malaria and water-borne diseases such as cholera are generally more virulent than diseases spread by direct contagion. One factor that characterizes both vector- and water-borne diseases is their ability to spread over long distances, thus causing infection of susceptible individuals distant from the infected individual. Here we show that this ability of the pathogen to infect distant individuals in a spatially structured host population leads to the evolution of a more virulent pathogen. We use a lattice model in which reproduction is local but infection can vary between completely local to completely global. With completely global infection the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the same as in mean-field models while a lower virulence is predicted as infection becomes more local. There is characteristically a period of relatively moderate increase in virulence followed by a more rapid rise with increasing proportions of global infection as we move beyond a 'critical connectivity'. In the light of recent work emphasizing the existence of 'small world' networks in human populations, our results suggests that if the world is getting 'smaller'-as populations become more connected-diseases may evolve higher virulence.

TI Transmission dynamics of a zoonotic pathogen within and between wildlife
   host species
AB The transmission dynamics of the cowpox virus infection have been quantified in two mixed populations of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), through analyses of detailed time-series of the numbers of susceptible, infectious and newly infected individuals. The cowpox virus is a zoonosis which circulates in these rodent hosts and has been shown to have an adverse effect on reproductive output. The transmission dynamics within species is best described as frequency dependent rather than density dependent, contrary to the 'mass action' assumption of most previous studies, both theoretical and empirical. Estimation of a transmission coefficient for each species in each population also allows annual and seasonal variations in transmission dynamics to be investigated through an analysis of regression residuals. Transmission between host species is found to be negligible despite their close cohabitation. The consequences of this for the combining ability of hosts as zoonotic reservoirs, and for apparent competition between hosts, are discussed.

TI Viruses of the Serengeti: patterns of infection and mortality in African
   lions
AB 1. We present data on the temporal dynamics of six viruses that infect lions (Panthera lee) in the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, These populations have been studied continuously for the past 30 years, and previous research has documented their seroprevalence for feline herpesvirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus and canine distemper virus (CDV), A seventh virus, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), was absent from these animals,
   2. Comprehensive analysis reveals that feline herpesvirus and FIV were consistently prevalent at high levels, indicating that they were endemic in the host populations. Feline calici-, parvo- and coronavirus, and CDV repeatedly showed a pattern of seroprevalence that was indicative of discrete disease epidemics: a brief period of high exposure for each virus was followed by declining seroprevalence.
   3. The timing of viral invasion suggests that different epidemic viruses are associated with different minimum threshold densities of susceptible hosts, Furthermore, the proportion of susceptibles that became infected during disease outbreaks was positively correlated with the number of susceptible hosts at the beginning of each outbreak.
   4. Examination of the relationship between disease outbreaks and host fitness suggest that these viruses do not affect birth and death rates in lions, with the exception of the 1994 outbreak of canine distemper virus. Although the endemic viruses (FHV and FIV) were too prevalent to measure precise health effects, there was no evidence that FIV infection reduced host longevity.

At enrollment, 260 (40%) of 650 sexually active females ages 14-19 years had an STD: chlamydia, 27%; herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), 14%; gonorrhea, 6%; trichomoniasis, 3%; and hepatitis B, 2%. At follow-up, 112 (23%) of 501 participants had an incident infection: chlamydia, 18%; HSV-2, 4%; gonorrhea, 4%; and trichomoniasis, 3%. At either enrollment or follow-up, 53% had greater than or equal to 1 STD; of those with 1 lifetime partner, 30% had an STD, Having a new partner (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.2) or friends who sell cocaine (OR, 1.6; CI, 1.0-2.6) was independently associated with incident infection. STD incidence and prevalence were extremely high in this population, even in teenagers with only 1 lifetime partner. Individual risk behaviors appeared less important for STD risk than population factors.

TI Transmissibility and persistence of oral polio vaccine viruses:
   Implications for the global poliomyelitis eradication initiative
AB The global poliomyelitis eradication initiative has been a tremendous success, with current evidence suggesting that wild poliovirus will cease to circulate anywhere in the world soon after the year 2000. As the goal of wild poliovirus eradication is approached, concern has been raised about the potential for persistent transmission of oral polio vaccine (OPV) viruses, as these viruses are known to revert toward wild-type neurovirulence. This paper has been extracted from a document prepared for the World Health Organization on the implications of OPV transmissibility for the strategy of stopping OPV vaccination after global eradication of wild polioviruses. The authors review the empirical evidence on OPV transmissibility available from household and community transmission studies and from mass-vaccination experiences. They then consider theoretical measures of transmissibility and persistence for wild and OPV viruses (secondary attack rate, basic reproduction number, and critical populations' size), to assess whether transmissibility of OPV viruses is sufficient to allow persistence of these viruses after cessation of vaccination. The findings indicate that OPV viruses could persist under various plausible circumstances, and that this potential should be a major consideration when planning the cessation of OPV vaccination.

TI Modeling the impact of subclinical measles transmission in vaccinated
   populations with waning immunity
AB An increasing body of evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of individuals who respond to measles vaccine display an antibody boost accompanied by mild or no symptoms on exposure to wild virus. It is unknown whether this emerging class of individuals can support transmission. The epidemiologic consequences of vaccinated individuals able to transmit virus are investigated using a mathematical model. Parameters for this model are estimated using regression analysis on a Canadian serologic data set. The authors confirm that neutralizing antibodies are decaying significantly in absence of circulating virus. Based on a protective threshold plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) titer of 120, the authors estimate the mean duration of vaccine-induced protection in absence of reexposure to be 25 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 18, 48). After long-term absence of circulating virus, the mathematical model predicts that 80% (95% CI 65, 91) of all seroconverted vaccinees have titers below the protective threshold. In this case, elimination of measles virus cannot be achieved by a single-dose routine vaccination strategy if the basic reproduction number in vaccinated individuals exceeds 1.24 (95% CI 1.10, 1.53). For this reason, there is a need to establish the intensity and duration of infectiousness in vaccinated individuals.

TI Measles epidemic in Romania, 1996-1998: Assessment of vaccine
   effectiveness by case-control and cohort studies
AB A measles epidemic occurred in Romania with 32,915 cases and 21 deaths reported between November 1996 and June 1998, despite high vaccination coverage since the early 1980s. Most cases were unvaccinated children aged <2 years and vaccinated school-aged children. A case-control study among preschool children and a cohort study among primary-school children were conducted to estimate effectiveness of Romanian-produced measles vaccine, and to evaluate age at Vaccination and waning immunity as risk factors for vaccine failure. Both studies indicated that measles vaccine was highly effective. One dose reduced the risk for measles by 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 85, 91); two doses reduced the risk by 96% (95% CI 92, 98). Children vaccinated at cl year of age were not at increased risk for measles compared with children vaccinated at greater than or equal to 1 year. Waning immunity was not identified as a risk factor since Vaccine effectiveness was similar for children vaccinated 6-8, 9-11, and 12-14 years in the past. Because specific groups were not at risk for vaccine failure, an immunization campaign that targets all school-aged children who lack two doses may be an effective strategy for preventing outbreaks. A mass campaign followed by increased first-dose coverage should provide the population immunity required to interrupt indigenous measles virus transmission in Romania.

TI Plasmodium falciparum parasites in French Guiana: limited genetic
   diversity and high selfing rate
AB The genetic characteristics of Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected in French Guiana, where malaria transmission is low and occurs in isolated foci, were studied. Blood samples were collected from 142 patients with symptomatic malaria and typed using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy for merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) block 2, the MSP-2 central domain, and glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) repeat domain polymorphism. This showed that the parasite population circulating in French Guiana presented a limited number of allelic forms (4, 2, and 3 for MSP-1 block 2, MSP-1, and GLURP, respectively) and a small number of mixed infections, contrasting with the large genetic diversity of parasite populations and infection complexity reported for Africa, Asia, and other parts of South America. Two groups of isolates displaying identical 3 loci allele combinations were further studied for the Pf332 antigen, histidine-rich protein-1, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein, and Pf60 multigene family polymorphism. Within each group, most isolates were identical for all markers tested. This suggests a high rate of self-fertilization of P. falciparum parasites in French Guiana, resulting in homogenization of the population. The implications of these findings for malaria control in areas of low endemicity are discussed.

   studies of the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue viruses
AB We report the isolation of microsatellites from an enriched library of genomic repeated sequences, using a biotin-labeled oligonucleotide bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic particles. Four microsatellites were obtained from a partial library of 120 recombinant clones. This more efficient and rapid method to obtain these specific repeated sequences is preferred to the conventional isolation procedure based on the construction of a genomic library. Microsatellite markers would be promising molecular tools for the study of genetic variability of mosquito populations. Analyses of genetic structure and gene flow would provide information on the distance, direction and rate of dispersal of genes in Aedes aegypti populations. Knowledge on gene dispersal patterns is required to develop vector control strategies.

   Pakistan: infection by injections from health care providers
AB Household members of people with hepatitis C are at increased risk of HCV infection. The prevalence and routes of transmission of HCV to household members in Hafizabad, Pakistan were investigated. Household members of 24 index cases were given a risk factor questionnaire, tested for HCV infection, and the risk factors between the infected and uninfected were compared. Twelve of 74 household members (16.2 %) were seropositive for HCV antibody. This was 21/2 times the rate of infection in the general population (OR = 2.8; P = 0.01). None of the routes of transmission studied within the household was associated with an increased risk. Household members who received more than 4 injections per year were 11.9 times more likely to be infected than those who had not (P = 0.016). In Hafizabad, the greatest risk for HCV infection to household members of infected people is injections given by health-care workers rather than household contact with infected persons.

TI Invasion thresholds for fungicide resistance: deterministic and
   stochastic analyses
AB Fungicide resistance is an important practical problem, but one that is poorly understood at the population level. Here we introduce a simple nonlinear model for fungicide resistance in botanical epidemics which includes the dynamics of the chemical control agent and the host population, while also allowing for demographic stochasticity in the host-parasite dynamics. This provides a mathematical framework for analysing the risk of fungicide resistance developing by including the parameters for the amount applied, longevity and application frequency of the fungicide. The model demonstrates the existence of thresholds for the invasion of the resistant strain in the parasite population which depend on two quantities: the relative fitness of the resistant strain and the effectiveness of control. This threshold marks a change from definite elimination of the resistant strain below the threshold to a finite probability of invasion which increases above the threshold. The fungicide decay rate, the amount of fungicide applied and the period between applications affect the effectiveness of control and, consequently, they influence whether or not resistance develops and the time taken to achieve a critical frequency of resistance. All three parameters are amenable to control by the grower or by coordinating the activity of a population of growers. Providing crude estimates of the effectiveness of control and relative fitness are available, the results can be used to predict the consequences of changing these parameters for the risk of invasion and the proportion of sites at which this might be expected to occur. Although motivated for fungicide resistance, the model has broader application to herbicide, antibiotic and antiviral resistance. The modelling approach and results are discussed in the contest of resistance to chemical control in general.

AB The geographic distribution of Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite protein phenotypes from patient blued used to infect colonized Anopheles albimanus and An. pseudopunctipennis was investigated in southern Mexico. Parasite phenotype types were determined in blood samples by a polymerase chain reaction and oligoprobe hybridization or by immunofluorescent assay of sporozoites. The proportion of infected mosquitoes and the number of oocysts per mosquito confirmed previous in vitro observations indicating that Ail. albimanus is more susceptible to VK210 and that An. pseudopunctipennis is more susceptible to VK247. All patients living on the coast were infected with VK210 and most patients living above 170 meters above sea level had VK247. Both phenotypes infected patients from intermediate altitudes. These results concur with the distribution of the anophelines, indicating that An. albimanus is the main vector of the phenotype VK210, but that Ail. pseudopunctipennis transmits both phenotypes. These conditions have direct implications on parasite transmission rates and malaria epidemiology in Mexico.

In the subgroup of women who were not pregnant and not using hormonal contraception (n = 178), serum vitamin A was highly predictive of cervical HSV shedding: concentrations indicating severe deficiency, moderate deficiency, low-normal, and high-normal status were associated with 29%, 18%, 8%, and 2% prevalences of cervical HSV shedding, respectively (linear trend, P = .0002), Several factors appear to influence HSV reactivation in HIV-1 seropositive women.

Neutrophils are crucial leukocytes in the first line of host defense against bacterial infections. To investigate the role of complement in the Borrelia-induced activation of human neutrophils, oxidative burst, calcium mobilization, and phagocytosis induced by three subspecies of B. burgdorferi were studied. Each subspecies induced all observed neutrophil functions in a complement-dependent manner. Serum-derived factors bound to the surface of B, burgdorferi were found to be essential for the induction of the oxidative burst. The CD11b chain of CR3 was found to participate in the oxidative burst and calcium mobilization induced by B. burgdorferi.

   cells induced by in vitro infection with respiratory syncytial virus
AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major cause of morbidity in children, results in severe lower respiratory tract infections. With an in vitro infection system of isolated cord or adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells, addition of virus to cell cultures resulted in significant reductions in cell deaths, as measured by 2 independent assays: quantitation of cells with subdiploid levels of DNA and cells with DNA strand breaks. Decreased cell death was observed in lymphocytes and monocytes of cord and adult samples, with more dramatic effects evident in cells from cord blood. This may be linked to the increased virulence observed in infants with RSV infection. These data suggest that RSV may be equipped with some mechanism to prevent apoptosis, which is a major component of the host defense system used to eliminate virally infected cells.

TI Molecular evidence for multiple infections of a new subgroup of
   Wolbachia in the European raspberry beetle Byturus tomentosus
AB Wolbachia, a group of maternally inherited intracellular parasitic bacteria, alter host reproduction, including the induction of thelytokous parthenogenesis, feminization of genetic males, son killing and, most commonly the induction of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), in a diverse array of arthropods. CI can result in infertility and has attracted attention because of its potential in biological control and as an agent in speciation. Although there has been some analysis of overall infection rates in arthropods and within individual insect orders, there has been little exploration of within-species variation. In this study, primers specific for the ftsZ gene of Wolbachia were used to amplify it from different geographical samples of the European raspberry beetle (Byturus tomentosus), confirming the presence of Wolbachia. More than 99% of UK individuals were found to be infected with Wolbachia and 97% of these B. tomentosus beetles harboured multiple infections. Preliminary analysis of B. tomentosus beetles from continental European populations revealed a lower level of infection (24%) than those from the UK. Phylogenetic analysis using the ftsZ DNA sequences places Wolbachia from B. tomentosus into a new clade (Abt) within the A division, with some revisions to the existing Wolbachia phylogeny.

TI Sex-ratio-distorting Wolbachia causes sex-role reversal in its butterfly
   host
AB Sex-role-reversed mating systems in which females compete for males and males may be choosy are usually associated with males investing more than females in offspring. We report that sex-role reversal may also be caused by selfish genetic elements which distort the sex ratio towards females. Some populations of the butterflies Acraea encedon and Acraea encedana are extremely female biased because over 90% of females are infected with a Wolbachia bacterium that is maternally inherited and kills male embryos. Many females in these populations are virgins suggesting that their reproductive success may be limited by access to males. These females form lekking swarms at landmarks in which females exhibit behaviours which we interpret as functioning to solicit matings from males. The hypothesis that female A. encedon swarm in order to mate is supported by the finding that, in release-recapture experiments, mated females tend to leave the swarm while unmated females remained. This behaviour is a sex-role-reversed form of a common mating system in insects in which males form lekking swarms at landmarks and compete for females. Female lekking swarms are absent from less female-biased populations and here the butterflies are instead associated with resources in the form of the larval food plant.

A baseline survey was conducted for 981 males and 2,078 females in June 1992 and evaluated hepatitis B surface antigen, second-generation hepatitis C virus antibody, and history of cigarette smoking and habitual alcohol consumption. By March 1997, 14 males and 8 females had been newly diagnosed with HCC. After controlling for gender and age by using the Cox model, the authors found that positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen (hazard ratio = 7.28, 95% confidence interval: 1,62, 32.61; p < 0.01) and positivity for high-titer hepatitis C virus antibody (hazard ratio = 40,38, 95% confidence interval: 11.71, 139.21; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with HCC risk, although a history of smoking or alcohol consumption was not significantly related to risk, There was a significant interaction on an additive scale for the risk of HCC development between high-titer hepatitis C virus antibody status and a history of smoking (p < 0.05) in spite of no significant interaction on a multiplicative scale. Although preventing the transmission of hepatitis viruses is most important for reducing the risk of HCC, intervention regarding lifestyle habits such as cigarette smoking should not go unheeded.

   wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1
AB Various forms of nef genes with deletions at conserved positions along the sequence have been reported to persist in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infected patients. We investigate the forces maintaining such variants in the proviral population. The main selection pressures are preservation of function and host immune response. The crippled Nef protein might have fewer epitopes, and as such be less visible to the specific immune response, but it will lose some function. Does a trade-off between avoidance of the immune response and loss of function explain the dynamics of the crippled virus found in the patients' To answer this question, we formulated a deterministic model of the virus-host interactions. We found that when the crippled protein presents few epitopes and suffers little loss of function, the two viral types can coexist. Otherwise, the wild-type comes to prevail. The mutant form might initially dominate, but as the selective pressure by the CD8+ T cells decreases over the course of infection, the advantage for the crippled form of losing epitopes disappears. Hence, we go from a situation of coexistence of wild-type and mutant, to a situation of only full-length nef. The results are discussed in the context of the suggested use of live attenuated vaccines having deletions in nef.

TI Genetic distances for the study of infectious disease epidemiology
AB Molecular epidemiologic studies of infectious pathogens 1) generate genetic patterns from a collection of microorganisms, 2) compare the degree of similarity among these patterns, and 3) infer from these similarities infectious disease transmission patterns. The authors propose a quantitative approach using genetic distances to study the degree of similarity between patterns. Benefits of such genetic distance calculations are illustrated by an analysis of standard DNA fingerprints of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in San Francisco collected during the period 1991-1997. Graphical representation of genetic distances can assist in determining if the disappearance of a specific pattern in a community is due to interruption of transmission or ongoing evolution of the microorganism's fingerprint. Genetic distances can also compensate for varying information content derived by DNA fingerprints of contrasting pattern complexity. To study demographic and clinical correlates of transmission, the authors calculated the smallest genetic distance from each patient sample to all other samples. With correlation of genetic distances and nearest genetic distances with previously understood notions of the epidemiology of M, tuberculosis in San Francisco, factors influencing transmission are investigated.

TI Aedes aegypti in Tahiti and Moorea (French Polynesia): Isoenzyme
   differentiation in the mosquito population according to human population
   density
AB Genetic differences at five polymorphic isoenzyme loci were analyzed by starch gel electrophoresis for 28 Aedes aegypti samples. Considerable (i.e., high F-st values) and significant (i.e., P values >10(-4)) geographic differences were found. Differences in Ae. aegypti genetic structure were related to human population densities and to particularities in mosquito ecotopes in both Tahiti and Moorea islands. In highly urbanized areas (i.e., the Papeete agglomeration), mosquitoes were highly structured. Recurrent extinction events consecutive to insecticidal treatments during dengue outbreaks tend to differentiate mosquito populations. In less populated zones (i.e., the east coast of Moorea and Tahiti), differences in ecotope characteristics could explain the lack of differentiation among mosquitoes from rural environments such as the east coast of Tahiti where natural breeding sites predominate. When the lowest populated zones such as Tahiti Iti and the west coast of Moorea are compared, mosquito are less differentiated in Moorea. These results will be discussed in relation to the recent findings of variation in mosquito infection rates for dengue-2 virus.

TI First field evidence for natural vertical transmission of West Nile
   virus in Culex univittatus complex mosquitoes from Rift Valley Province,
   Kenya
AB West Nile virus is a mosquito borne flavivirus endemic over a large geographic area including Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Although the virus generally causes a mild, self-limiting febrile illness in humans, it has sporadically caused central nervous system infections during epidemics. An isolate of West Nile virus was obtained from a pool of four male Culex univittatus complex mosquitoes while we were conducting an investigation of Rift Valley fever along the Kenya-Uganda border in February-March 1998. This represents the first field isolation of West Nile virus from male mosquitoes and strongly suggests that vertical transmission of the virus occurs in the primary maintenance mosquito vector in Kenya. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete amino acid sequence of the viral envelope glycoprotein demonstrated a sister relationship with a Culex pipiens mosquito isolate from Romania made in 1996, This unexpected finding probably reflects the role of migratory birds in disseminating West Nile virus between Africa and Europe.

TI Inbreeding effects on resistance and transmission-related traits in the
   Silene-Microbotryum pathosystem
AB Inbreeding in local host populations will be a common phenomenon in host-pathogen systems that are characterized by metapopulation dynamics, i.e., frequent extinction and recolonization of local host populations by small numbers of founding individuals. As an example of a pathosystem with metapopulation dynamics we investigated the impact of inbreeding in the host plant Silene alba on its interaction with the anther-smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum. Seeds from eight populations of S. alba were sampled, and five generations of sib mating resulted in 65 inbred lines, with inbreeding coefficients of f = 0, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, and 0.59 per line. In a first experiment these lines were tested for active, biochemical resistance against fungal infection, by artificially inoculating individuals. The percentage of infected individuals differed significantly among populations, lines, and inbreeding levels, and both population-by-inbreeding level and line-by-inbreeding level interactions were significant. The most striking result was the strong variance in inbreeding effects among lines; inbreeding resulted in increased resistance in some lines and decreased resistance in others. In a second experiment for 12 inbred lines, originating from one population, active resistance and Rower traits associated with passive resistance (avoidance) to this insect-vectored, florally transmitted disease were measured. Significant inbreeding depression was demonstrated for petal size and nectar volume. Thus inbreeding might enhance avoidance of spore transmission by insects. For both active resistance and all flower traits, significant line-by-inbreeding level interactions were found. The results indicate that the effect of inbreeding on the interaction between host and pathogen in this pathosystem is unpredictable at the local population level, because: (1) strong genotypic differences in inbreeding effect exist for both active and passive resistance, making the effect of inbreeding at the population level dependent on the genotypic composition of the (founder) population (2) effects of inbreeding on active and passive resistance were not correlated, making the net effect of inbreeding on field resistance unpredictable: and (3) in several lines, evidence for epistatic effects was round, making the effect of inbreeding dependent on the actual inbreeding level of the genotype. The results underscore that most progress in the study of host-path from an integrated ecological and genetic approach.

TI Evolutionary dynamics of pathogen resistance and tolerance
AB Host organisms can respond to the threat of disease either through resistance defenses (which inhibit or limit infection) or through tolerance strategies (which do not limit infection, but reduce or offset its fitness consequences). Here we show that resistance and tolerance can have fundamentally different evolutionary outcomes, even when they have equivalent short-term benefit for the host. As a gene conferring disease resistance spreads through a population, the incidence of infection declines, reducing the fitness advantage of carrying the resistance gene. Thus genes conferring complete resistance cannot become fixed (i.e., universal) by selection in a host population, and diseases cannot be eliminated solely by natural selection for host resistance. By contrast, as a gene conferring disease tolerance spreads through a population, disease incidence rises, increasing the evolutionary advantage of carrying the tolerance gene. Therefore, any tolerance gene that can invade a host population will tend to be driven to fixation by selection. As predicted, field studies of diverse plant species infected by rust fungi confirm that resistance traits tend to be polymorphic and tolerance traits tend to be fixed. These observations suggest a new mechanism for the evolution of mutualism from parasitism, and they help to explain the ubiquity of disease.

TI Evolution of virulence in a heterogeneous host population
AB There is a large body of theoretical studies that investigate factors that affect the evolution of virulence, that is parasite-induced host mortality. In these studies the host population is assumed to be genetically homogeneous. However, many parasites have a broad range of host types they infect, and trade-offs between the parasite virulence in different host types may exist. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of host heterogeneity on the evolution of parasite virulence. By analyzing a simple model that describes the replication of different parasite strains in a population of two different host types, we determine the optimal level of virulence in both host types and find the conditions under which strains that specialize in one host type dominate the parasite population. Furthermore, we show that intrahost evolution of the parasite during an infection may lead to stable polymorphisms and could introduce evolutionary branching in the parasite population.

TI Effects of surgically imposed sterility on free-ranging rabbit
   populations
AB 1. Demographic changes in response to surgically imposed female sterility were monitored in 12 free-ranging rabbit populations in south-western Australia over a 4-year period. This was part of a research programme aimed at examining the potential for virally vectored immunocontraception to limit the abundance of rabbits (e.g. using a recombinant myxoma virus) and other mammalian pests. Sterility levels were 0%, 40%, 60% and 80% of all females in year 1, with a similar proportion of female recruits sterilized surgically in subsequent years.
   2. There was a significant decrease in rabbit productivity with increasing sterility level. This was overcome by increased survival of kittens and adults on the high-sterility sites, such that the base-level numbers of rabbits were maintained, and mean annual rates of increase (r) were near zero for all treatments in all years. However, in the high-sterility populations this compensation was insufficient to overcome the effects of sterility totally, and there was a marked decrease in the seasonal peaks in rabbit abundance for these treatments.
   3. Survival and recruitment were dependent upon the level of sterility, and consequently the density of rabbits, with greatest survival of adult rabbits occurring on the 80% sites. Survival of sterile females was greater than that of other adults, probably because of their increased ability to maintain body condition during times of low pasture biomass (summer drought). Thus two density-dependent processes were identified: the first was operating through increased survival of juvenile rabbits, the second through increased adult survival, particularly sterilized females.
   4. Because the proportional impact of immigration was greater (i.e. immigrants constituted a greater proportion of the population) and emigration was less, from the 80% sites, the effects of sterility may have been underestimated on these sites.
   5. The abundance of European rabbit fleas, a vector of myxomatosis, was significantly lower on the 80% sites, but this did not appear to affect the transmission of myxoma. Myxomatosis occurred as an annual epizootic in three of four years, with > 90% of rabbits on site after each epizootic testing positive for myxoma antibodies.
   6. To achieve a sustained long-term reduction in rabbit abundance, 60-80% of female rabbits would need to be prevented from breeding. This could be achieved by a recombinant strain of myxoma provided the strain retained good transmissibility and all infected rabbits became sterile for life.

TI Alate production by aphids on sugar beet: how likely is the evolution of
   sugar beet-specific biotypes?
AB 1. Aphid clones that feed on the same plant species for many generations often develop biotypes specifically adapted to the particular host-plant. Such biotypes can be particularly damaging to crops. In the case of sugar beet Beta vulgaris, which is not available for colonization for parts of the year, aphids must migrate into and out of the crop each year if host-specific biotypes are to evolve. The likelihood of biotypes evolving to be specifically adapted to sugar beet was examined and the results are discussed in relation to the control of aphids on this crop.
   2. The frequency and causes of alate production by aphids on sugar beet were investigated by examining natural field populations, manipulated field populations and laboratory populations. Data from these studies were used in a model that estimated the probability of an aphid clone on sugar beet successfully migrating from the crop, surviving the winter and migrating back on to the crop the following year.
   3. In 2 years out of 4, no alatoid nymphs of the aphids Myzus persicae and Macrosiphum euphorbiae were produced on naturally infested crops of sugar beet, and negligible numbers were produced in the other 2 years.
   4. In spring, a much greater proportion of the My. persicae population was alatoid on oilseed rape Brassica napus than on sugar beet. Similarly in laboratory studies, a greater proportion of My. persicae was alatoid on Chinese cabbage Brassica pekinensis than on sugar beet at the same levels of crowding. The colour of the alatoid nymphs reared on Chinese cabbage indicated that it was a more suitable host than sugar beet and this might account for the greater alate production. Infection of sugar beet with beet yellows virus did not increase alate production by My. persicae.
   5. A deterministic model showed that the probability of an alate My. persicae migrating from sugar beet and recolonizing sugar beet the following year would, at best, be only 1 in 40 000.
   6. As there is negligible transfer of genetic material from year to year, we suggest that biotypes of My. persicae specifically adapted to sugar beet are unlikely to evolve. As a result, if particular aphicides were only used on sugar beet, resistance to those aphicides would be unlikely to evolve because any new resistance would not be transmitted from year to year.

TI Elimination of new chronic hepatitis B virus infections: Results of the
   Alaska immunization program
AB An immunization assessment and a serologic survey were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a hepatitis B immunization program in eliminating hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission among Alaska Natives in a region in which HBV infection is endemic. Hepatitis B vaccine coverage was 93% among 567 children less than or equal to 10 years old residing in the study villages, and catch-up vaccine coverage among 582 susceptible persons 11-30 years old was 62%, None of 271 tested children less than or equal to 10 years old were chronically infected with HBV, and just 4 (1.5%) had evidence of resolved infection. In contrast, 16% of 332 persons 11-30 years old (those born before implementation of routine infant hepatitis B vaccination) were chronically infected. A hepatitis B immunization program that includes prevention of perinatal HBV infection, routine infant vaccination, and catch-up vaccination of older children and adults can eliminate new chronic HBV infections in a population with a high rate of chronic infection.

AB This study sought to identify genital tract characteristics associated with vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 DNA and RNA, HIV-1 env diversity, and inflammatory cells were quantified in cervicovaginal lavages (CVLs) of 24 women enrolled in the Women and Infants Transmission Study; 7 women transmitted HIV-1 perinatally, Vaginal candidiasis, HIV-1 culture positivity levels of HIV-1 DNA and cell-free RNA, and HIV-1 env diversity were significantly higher in the CVLs of transmitters. CVL HIV-1 DNA levels correlated with higher levels of inflammatory cells and cell-free HIV-1 RNA, Of subjects with paired blood and CVL specimens, there was more HIV-1 env heterogeneity between blood and CVLs in transmitters than in nontransmitters. In summary, increased HIV-1, shedding is correlated with a more complex population of HIV-1 quasispecies in the genital tracts of parturient women, which may increase the probability that a fetotropic strain is transmitted.

AB The objective of this study was to determine whether the maternal infecting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 clade affects mother-to-child transmission frequency. Mothers in the mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission study in Nairobi, Kenya, were grouped by HIV-1 status of their first enrolled child: uninfected, perinatally infected, or postnatally infected, Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was used to determine HIV-1 viral clades of nested polymerase chain reaction products from HIV-1 protease or p24 genes. When inconclusive, sequencing determined the clade, Clade distributions within the groups were compared. The 3 groups displayed a uniform clade distribution. The predominant clades were A (59%) and D (20%). Clades B, C, F, mixed, and recombinant infections comprised the remainder (21%). No significant association was seen between clades A and D and either frequency or mode of vertical transmission. RFLP analysis revealed 2 clade B infections, 9 mixed, and 5 p24/protease recombinant infections in the study population.

TI Poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate): An effective candidate topical
   antimicrobial for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases
AB Presently marketed vaginal barrier agents are cytotoxic and damage the vaginal epithelium and natural vaginal flora with frequent use. Novel noncytotoxic agents are needed to protect women from sexually transmitted diseases. One candidate compound is a high-molecular-mass form of soluble poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (T-PSS), The antimicrobial activity of T-PSS was evaluated in primary culture systems and in a genital herpes murine model. Results obtained indicate that T-PSS is highly effective against herpes simplex viruses, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis in vitro. A 5% T-PSS gel protected 15 of 16 mice from vaginal herpes, compared with 2 of 16 mice treated with a placebo gel. Moreover, T-PSS exhibited little or no cytotoxicity and has an excellent selectivity index. T-PSS is an excellent candidate topical antimicrobial that blocks adherence of herpes simplex virus at low concentrations, inactivates virus at higher concentrations, and exhibits a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity.

TI Host-specific differentiation in the anther smut fungus Microbotryum
   violaceum as revealed by microsatellites
AB The anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum ( = Ustilago violacea) is a parasite of many species of the Caryophyllaceae. Its host specificity has been debated since early this century, when cross-inoculation experiments indicated the existence of host-specific lineages. Recently, on the basis of spore ultrastructure, all presumed host races were lumped within M. violaceum. To measure gene flow among natural populations of anther smuts from different host species, we used microsatellite variation at 5 loci among samples from 8 Silene, 2 Saponaria, 2 Dianthus and 1 Gypsophila species. Most of the 326 M. violaceum samples investigated originated from the Swiss Alps and close surroundings. Microsatellite variation revealed almost perfect isolation among anther smut fungi from different host species. In addition, differentiation was supported by the nonrandom distribution of null alleles among samples from different host species and host genera. Null alleles were most abundant in anther smut samples from non-Silene hosts. The resolution of genetic differentiation among anther smuts from different host species was highest in those from Silene species. Genetic relationships among samples as indicated by Neighbour-Joining analysis based on genetic distances are discussed with respect to host phylogeny and host ecology. One sample was identified as Ustilago gausseni because it had verrucose instead of reticulate spores and was collected from Silene italica. Neighbour-Joining analysis revealed that this sample was similar to the M. violaceum samples from other Silene host species. Therefore, our data question spore morphology as a reliable character for anther smut systematics.

TI Weak sinks could cradle mutualistic symbioses - strong sources should
   harbour parasitic symbioses
AB Using a population model of selection on an obligate symbiont and its host, we evaluate how demographic differences across geographical landscapes can produce selection mosaics in interacting species. The model assumes that the host populations vary geographically from demographic sources to sinks in the absence of effects by the symbionts, and that a virulent and a relatively avirulent form of the symbiont compete with one another across all habitats. Our results indicate that productivity gradients can create selection mosaics across habitats, resulting in complex fitness landscapes over which evolution occurs. We find that relatively virulent symbionts only persist if they have an advantage over avirulent strains or species in terms of interference (i.e. competition, and/or cross-transmission) interactions. When such a trade-off exists, we predict that the more virulent symbiont is most likely to be found in habitats where host population growth is highest, whereas the more avirulent symbiont should tend to persist in more marginal habitats or even habitat sinks for symbiont-free hosts. Demographic sinks may be the habitats most likely to favour the origin of new mutualisms. Very productive mutualisms can be exploited by hyperparasites or cheaters. We discuss our findings in terms of geographical scenarios for the emergence of mutualisms, and the long-standing debate about geographical patterns in the maintenance of sex.

TI Selective transmission of hepatitis B virus after percutaneous exposure
AB In 3 clusters of postsurgical hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV DNA sequence mismatches were observed between the transmitting surgeons and the patients whom they infected. Sequence analysis of clones amplified from the C gene of HBV suggested that the mismatches were due to transmission of a minority variant in the circulation of each surgeon. Compared with 5 other transmitters from whom transmission of the dominant variant was demonstrated, the 3 surgeons who transmitted minority variants carried significantly more heterogeneous HBV populations. Transmission of minority variants was not correlated with the transmitters hepatitis B antigen status, the presence of the position 1896 precore mutant, or the level of HBV viremia. In 1 cluster, a variant comprising <10% of the HBV population circulating in the transmitting surgeon established infection in all 3 patients who acquired HBV through him, which substantiates the phenomenon of true selection.

Cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were challenged with 10 TCID50 of HIV-1(MN) or HIV-1(BaL), titered in PBMC from normal controls (n = 57), PBMC from HIV-1-infected persons with low viremia (n = 17), exposed uninfected persons (n = 23), and HIV-2-infected Senegalese prostitutes (n = 9) were significantly resistant to HIV-1(BaL) and/or HIV-1(MN) (P < .001). Among 34 HIV vaccine recipients of live canarypox vector expressing multiple HIV-1 gene products with or without rgp120 booster, PBMC from postvaccination samples were significantly resistant to both strains (P < .001), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor-positive samples were significantly more resistant than were precursor-negative samples (P < .03), This is the first evidence of the induction by vaccination of a validated correlate of protection. This assay should serve as a useful criterion for assessing experimental HIV vaccines before phase III efficacy trials.

TI Prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis E in two rural Egyptian
   communities
AB A population-based serosurvey in two rural Egyptian communities was used to assess age-specific prevalence of antibody to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV). One community is in the Nile Delta (11,182 inhabitants; 3,997 participants) and the other in Upper Egypt (10,970 inhabitants; 6,029 participants). Samples were tested for anti-HEV with a commercial enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) based on antigens derived from open reading frame (ORF)2 and ORF3. Although there was a clear difference in sensitivity among the lots of the commercial test used, it was still possible to determine the seroprevalence. The seroprevalence of anti-HEV exceeded 60% in the first decade of life, peaked at 76% in the second decade and remained above 60% until the eighth decade. Prevalence of this magnitude is among the highest reported in the world, with an age-specific pattern more similar to hyperendemic hepatitis A virus transmission than generally described. Lot-to-lot variation in the sensitivity of the commercial ELISA kit highlights a problem when comparing seroepidemiologic studies of different populations.

TI Disease, frequency-dependent selection, and genetic polymorphism:
   Experiments with stripe rust and wheat
AB Pathogens have the potential to maintain genetic polymorphisms by creating frequency-dependent selection on their host. This can occur when a rare host genotype is less likely to be attacked by a pathogen (frequency-dependent disease attack) and has higher fitness at low frequency (negative frequency-dependent selection). In this study, we used wheat genotypes that were susceptible to different races of the pathogen Puccinia striiformis to test whether disease created frequency-selection on its host and whether such selection could maintain polymorphisms for resistance genes in the wheat populations. Four different two-way mixtures of wheat genotypes were planted at different frequencies in both the presence and absence of disease. Disease created frequency-dependent selection on its host in some populations. Unknown factors other than disease also created frequency-dependent selection in this system because, in some instances, rare genotype advantage was observed in the absence of disease. Although the pathogen created frequency-dependent selection on its host, this selection was not sufficient to maintain genetic polymorphism in the host populations. In all cases where frequency-dependent selection occurred only in the diseased plots, one of the two genotypes was predicted to dominate in the population and the same genotype was predicted to dominate in both the presence and absence of disease. Only in cases where frequency-dependent selection was not caused by disease was there evidence that genetic polymorphisms would be maintained in the population. The frequency-dependent selection described in this study is a consequence of epidemiological effects of disease and differs from the time-lagged frequency-dependent selection resulting from coevolution between hosts and parasites. The impact of this direct frequency-dependent selection on the maintenance of genetic polymorphisms in the host population is discussed.

TI Local adaptation, resistance, and virulence in a hemiparasitic
   plant-host plant interaction
AB Coevolution may lead to local adaptation of parasites to their sympatric hosts. Locally adapted parasites are, on average, more infectious to sympatric hosts than to allopatric hosts of the same species or their fitness on the sympatric hosts is superior to that on allopatric hosts. We tested local adaptation of a hemiparasitic plant, Rhinanthus serotinus (Scrophulariaceae), to its host plant, the grass Agrostis capillaris. Using a reciprocal cross-infection experiment, we exposed host plants from four sites to hemiparasites originating from the same four sites in a common environment. The parasites were equally able to establish haustorial connections to sympatric and allopatric hosts, and their performance was similar on both host types. Therefore, these results do not indicate local adaptation of the parasites to their sympatric hosts. However, the parasite populations differed in average biomass and number of flowers per plant and in their effect on host biomass. These results indicate that the virulence of the parasite varied among populations, suggesting genetic variation. Theoretical models suggest that local adaptation is likely to be detected if the host and the parasite have different evolutionary potentials, different migration rates, and the parasite is highly virulent. In the interaction between R. serotinus and A. capillaris all the theoretical prerequisites for local adaptation may not be fulfilled.

TI Modelling the efficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes in the regulation
   of invertebrate pests in glasshouse crops
AB 1. Entomopathogenic nematodes belonging to the families Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae are lethal obligate parasites of a wide range of invertebrate species. These nematodes exhibit many characteristics that make them ideal candidates as biological control agents of insect pests (rapid host death, high reproductive rates, easily mass-reared in vitro, easy application techniques).
   2. However, at present, the number of pest species to which these nematodes are applied successfully is small. Clearly, there is a need to develop existing knowledge of the nematode into a more complete understanding of the nematode-pest system as a whole.
   3. To consider the potential of entomopathogenic nematodes as biological control agents, we adopted a generalized analytical modelling approach and, using realistic parameter estimates, determined the conditions under which these nematodes can regulate a pest population.
   4. Stability analyses suggested that entomopathogenic nematodes may not be capable of regulating a host population to a stable equilibrium. Long-term persistence of the host and nematode population is unlikely, due to the highly destabilizing effects of the parasite-host relationship. As such, these nematodes may be better suited to short-term control through inundative application techniques rather than long-term regulation.
   5. This preliminary generalized model highlights areas where further work is needed. This includes estimation of the probability of nematode infection in the field, the effect of host size on the transmission cycle and the influence of spatial heterogeneity on stability.

TI Short-term effects of culling on the ecology and population dynamics of
   the yellow-legged gull
AB 1. Culls are being performed in many yellow-legged gull Larus cachinnans colonies in the Mediterranean region, but little is known of their effects on this species. Between 1992 and 1996, 25 000 breeding yellow-legged gulls were culled in the colony of the Medes Islands, north-western Mediterranean, because of the possible role of gulls in the transmission of pathogens and as predators on other bird species. In the present study the effect of the culls on several ecological parameters and on the population dynamics of the colony were analysed.
   2. Some breeding parameters (nest density, clutch and egg sizes, chick growth and breeding success, intraspecific predation, size and body condition of adults), diet (importance of the different prey categories and width of the trophic niche) and population dynamics of the colony were analysed during the years of cull. The annual culls did not include the entire colony, so culled and unculled areas were distinguished.
   3. Nests density decreased significantly both in the culled and the unculled areas. No significant difference in clutch size was detected between culled and unculled areas in any year, but clutch size decreased significantly through time within the culled areas. In three-egg clutches the mean egg volume was significantly larger in unculled than in culled plots, whereas no significant year effect was found. No differences were detected in the mass or in the body condition of chicks throughout the study, whereas both fledging success and breeding success increased significantly over the period of the study. Intraspecific predation had decreased significantly by 40% two years after the beginning of the study. Size and body condition of adults varied between years but no trend was observed.
   4. Despite the large decrease in breeding gull numbers and an expected reduction in intraspecific food competition, no changes in diet were detected during the study. The dietary niche width was very similar between years, and gulls continued to exploit the same foraging resources.
   5. Annual censuses showed that from 1960 to 1992, colony size increased at a rate of 5% per year. During the culling period, between 21% and 29% of the breeding adults were killed, and colony size decreased progressively at an estimated rate of 19% per year. The estimated annual adult survival according to ring recoveries during the culling period was 74%. A demographic model was developed to assess the observed changes in numbers of yellow-legged gulls. This suggested that gulls born in the Medes Islands were emigrating during the years of culling, with a particularly high estimated emigration rate of 25% per year since 1994.
   6. The planning of culling programmes by wildlife agencies has not always taken into account the multiple factors responsible for the population dynamics of colonies and the effects of culls. Culling at the Medes Islands probably failed to reduce the breeding numbers of yellow-legged gulls at the metapopulation level, due to the emigration of birds to neighbouring colonies that had recently increased in numbers. Thus, the potential problems linked to large numbers of gulls in a colony may simply have been transferred to other sites.

   structure of an urban cockroach and its haplo-diploid parasite (oxyuroid
   nematode)
AB Few studies have investigated the genetic structure of both host and parasite populations at a level of populations and at a level of individuals. We investigated the genetic structure of the urban cockroach Blattella germanica and its oxyuroid parasite Blatticola blattae. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to quantify genetic diversity between and within four populations (from two cities in France) of the host and its parasite. Diversity based on phenotypic frequencies was calculated for each RAPD marker using Shannon-Wiener's index. We used multivariate analyses to test the significance of genetic differentiation between host and parasite populations. Analysis of molecular variance was also used. Both methods gave similar results. Diversity between pairs of individuals was estimated by Nei & Li's index. Genetic diversity was higher within host or parasite populations (80% and 82%, respectively, of explained diversity) than between host or parasite populations (20% and 18%, respectively, explained diversity). The genetic distances between pairs of parasite populations (or individuals) were not correlated with the genetic distances between the corresponding pairs of host populations (or individuals).

TI Parasite-associated growth enhancement in a fish-cestode system
AB Parasites impose an energetic cost upon their hosts, yet, paradoxically instances have been reported in which infection is associated with enhanced, rather than diminished, host growth rates. Field studies of these parasite effects are problematic, since the pre-infection condition of the hosts is generally unknown. Here, we describe a laboratory experiment in which the growth rate and body condition of 76 laboratory-reared three-spined stickleback fishes were examined before, during and after each fish was fed the infective stage of the parasitic cestode Schistocephalus solidus. Twenty-one of these fishes went on to become infected by the cestode. Fishes were individually housed and provided with an abundant food supply to eliminate the potentially masking effects of variable competitive ability. Infection occurred independently of fish gender, size, body condition or pre-exposure growth rate. After exposure to the cestode, infected fishes grew faster (excluding parasite weight) and maintained a similar or better body condition compared with uninfected fishes, despite developing enlarged spleens. The accelerated growth could not be explained by reduced gonadal development. This result, one of few demonstrations of parasite-associated growth enhancement in fishes, is discussed with respect to other such parasite systems.

TI Experimentally activated immune defence in female pied flycatchers
   results in reduced breeding success
AB Traditional explanations for the negative fitness consequences of parasitism have focused on the direct pathogenic effects of infectious agents. However, because of the high selection pressure by the parasites, immune defences are likely to be costly and trade off with other fitness-related traits, such as reproductive effort. In a field experiment, we immunized breeding female flycatchers with non-pathogenic antigens (diphtheria-tetanus vaccine), which excluded the direct negative effects of parasites, in order to test the consequences of activated immune defence on hosts' investment in reproduction and self-maintenance. Immunized females decreased their feeding effort and investment in self-maintenance (rectrix regrowth) and had lower reproductive output (fledgling quality and number) than control females injected with saline. Our results reveal the phenotypic cost of immune defence by showing that an activated immune system per se can lower the host's breeding success. This may be caused by an energetic or nutritional trade-off between immune function and physical workload when feeding young or be an adaptive response to 'infection' to avoid physiological disorders such as oxidative stress and immunopathology.

TI Polymorphic growth rates in myrmecophilous insects
AB A polymorphism in growth rates was recently described affecting the larval development of the myrmecophilous butterfly Maculinea rebeli, spanning different years in a single insect population. The close integration of ni. rebeli into the host ant colonies, facilitated by adaptations in behaviour and chemical mimicry make extended lar val development a successful strategy Here we present additional data for M. rebeli and new data for;Maculinea alcon (another cuckoo-feeding lycaenid) and the two myrmecophilous predators Maculinea arion and Microdon mutabilis (Diptera: Syrphidae). As predicted, M. alcon shows the same growth pattern as nl. rebeli with a proportion of caterpillars developing in one year and the remainder over two years. This pattern holds in both northern and southern European populations, where, M. alcon exploits different species of host. Against expectation, the same bimodal distribution of pre-pupation body weights, indicating one and two year developers, was found for the larvae of M. arion and M. mutabilis. As predators, both species are less closely integrated in their host ant colonies, suggesting that the polymorphism in growth rates is a more general adaptation to a myrmecophilous life style, arrived at by convergent evolution between the Maculinea and Microdon species. For predatory species we suggest that biennialism is an adaptation to the migratory behaviour of the host made possible by the predators' ability to fast over extended periods. We also hypothesize that M. arion represents an ancestral strategy in Maculinea butterflies and that the growth polymorphism might have become genetically fixed in the cuckoo-feeding species.

TI Life history of a malaria parasite (Plasmodium mexicanum): independent
   traits and basis for variation
AB Plasmodium mexicanum, a malaria parasite of lizards, exhibits substantial variation among infections in the life-history traits which define its blood-dwelling stages. Such variation in life histories among infections is common in Plasmodium and may influence the ecology and evolution of the parasite's transmission success and virulence. Insight into these issues requires identification of independent traits (some traits may be bound by developmental trade-offs) and the importance of genetic versus host effects producing the variation. We studied 11 life-history traits in 120 induced infections of P. mexicanum in its natural lizard host (20 each from six donor infections). The traits varied among infections and fell into three clusters: rate/peak (rate of increase and peak parasitaemia of asexuals and gametocytes), time (duration of prepatent period and the infection's growth) and maturity (timing of first gametocytes). Thus, few life-history traits define an infection in the lizard's blood. Donor effects were significant for ten traits and two trait clusters (maturity was the exception) suggesting genetic differences among infections may influence the rate of increase and peak parasitaemia, but not the timing of the first production of gametocytes.

TI Adherence and drug resistance: predictions for therapy outcome
AB We combine standard pharmacokinetics with an established model of viral replication to predict the outcome of therapy as a function of adherence to the drug regimen. We consider two types of treatment failure: failure to eliminate the wild-type virus, and the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Specifically, we determine the conditions under which resistance dominates as a result of imperfect adherence. We derive this result for both single- and triple-drug therapies, with attention to conditions which favour the emergence of viral strains that are resistant to one or more drugs in a cocktail. Our analysis provides quantitative estimates of the degree of adherence necessary to prevent resistance. We derive results specific to the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection, but emphasize that our method is applicable to a range of viral or ether infections treated by chemotherapy.

TI A simplified model for predicting malaria entomologic inoculation rates
   based on entomologic and parasitologic parameters relevant to control
AB Malaria transmission intensity is modeled from the starting perspective of individual vector mosquitoes and is expressed directly as the entomologic inoculation rate (EIR). The potential of individual mosquitoes to transmit malaria during their lifetime is presented graphically as a function of their feeding cycle length and survival, human biting preferences, and the parasite sporogonic incubation period. The EIR is then calculated as the product of 1) the potential of individual vectors to transmit malaria during their lifetime, 2) vector emergence rate relative to human population size, and 3) the infectiousness of the human population to vectors. Thus, impacts on more than one of these parameters will amplify each other's effects. The EIRs transmitted by the dominant vector species at four malaria-endemic sites from Papua New Guinea, Tanzania, and Nigeria were predicted using field measurements of these characteristics together with human biting rate and human reservoir infectiousness. This model predicted EIRs (+/- SD) that are 1.13 +/- 0.37 (range = 0.84-1.59) times those measured in the field, For these four sites, mosquito emergence rate and lifetime transmission potential were more important determinants of the EIR than human reservoir infectiousness. This model and the input parameters from the four sites allow the potential impacts of various control measures on malaria transmission intensity to be tested under a range of endemic conditions. The model has potential applications for the development and implementation of transmission control measures and for public health education.

TI Effects of synchrony with host plant on populations of a spring-feeding
   Lepidopteran
AB Comparisons of traits of outbreaking and nonoutbreaking leaf-eating Lepidoptera and Symphyta have shown that spring-feeding species are more likely to have outbreaks than are summer-feeding species. It has been suggested that variable synchrony with host budburst causes the population sizes of spring-feeding species to be more variable primarily because of the negative effects of older leaves on insects. While much evidence exists that leaf age can directly affect survival and reproduction of insects, few studies have looked at the population-level effects of variable phenology, and especially the potential for complex direct and indirect interactions with natural-enemy effects. To examine the consequences of variable phenology for population growth of an outbreaking insect, we manipulated the timing of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) egg hatch in the field. We released large numbers of gypsy moth larvae into replicate plots in the field at three times relative to budburst. Survival of larvae in protective sleeves was high unless they were released very long before host budburst, and leaf age had a direct negative effect on fecundity: the later the release, the lower was the fecundity of insects reared on white oak and black oak. The later the release, however, the greater was the dispersal by ballooning, which had the effect of reducing local densities. Because the most important natural enemies impose density-dependent mortality, dispersal had the effect of raising survival rate for later release dates. The direct host-plant effect and natural-enemy effects exhibited opposing influences on population processes, because fecundity decreased with release date but survival increased. The survival advantage of the late release outweighed the loss in fecundity, so that the expected population growth rate was highest for the latest release. The net effects of phenology on insect population growth thus depend largely on natural-enemy effects. Very different conclusions would have been drawn had we measured mortality only in protective sleeves and not in the presence of natural enemies. The strong natural-enemy effects may explain the large variability in outcome of plant-herbivore interactions and contribute to the high variability in population size of spring-feeding species.

TI Variation in intensity of a parasitic mite (Spinturnix myoti) in
   relation to the reproductive cycle and immunocompetence of its bat host
   (Myotis myotis)
AB Given the intimate association in host-parasite systems, parasites are expected to initiate their own reproduction when vulnerable hosts become abundant and/or when adult hosts are less resistant. In this study, we examined the variation in the intensities of a blood-sucking mite (Spinturnix myoti, Acarina) with respect to the reproductive cycle and immunocompetence of its host, the greater mouse-eared bat Myotis myotis. Reproductive, pregnant females were less immunocompetent and harboured more parasites than nonreproductive females, whilst, during lactation, immunocompetence was positively associated with female body mass. There was a dramatic increase in the T-cell response of gravid females with the advancement of gestation, which coincided with a diminution of individual parasite loads and a progressive switch of parasites from adults to juveniles. The latter not only harboured greater numbers of mites than adult female bats, but they also exhibited gravid parasites in higher proportions, indicating that juvenile hosts are more attractive for parasite reproduction than adult females.

TI Can plants use entomopathogens as bodyguards?
AB For 20 years, ecologists have been gathering evidence in support of the hypothesis chat plants can use insect natural enemies such as Predators and parasitoids as bodyguards to protect themselves from herbivory, but entomopathogens have escaped this consideration. We extend the bodyguard hypothesis to ask whether plants can use entomopathogens as bodyguards. We first discuss the evolutionary context of such tritrophic interactions and then categorize possible mechanisms as: (1) maintaining a population of bodyguards on the plant surface, (2) increasing contact rates between insect host and pathogen and (3) increasing the susceptibility of the host. We explore these mechanisms further, examining published studies for evidence for the hypothesis. We then discuss potential costs to the plant of promoting pathogens as bodyguards which may include a reduction in the efficiency of other "bodyguard" species, the incidental promotion of plant pathogens and the risk of entomopathogens developing phytopathogenicity. Aside from our intention to stimulate the resting of the bodyguard hypothesis with entompathogens and to provide a conceptual framework for this, we hope to bring evolutionary ecology and insect pathology closer together.

TI Sublethal infection and the population dynamics of host-microparasite
   interactions
AB 1. A large group of parasites, including many of the larval pathogens of insects, cause an infection from which infectious hosts are unable to recover. In addition, a proportion of those individuals that do not develop the lethal disease on exposure to the parasite may still be harmed by it.
   2. We examined the role of these sublethal effects on host-population dynamics. Specifically we considered the case where there are three distinct classes of individuals: (i) susceptibles; (ii) infected and infectious individuals that will not reproduce and cannot recover; and (iii) sublethally infected individuals.
   3. Parasites with sublethal effects are less likely to persist and control their host population. This is a consequence of the sublethally infected individuals not being infective. Less intuitively, the sublethal infection is highly destabilizing, increasing the risk of cyclic behaviour in host-parasite population densities.
   4. Because sublethal infection acts as a destabilizing force in these host-parasite interactions, parasites with pronounced sublethal effects may be less effective as classical biological control agents.

TI Human herpesvirus 8 in Brazilian Amerindians: A hyperendemic population
   with a new subtype
AB Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) epidemiology in Brazilian Amerindians was studied. Use of an immunofluorescence (IFA) test for latent antibody demonstrated that the prevalence of HHV-8 in 781 Amerindians of diverse tribes (overall, 53% prevalence) was not related to language group or sex but rather increased gradually from 41% in children <10 years of age to 65% in adults greater than or equal to 30 years of age. In IFA-positive subjects, HHV-8 DNA was detected in 3 (16%) of 19 mononuclear cell samples from peripheral blood and in 1 of 16 saliva samples, The sequences of conserved ORF22 and K6 genes were typical of HHV-8, but the variable KI gene sequences were only 70%-75% identical to other known HHV-8 strains. Thus, a new HHV-8 subtype, E, is hyperendemic in Brazilian Amerindians, although Kaposi's sarcoma has not been reported. Transmission is probably oral rather than sexual. The limited genetic pool in isolated groups may permit more frequent transmission of a virus with a low prevalence in heterogeneous populations.

TI Does the presence of ant nests matter for oviposition to a specialized
   myrmecophilous Maculinea butterfly?
AB More than 50% of the lycaenid butterflies have an ant-associated lifestyle (myrmecophily) which may vary from coexistence to specific mutualistic or even parasitic interactions. Ant-related host-plant selection and oviposition has been observed in some myrmecophilous lycaenids. Therefore, it is remarkable that there is no evidence for this behaviour in the highly specialized, obligate myrmecophilous butterflies of the genus Maculinea. In contrast with previous findings, our results provide evidence for ant-related oviposition patterns in Maculinea alcon in relation to the distribution of specific host-ant nests (i.e. Myrmica ruginodis) based on repeated egg counts during the flight period in two populations. We also show that ant-related oviposition can be counterbalanced by intraspecific competition and oviposition deterrency when host plants already carry several eggs. Therefore, the absence of a correlation between egg load and the presence of host-ant nests at the end of the flight period should be interpreted carefully. Whether ovipositional cues are obtained either directly (from ants or their nests) or indirectly (from vegetation structure), and whether alternative explanations based on the phenology and growth form of host plants are possible, is discussed.

TI Serologic responses of Korean soldiers serving in malaria-endemic areas
   during a recent outbreak of Plasmodium vivax
AB Anti-Pv200 antibody levels were assessed in samples from endemic areas of Plasmodium vivax malaria in the Republic of Korea (ROK), using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Asymptomatic carriers of P. vivax were detected using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood samples. Anti-Pv200 antibody levels in 20 vivax malaria patients (optical density + standard deviation [OD +/- SD] values 1.85 +/-= 0.29 of IgG isotype and 1.33 +/- 1.33 of IgM isotype) were markedly higher than those of uninfected, malaria-naive controls (0.08 +/- 0.16 of IgG isotype and 0.04 +/- 0.04 of IgM isotype). Antibody levels for 7 out of 8 soldiers with a recent malaria infection were sustained above the cut-off values for 4 months after successful treatment. Analysis of serum collected from 40 healthy, asymptomatic soldiers who had a P. vivax malaria attack within 3 months after our sampling, revealed 11 antibody-positive samples (27.5%), compared to 5 positive samples (12.5%) collected from a random selection of 40 soldiers. Among a larger pool of 1.713 soldiers who had served in high-risk areas for P. vivax transmission, 15% were antibody positive. Among 1,000 blood samples from asymptomatic soldiers who had served in the high-risk areas, 4 samples (0.4%) were parasite positive, as determined by nested PCR. Our results show that anti-Pv200 antibody levels can provide useful information in the late diagnosis of P. vivax malaria infection in a previously naive population and also in large seroepidemiologic studies. Furthermore, our results suggest that asymptomatic P. vivax carriers could be important in the current outbreak of malaria in Korea.

TI Assessment of parasite-mediated selection in a host-parasite system in
   plants
AB A two-year field study was conducted to evaluate the potential of two cactus species, Echinopsis chilensis and Eulychnia acida, to evolve defensive traits against the parasitic mistletoe Tristerix aphyllus (Loranthaceae). The adaptive value of host traits against parasitism was inferred through: (1) identification of the relevant characters of cacti to prevent infection, (2) evaluation of the fitness impact of parasitism on cacti, and (3) estimation of the linear and nonlinear selection coefficients on the relevant characters. Different lines of experimental and correlative evidence indicated that spine length was important in preventing individuals of the two cactus species from becoming parasitized. However, the impact of the mistletoe on cactus fecundity was contingent on the species involved. Even though parasitism decreased fruit production, seed number per fruit, and the total seed output in E. chilensis, low and nonsignificant linear and nonlinear gradients of selection were prevalent in this species, indicating absence of directional and stabilizing/disruptive selection for spine length. Additional analysis based on logistic regression, however, revealed that long-spined E. chilensis had a higher probability of reproduction than did short-spined individuals. Unlike its effect on E, chilensis, the mistletoe had no fitness impact on E. acida, and the maintenance and evolution of spines in this species could not be attributed to parasite-mediated selection. Even though spines act as a first line of defense against parasitism in the two cactus species, selection was detected only on E. chilensis. These results indicate that inferences on the adaptive value of host traits based only upon their role in preventing infection run the risk of overestimating parasite-mediated selection, and thus the potential for host-parasite coevolution.

TI Spatiotemporal variation in leafminer population structure and
   adaptation to individual oak trees
AB Stilbosis quadricustatella leafminers are microlepidopteran specialists of sand-live oak (Quercus geminata). These tiny moths produce one generation per year and have a parasitic life-cycle and long larval stage that develops entirely within la single oak leaf. Differences in host-plant age, phenotype, and phenology generate a coarse-grained, spatially heterogeneous environment for the leafminer population. Previous reciprocal transfers of leafminer eggs among mature oaks revealed that S. quadricustatella are locally adapted to individual oak trees. In this paper we use genetic markers and an extinction-recolonization experiment to explore further variation in leafminer population structure. Allozyme loci indicate significant interdemic genetic structure among recent colonists of new host trees, which weakens in the 10th generation and disappears by the 40th generation. In contrast,adaptive demic structure is evident by the 10th generation and is strong in the 40th generation, despite the potential for substantial intertree dispersal. We propose that host heterogeneity combined with leafminer fidelity to natal trees promotes divergent selection and rapid demic evolution on individual oaks, despite potentially high gene flow between the leafminers inhabiting them.

TI EPIFIL: The development of an age-structured model for describing the
   transmission dynamics and control of lymphatic filariasis
AB Mathematical models of transmission dynamics of infectious diseases provide a useful tool for investigating the impact of community based control measures. Previously, we used a dynamic (constant force-of-infection) model for lymphatic filariasis to describe observed patterns of infection and disease in endemic communities. In this paper, we expand the model to examine the effects of control options against filariasis by incorporating the impact of age structure of the human community and by addressing explicitly the dynamics of parasite transmission from and to the vector population. This model is tested using data for Wuchereria bancrofti transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus in Pondicherry, South India. The results show that chemotherapy has a larger short-term impact than vector control but that the effects of vector control can last beyond the treatment period. In addition we compare rates of recrudescence for drugs with different macrofilaricidal effects.

Trapping was carried out at 4-weekly intervals over 3 years and each animal caught was uniquely identified, blood sampled and tested for antibodies to cowpox. Antibody prevalence was higher in bank voles than in wood mice and seroconversion varied seasonally, with peaks in autumn. Infection was most common in males of both species but no clear association with age was demonstrated. This study provides a model for studying other zoonotic infections that derive from wild mammals since other approaches, such as one-off samples, will fail to detect the variation in infection and thus, risk to human health, demonstrated here.

AB ELISA techniques developed for the veterinary diagnosis of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD) in domestic rabbits were used for studying the epidemiology of RHD in Australian wild rabbits. The combination of ELISA techniques that distinguished IEA, IgG and IgM antibody responses and a longitudinal data set, mainly based on capture-mark-recapture of rabbits, provided a reliable basis for interpreting serology and set the criteria used to classify rabbits' immunological status. Importantly, young with maternal antibodies, immune rabbits and rabbits apparently re-exposed to RHD were readily separated. Three outbreaks of RHD occurred ill 1996-7. The timing of RHD outbreaks was mainly driven by recruitment of young rabbits that generally contracted RHD after they lost their maternally derived immunity. Young that lost maternal antibodies in summer were not immediately infected, apparently because transmission of RHDV slows at that time, but contracted RHD in the autumn when conditions were again suitable for disease spread.

TI Molecular ecology and biological control: the mating system of a

AB Many studies in molecular ecology have focused on the use of repeat DNA markers to determine the nature of mating systems in a wide variety of animal species. Whilst these studies typically have focused on important issues such as the evolutionary consequences of fitness variation among males, genetic studies of mating systems are potentially also important because they can generate information of significance to wider issues in wildlife management. For example, genetically modified, sexually transmitted viral diseases have been suggested as potential agents for the control of vertebrate pest species. An understanding of the epidemiology of such agents requires an intimate knowledge of the sexual contact rates between individuals of the target species. Here, we report the use of minisatellite DNA profiling to reveal the mating system in two New Zealand populations of the introduced Australian brushtail possum. The brushtail possum is New Zealand's most important mammalian pest and a species for which control by a sexually transmitted immunocontraceptive has been proposed. Encouragingly, we report considerable variation in the reproductive success of males at both study sites, with one male siring offspring from four females in one year (mean no. of offspring/reproductively successful male/year at the two sites is 1.95-2.15), while many sired none. This bias in the pattern of reproductive success among males will probably facilitate the spread of an immunocontraceptive agent and thereby increase the power of this approach to biological control.

TI Island and taxon effects in parasitism and resistance of Lesser
   Antillean birds
AB Patterns of parasitism in insular avian communities can provide insight into processes that maintain host-parasite associations. On one hand, replicable relationships within evolutionarily independent communities of the same host and parasite taxa would indicate that these interactions are stable over time. On the other hand, unique ecological conditions on each island, sporadic colonizations and extinctions, plus new genetic variation would lead to island-specific host-parasite relationships. We examined the: distribution of three parasitic taxa among avian host species on three islands in the Lesser Antilles: St. Lucia, Martinique, and Dominica. Blood protozoa of the genus Haemoproteus were found in 34% of host individuals examined. A significant species effect, but no significant island effect, was observed, suggesting an ecologically stable and replicable host-parasite association. Cysts of the tissue-dwelling protozoan genus Sarcocystis were observed in 4% (9% on Dominica) of host individuals and were significantly associated with ground foraging. Epithelial lesions characteristic of avian papilloma virus were recorded in 4% of host individuals on Martinique only. The pattern of infection with papilloma virus or Sarcocystis (significant island effect) indicated that host species on a particular island are linked in transmission webs of these parasites. Such island-specific associations suggest a role for either history or unique local ecology in host-parasite associations.
   There was a statistically significant interaction between island and species effects in the prevalence of Haemoproteus. This may stem from the independent evolution of host-parasite interactions in the different island populations. We were able to assess the extent of genetic divergence of the host species by analysis of mitochondrial ATPase 6,8 sequences. There was little genetic divergence between island populations of the host species. Therefore, the variation in Haemoproteus prevalence is not likely to be related to genetic differentiation of the host populations.
   Birds infected with Haemoproteus exhibited elevated leukocyte levels indicative of immunological control of the parasite. After statistically controlling for the intensity of Haemoproteus infection and host species, leukocyte levels varied significantly among islands on which the host resided. This is consistent with the idea that insular avian communities are linked by transmission webs of parasites having broad host specificity.

TI Linking genetic change to community evolution: insights from studies of
   bacteria and bacteriophage
AB A major goal of community ecology is to link biological processes at lower scales with community patterns. Microbial communities are especially powerful model systems for making these links. In this article, we review recent studies of laboratory communities of bacteria and bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria). We focus on the ecology and evolution of bacteriophage-resistance as a case study demonstrating the relationship between specific genes, individual interactions, population dynamics, community structure, and evolutionary change. In laboratory communities of bacteria and bacteriophage, bacteria rapidly evolve resistance to bacteriophage infection. Different resistance mutations produce distinct resistance phenotypes, differing, for example, in whether resistance is partial or complete, in the magnitude of the physiological cost associated with resistance, and in whether the mutation can be countered by a host-range mutation in the bacteriophage. These differences determine whether a mutant can invade, the effect its invasion has on the population dynamics of sensitive bacteria and phage, and the resulting structure of the community. All of these effects, in turn, govern the community's response to environmental change and its subsequent evolution.

AB Bacteria that are vertically transmitted through female hosts and kill male hosts that inherit them were first recorded in insects during the 1950s. Recent studies have shown these "male-killers" to be diverse and have led to a reappraisal of the biology of many groups of bacteria. Rickettsia, for instance, have been regarded as human pathogens transmitted by arthropods. The finding of a male-killing Rickettsia obligately associated with an insect suggests that the genus' members may be primarily associated with arthropods and are only sometimes pathogens of vertebrates. We examined both how killing of male hosts affects the dynamics of inherited bacteria and how male-killing bacteria affect their host populations. Finally, we assessed the potential use of these microorganisms in the control of insect populations.

TI Non-linear transmission and simple models for bovine tuberculosis
AB 1. A new model is presented for a possum-tuberculosis (TB) system (Trichosurus vulpecula-Mycobacterium bovis) that is both realistic and parsimonious. The model includes a phenomenological treatment of heterogeneity of risk for susceptible hosts, similar to that used in insect host-parasitoid systems.
   2. Parameter values for the model reflect current knowledge and differ significantly from those in other recent models of this system. Associated with these structural and parametric changes are substantially different predictions for the dynamics and control of TB in possums.
   3. The model predictions include (i) only limited host suppression due to the disease (< 10%, cf. several earlier simple models for TB in both possums and badgers); (ii) asymptotically stable disease dynamics (cf. homogeneous-mixing models that predict either extremely weak stability such that disease fails to recover when host density is temporarily reduced, or oscillatory behaviour and potential elimination of disease following such a perturbation); (iii) TB that is harder to control than in the homogeneous-mixing model equivalents, in line with practical experience; and (iv) a threshold host density for disease elimination that differs substantially from the host equilibrium density in the presence of disease.
   4. Homogeneous-mixing models are unable to reproduce this behaviour, whatever parameter values are chosen. Heterogeneous-mixing models with non-linear transmission may therefore be worth consideration in other endemic wildlife disease systems, as is now commonplace for insect-parasitoid and insect-pathogen ones.

TI Evolutionary transition to a semelparous life history in the socially
   parasitic ant Acromyrmex insinuator
AB The recently discovered social parasite Acromyrmex insinuator (Schultz, Bekkevold & Boomsma 1998) exploits colonies of the leafcutter ant A. echinatior. We document that A. insinuator represents a rare early stage in the evolution of social parasitism, because a worker caste is still partially present and mating phenology has remained at least partially similar to that of the host. A. insinuator is tolerant of host queens, and sexual offspring produced in parasitized colonies can be either exclusively A. insinuator or a mix of A. insinuator and A. echinatior. The remarkably high abundance of A. insinuator in nests of the investigated Panamanian host population and the fact that A. insinuator colonies readily reproduce under laboratory conditions allowed us to test evolutionary predictions on reproductive life history evolution that are not possible in most other socially parasitic ants. We show that (1) A. insinuator has a semelparous 'big bang' reproductive life history which exploits host colonies without leaving reserves for survival; (2) social parasite sexuals are significantly smaller than A. echinatior host sexuals, but still large compared to host workers, confirming an evolutionary scenario of gradual size reduction and loss of the worker caste after transition towards a socially parasitic life history; (3) major changes in the life history of ants can evolve relatively quickly compared to adaptations in morphology, caste differentiation and mating phenology.

However, it is not clear whether HIV-1 is shed in semen continuously or intermittently. In a prospective longitudinal study viral RNA was measured weekly for 10 weeks in semen and blood of HIV-seropositive subjects, Results showed three different patterns of HIV-1 shedding in semen: none (28%), continuous (28%), and intermittent (44%). In contrast, there was no change in blood plasma virus load during the study period, Phylogenetic analysis of the envelope sequences of HIV-1 RNA in semen and blood revealed distinct virus populations in semen and blood of intermittent shedders but similar virus populations in the semen and blood of continuous shedder. These results indicate for the first time that HIV-1 is shed primarily in an intermittent manner and that shedding patterns of HIV-1 in semen are related to compartmentalization of HIV-1 between semen and blood.

In Drosophila melanogaster the abilities to encapsulate the wasp species Leptopilina boulardi and Asobara tabida each involve one major gene. Both resistance genes have been precisely localized on the second chromosome, 35 centimorgans apart. This result clearly demonstrates the involvement of at least two separate genetic systems in Drosophila resistance to parasitoid wasps. The resistance genes to L. boulardi and A. tabida are not clustered as opposed to many plant resistance genes to pathogens cloned to date.

TI Male-killing Wolbachia in a flour beetle
AB The bacteria in the genus Wolbachia are cytoplasmically inherited symbionts of arthropods. Infection often causes profound changes in host reproduction, enhancing bacterial transmission and spread in a population. The reproductive alterations known to result from Wolbachia infection include cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), parthenogenesis, feminization of genetic males, fecundity enhancement, male killing and, perhaps lethality. Here, we report male killing in a third insect, the black flour beetle Tribolium madens, based on highly female-biased sex ratios of progeny from females infected with Wolbachia. The bias is cytoplasmic in nature as shown by repeated backcrossing of infected females with males of a naturally uninfected strain. Infection also lowers the egg hatch rates significantly to approximately half of thus; observed for uninfected females. Treatment of the host with antibiotics eliminated infection; reverted the sex ratio to unbiased levels and increased the percentage hatch. Typically Wolbachia infection is transmitted from mother to progeny, regardless of the sex of the progeny; however, infected T. madens males are never found. Virgin females are sterile, suggesting that the sex-ratio distortion in T. madens results from embryonic male killing rather than parthenogenesis. Based on DNA sequence data, the male-killing strain of Wolbachia in T. madens was indistinguishable from the CI-inducing Wolbachia in Tribolium confusum, a closely related beetle. Our findings suggest that host-symbiont interaction effects may play an important role in the induction of Wolbachia reproductive phenotypes.

TI Pathogen-driven outbreaks in forest defoliators revisited: Building
   models from experimental data
AB Models of outbreaks in forest-defoliating insects are typically built from a priori considerations and tested only with long time series of abundances. We instead present a model built from experimental data on the gypsy moth and its nuclear polyhedrosis virus, which has been extensively tested with epidemic data. These data have identified key details of the gypsy moth-virus interaction that are missing from earlier models, including seasonality in host reproduction, delays between host infection and death, and heterogeneity among hosts in their susceptibility to the virus. Allowing for these details produces models in which annual epidemics are followed by bouts of reproduction among surviving hosts and leads to quite different conclusions than earlier models. First, these models suggest that pathogen-driven outbreaks in forest defoliators occur partly because newly hatched insect larvae have higher average susceptibility than do older larvae. Second, the models show that a combination of seasonality and delays between infection and death can lead to unstable cycles in the absence of a stabilizing mechanism; these cycles, however, are stabilized by the levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility that we have observed in our experimental data. Moreover, our experimental estimates of virus transmission rates and levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility in gypsy moth populations give model dynamics that closely approximate the dynamics of real gypsy moth populations. Although we built our models from data for gypsy moth, our models are, nevertheless, quite general. Our conclusions are therefore likely to be true, not just for other defoliator-pathogen interactions, but for many host-pathogen interactions in which seasonality plays an important role. Our models thus give qualitative insight into the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions, while providing a quantitative interpretation of our gypsy moth-virus data.

TI The coevolution of parasites with host-acquired immunity and the
   evolution of sex
AB Here I present a deterministic model of the coevolution of parasites with the acquired immunity of their hosts, a system in which coevolutionary oscillations can be maintained. These dynamics can confer an advantage to sexual reproduction within the parasite population, but the effect is not strong enough to outweigh the twofold cost of sex. The advantage arises primarily because sexual reproduction impedes the response to fluctuating epistasis and not because it facilitates the response to directional selection-in fact, sexual reproduction often slows the response to directional selection. Where the cost of sexual reproduction is small, a polymorphism can be maintained between the sexuals and the asexuals. A polymorphism is maintained in which the advantage gained due to recombination is balanced by the cost of sex. At much higher costs of sex, a polymorphism between the asexual and sexual populations can still be maintained if the asexuals do not have a full complement of genotypes available to them, because the asexuals only outcompete those sexuals with which they share the same selected alleles. However, over rime we might expect the asexuals to amass the full array of genotypes, thus permanently eliminating sexuals from the population. The sexuals may avoid this fate if the parasite population is finite. Although the model presented here describes the coevolution of parasites with the acquired immune responses of their hosts. it can be compared with other host-parasite models that have more traditionally been used to investigate Red Queen theories of the evolution of sex.

TI Detection of a major gene predisposing to human T lymphotropic virus
   type I infection in children among an endemic population of African
   origin
AB Human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is a human oncoretrovirus that causes an adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma and a chronic neuromyelopathy, To investigate whether familial aggregation of HTLV-I infection (as determined by specific seropositive status) could be explained in part by genetic factors, we conducted a large genetic epidemiological survey in an HTLV-I-endemic population of African origin from French Guiana, All of the families in 2 villages were included, representing 83 pedigrees with 1638 subjects, of whom 165 (10.1%) were HTLV-I seropositive. The results of segregation analysis are consistent with the presence of a dominant major gene predisposing to HTLV-I infection, in addition to the expected familial correlations (mother-offspring, spouse-spouse) due to the virus transmission routes. Under this genetic model, similar to 1.5% of the population is predicted to be highly predisposed to HTLV-I infection, and almost all seropositive children <10 years of age are genetic cases, whereas most HTLV-I seropositive adults are sporadic cases.

TI Sexually transmitted diseases in polygynous mating systems: prevalence
   and impact on reproductive success
AB Studies of disease in relation to animal mating systems have focused on sexual selection and the evolution of sexual reproduction. Relatively little work has examined other aspects of ecological and evolutionary relationships between host social and sexual behaviour, and dynamics and prevalence of infectious diseases; this is particularly evident with respect to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Here, we use a simulation approach investigate rates of STD spread in host mating systems ranging from permanent monogamy to serial polygyny or polyandry and complete promiscuity. The model assumes that one sex (female) is differentially attracted to the other; such that groups of varying size are formed within which mating and disease transmission occur. The results show that equilibrium disease levels are generally higher in females than males and are a function of variance in male mating success and the likelihood of a female switching groups between mating seasons. Moreover, initial rates of disease spread (determining whether an STD establishes s in a population) depend on patterns of host movement between groups, variance in male mating success and host life history (e.g. mortality rates). Male reproductive success can be reduced substantially by a sterilizing STD and this reduction is greater in males that are more 'attractive' to females. In contrast, females that associate with more attractive males have lower absolute fitness than females; associating with less attractive males. Thus, the potential for STDs to act as a constraint on directional selection processes leading to polygyny (or polyandry) is likely to depend on the details of mate choice and group, dynamics.

TI Host specificity in avian blood parasites: a study of Plasmodium and
   Haemoproteus mitochondrial DNA amplified from birds
AB A fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of avian malaria (genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium) was amplified from blood samples of 12 species of passerine birds from the genera Acrocephalus, Phylloscopus and Parus. By sequencing 478 nucleotides of the obtained fragments, we found 17 different mitocholdrial haplotypes of Haemoproteus or Plasmodium among the 12 bird species investigated. Only one out of the: 17 haplotypes was found in more than one host species, this exception being a haplotype detected in both blue tits (Parus caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major). The phylogenetic tree which was constructed grouped the sequences into two clades, most probably representing Haemoproteus and Plasmodium, respectively. We found two to four different parasite mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes in four bird species. The phylogenetic tree obtained from the mtDNA of the parasites matched the phylogenetic tree of the bird hosts poorly For example, the two tit species and the willow warbler (Phylloscopus troclilus) carried parasites differing by only 0.6% sequence divergence, suggesting that Haemoproteus shift both between species within the same genus and also between species in different families. Hence, host shifts seem to have occurred repeatedly in this parasite-host system. We discuss this in terms of the possilble evolutionary consequences for these bird species.

TI Fatal attraction in rats infected with Toxoplasma gondii
AB We tested the hypothesis that the parasite Toxoplasma gondii manipulates the behaviour of its intermediate rat host in order to increase its chance of being predated by cats, its feline definitive host, thereby ensuring the completion of its life cycle. Here we report that, although rats have evolved anti-predator avoidance of areas with signs of cat presence, T. gondii's manipulation appears to alter the rat's perception of cat predation risk, ill some cases turning their innate aversion into an imprudent attraction. The selectivity of such behavioural changes suggests that this ubiquitous parasite subtly alters the brain of its intermediate host to enhance predation rate whilst leaving other behavioural categories and general health intact. This is in contrast to the gross impediments frequently characteristic of many other host-parasite systems. We discuss our results in terms of their potential implications both for the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis and the neurological basis of anxiety and cognitive processes in humans and other mammals.

   people of the Amazon basin of Ecuador
AB An outbreak of delta hepatitis occurred during 1998 among the Waorani of the Amazon basin of Ecuador. Among 58 people identified with jaundice, 79% lived in four of 22 Waorani communities. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was found in the sera of 54% of the jaundiced persons, and 14% of asymptomatic persons. Ninety-five percent of 105 asymptomatic Waorani had hepatitis B core (HBc) IgG antibody, versus 98% of 51 with jaundice. These data confirm I:hat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic among the Waorani. Sixteen of 23 (70%) HBsAg carriers identified at the onset of the epidemic had serologic markers for hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection. All 16 were jaundiced, where as only two of seven (29%) with negative HDV serology were jaundiced (P = .0006). The delta cases clustered in families, 69% were children and most involved superinfection of people chronically infected with HBV. The data suggest that HDV spread rapidly by a horizontal mode of transmission other than by the sexual route.

TI The role of shared parasites in the exclusion of wildlife hosts:
   Heterakis gallinarum in the ring-necked pheasant and the grey partridge
AB 1, A two-host shared-macroparasite model was parameterized from the results of infection and transmission experiments, to investigate whether apparent competition between the ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and the grey partridge (Perdix perdix), mediated via the shared nematode Heterakis gallinarum, could theoretically cause partridge exclusion.
   2, Both the model created and the experiments conducted show that the bulk of H. gallinarum infection to partridges, when they occur in the same locations as pheasants, will be from the pheasants and not from the partridges themselves. This is due to Ro for the parasite being 1.23 when infecting pheasants, but only 0.0057 when infecting partridges. Thus, when the pheasant is present in the model the partridge population is impacted by the shared parasite but, when the pheasant is absent, the parasite is lost from the system.
   3, Based on best available parameter estimates, the observed impact of H. gallinarum on the grey partridge may be sufficient to cause exclusion when the pheasant is present in the model. This supports the hypothesis that the UK grey partridge decline observed over the past 50 years may be partly due to apparent competition with pheasants,
   4, Habitat separation between the two host species, where it decreases the rate of H. gallinarum transmission from the pheasant to the partridge, may allow them to co-exist in the field in the presence of the parasite. We predict, however, that grey partridge exclusion would still occur if separation was less than 43%.

TI Local adaptation of a holoparasitic plant, Cuscuta europaea: variation
   among populations
AB Locally adapted parasites have higher infectivity and/or fitness on sympatric than on allopatric hosts. We tested local adaptation of a holoparasitic plant, Cuscuta europaea, to its host plant, Urtica dioica. We infected hosts from five sites with holoparasites from the same five sites and measured local adaptation in terms of infectivity and parasite performance (biomass) in a reciprocal cross-infection experiment. The virulence of the parasite did not differ between sympatric and allopatric hosts. Overall, parasites had higher infectivity on sympatric hosts but infectivity and parasite performance varied among populations. Parasites from one of the populations showed local adaptation in terms of performance, whereas parasites from one of the populations had higher infectivity on allopatric hosts compared with sympatric hosts. This among-population variation may be explained by random variation in parasite adaptation to host populations or by time-lagged co-evolutionary oscillations that lead to fluctuations in the level of local adaptation.

Sixteen cats were placed into 4 groups: FIV only, morphine only, morphine/FIV, and controls. Multiple acute morphine exposure did not increase the severity of early lentivirus infection. On the contrary, it delayed or moderated the FIV-induced disease progression. Although the animals were exposed to only 1 injection of morphine per day for 2 consecutive days per week, the morphine-treated FIV-infected animals had a delayed onset of the FIV-induced lymphadenopathy, did not develop or had a significant delay in the FIV-induced effects on brain stem auditory evoked potentials, and demonstrated a trend toward decreased virus load.

TI Host nutritional status and its effect on a viral pathogen
AB The nutritional status of the host has long been associated with both severity and susceptibility to infectious disease. The accepted model system proposes that inadequate nutrition impairs the functioning of the immune system, thus resulting in increased susceptibility to infection. However, current work suggests that not only can the nutritional status of the host affect the immune response, but it can also affect the viral pathogen, In a mouse model, a benign strain of coxsackievirus B3 became virulent and caused myocarditis in selenium- and vitamin E-deficient mice. This change in pathogenicity was due to mutations in the viral genome, which changed an avirulent virus into a virulent one, Once these mutations occurred, even mice with normal nutriture developed disease from the mutated virus. These results suggest that the oxidative stress status of the hose can have a profound influence on a viral pathogen.

AB Most of the countries in western Europe have now implemented mass infant rubella immunization programmes, instead of or in addition to selective vaccination in order to achieve the elimination of congenital rubella syndrome.
   The European countries Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands undertook large, national serological surveys collecting several thousand serum specimens during 1994-8, Antibodies against rubella virus were detected by a variety of enzyme immune-assays. Comparability of the assay results was achieved by a standardized methodology. The age- and sex-stratified serological results were related to the schedules, coverage of rubella vaccination and the incidence in these countries.
   The results show widely differing levels of immunity to rubella both in the general population and in the specific age groups of males and females. A low rate (<5%) of susceptibles in childhood and adolescents of both sexes was obtained only in Finland and the Netherlands.
   Countries such as Italy with only moderate coverage for the infant immunization programme currently have both high susceptibility levels in the general population and in the at-risk population. The likelihood is of continued epidemics of rubella with cases of congenital rubella syndrome. The continued implementation of selective vaccination will help to offset the impact of this ongoing transmission and to protect women on reaching childbearing age.

TI HCV prevalence in pregnant women in the UK
AB The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in pregnant women in the North Thames region, and in the UK in general. Demographic data were linked to neonatal samples prior to anonymization and testing by anti-HCV EIA, and with RIBA 3 confirmation. Risk factors for maternal infection were explored. Area-specific seroprevalence rates were multiplied into population sizes to estimate HCV prevalence in pregnant women in the UK. A total of 241/126009 samples were confirmed anti-HCV positive. and a further 40 were indeterminate, representing a seroprevalence of 0.19-0.22%; 51% of maternal HCV infections were in UK-born women (71% of the population), and 22% in women from continental Europe (5% of the population). Among European-born women, HCV prevalence was associated with birth in continental Europe, partner not being notified at birth registration, partner born in a different region to the mother, and inner city residence. Four of the 241 anti-HCV positive samples (1.7%) were also anti-HIV-1 positive. It was estimated that each year an estimated 1150 out of 730 000 pregnancies in the UK would involve a woman infected with HCV (uncertainty range 660-1850), a prevalence of 0.16% (0.09-0.25%). On the basis of reported rates of mother-to-child transmission of HCV, this would represent approximately 70 paediatric HCV infections per year.

   immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in African women: Opportunities
   for intervention
AB Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are cofactors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, but the specific role of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is unclear. This study aimed to examine the in vivo relationships between HSV-2 and HIV-1 in 300 women in Bangui, Central African Republic. Sera were tested for syphilis, HIV-1, HSV-2 antibody, and levels of vitamins A and E. Genital specimens were tested for other STDs, HSV-2 DNA and HIV-1 RNA were quantified in cervicovaginal lavage. The prevalences of HSV-2 antibody (91% vs. 78%, P = .02), HSV-2 shedding (43% vs. 22%, P = .003), and levels of HSV-2 DNA (P = .01) were all significantly higher among HIV-1-seropositive than among HIV-1-seronegative women. There was a significant correlation between genital HIV-1 RNA and HSV-2 DNA levels (P = .02) among the 23 women who were shedding HSV-2 DNA. If confirmed, such associations highlight the urgent need for HSV-2 control measures in populations at high risk of both infections.

   and fungi in mice deficient in myeloperoxidase
AB Myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is located within neutrophils capable of producing hypochlorous acid, is active in vitro against bacteria and fungi. However, MPO-deficient persons are usually healthy. To define the in vivo contribution of MPO to early host defense against pulmonary infections, MPO-deficient and control mice were intranasally infected with various fungi and bacteria, and the number of residual microorganisms in lungs was compared 48 h later. MPO-deficient mice showed severely reduced cytotoxicity to Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichosporon asahii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the mutant mice showed a slight but significantly delayed clearance of Aspergillus fumigatus and klebsiella pneumoniae and had comparable levels of resistance to the wild type against Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These results suggest that the MPO-dependent oxidative system is important for host defense against fungi and bacteria, although the effect varies by pathogen species.

TI Wolbachia-induced 'hybrid breakdown' in the two-spotted spider mite
   Tetranychus urticae Koch
AB The most common post-zygotic isolation mechanism between populations of the phytophagous mite Tetranychus urticae is 'hybrid breakdown', i.e. when individuals from two different populations are crossed, F-1 hybrid females are produced, but F-1 recombinant male offspring suffer increased mortality. Two-spotted spider mites collected from two populations, one on rose and the other on cucumber plants, were infected with Wolbachia bacteria. These bacteria may induce cytoplasmic incompatibility in their hosts: uninfected (U) females become reproductively incompatible with infected (W) males. We report on the effect of Wolbachia infections in intra- and interstrain crosses on (i) F-1 mortality and sex ratios (a test for cytoplasmic incompatibility), and (ii) the number of haploid offspring and mortality in clutches of F-1 virgins (a test for hybrid breakdown). U x W crosses within the rose strain exhibited partial cytoplasmic incompatibility. More interestingly F-2 males suffered increased mortality, a result identical to the hybrid breakdown phenomenon. The experiments were repeated using females from the cucumber strain. In interstrain U x W and U x U crosses, hybrid breakdown was much stronger in the former (80 versus 26%). This is the first report of a Wolbachia infection causing a hybrid breakdown phenotype. Our results show that Wolbachia infections can contribute to reproductive incompatibility between populations of T. urticae.

TI The cause of parasitic infection in natural populations of Daphnia
   (Crustacea : Cladocera): the role of host genetics
AB Disease patterns in nature may be determined by genetic variation for resistance or by factors, genetic or environmental, which influence the host-parasite encounter rate. Elucidating the cause of natural infection patterns has been a major pursuit of parasitologists, but it also matters for evolutionary biologists because host resistance genes must influence the expression of disease if parasite-mediated selection is to occur. We used a model system in order to disentangle the strict genetic component from other causes of infection in the wild. Using the crustacean Daphnia magna and its sterilizing bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa, we tested whether genetic variation for resistance, as determined under controlled conditions, accounted for the distribution of infections within natural populations Specifically, we compared whether the clonally produced great-granddaughters of those individuals that were infected in held samples (but were subsequently 'cured' with antibiotics) were more susceptible than were the great-granddaughters of those individuals that were healthy in field samples. High doses of parasite spores led to increased infection in all four study populations, indicating the importance of encounter rate. Host genetics appeared to be irrelevant to natural infection patterns in one population. However, in three other populations hosts that were healthy in the field had greater genetic-based resistance than hosts that were infected in the field, unambiguously showing the effect of host genetic factors on the expression of disease in the wild.

AB Feline panleucopenia virus (FPLV) was introduced in 1977 on Marion Island (in the southern Indian Ocean) with the aim of eradicating the: cat population and provoked a huge decrease in the host population within six years. The virus can be transmitted either directly through contacts between infected and healthy cats or Indirectly between a healthy cat and the contaminated environment: a specific Feature of the virus is its high rate of survival outside the host. In this paper, a model was designed in order to take these two modes of transmission into account. The results showed that a mass-action incidence assumption was more appropriate than a proportionate mixing one in describing the dynamics of direct transmission. Under certain conditions the virus was able to control the host population at a low density The indirect transmission acted as a reservoir supplying the host population with a low but sufficient density of infected individuals which allowed the virus to persist. The dynamics of the infection were more affected by the demographic parameters of the health) boats than by the: epidemiological ones. Thus, demographic parameters should be precisely measured in field studies in order to obtain accurate predictions. The predicted results of our model were in good agreement with observations.

AB Models and empirical studies on host selection in plant-insect, algae-amphipod, host-parasite and prey-predator systems assume that oviposition preference is determined by the quality of the oviposition site for offspring development. According to the oviposition-preference-offspring-performance hypothesis, oviposition-preference hierarchy should correspond to host suitability for offspring development because females maximize their fitness by optimizing offspring performance. We show, we believe for the first time, that adult feeding site and related adult performance may explain most of the variation in adult feeding and oviposition site selection of an oligophagous grass miner, Chromatomyia nigra (Diptera). This study advances our understanding of the complex interactions between plants and herbivores because it shows that bust-preference patterns are not only shaped by the optimization of offspring performance, as previously assumed, but also by the optimization of adult performance.

TI The effect of parasites on host population density and extinction:
   Experimental epidemiology with Daphnia and six microparasites
AB Parasites have been shown to reduce host density and to induce host population extinction in some cases but not in others. Epidemiological models suggest that variable effects of parasites on individual hosts can explain this variability on the population level. Here, we aim to support this hypothesis with a specific epidemiological model using a cross-parasite species approach. We compared the effect of six parasites on host fecundity and survival to their effects on density and risk of extinction of clonal host populations. We contrast our empirical results of population density with predictions from a deterministic model and contrast our empirical results of host and parasite extinction rates with those predicted by a stochastic model. Five horizontally transmitted microparasites (two bacteria: white bacterial disease, Pasteuria ramosa; two microsporidia: Glugoides intestinalis, Ordospora colligata; one fungus: Metschnikowiella biscuspidata); and six strains of a vertically transmitted microsporidium (Flabelliforma magnivora) of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna were used. In life table experiments, we quantified fecundity and survival in individual parasitized and healthy hosts and compared these with the effect of the parasites on host population density and on the likelihood of host population extinction in microcosm populations. Parasite species varied strongly in their effects on host fecundity, host survival, host density reduction, and the frequency with which they drove host populations to extinction. The fewer offspring an infected host produced, the lower the density of an infected host population. This effect on host density was relatively stronger for the vertically transmitted parasite strains than for the horizontally transmitted parasites. As predicted by the stochastic simulations, strong effects of a parasite on individual host survival and fecundity increased the risk of host population extinction. The same was true for parasite extinctions. Our results have implications for the use of microparasites in biological control programs and for the role parasites play in driving small populations to extinction.

An analysis was done of all children who were screened for school fitness during 1996-1998 in Ulm, Germany, to compare rates of diarrheal illnesses in Ii. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative children. Of 2477 5-8-year-old children studied, 304 (12.3%) were H. pylori-positive by carbon 13-labeled urea breath test. For Ii. pylori-positive children, diarrhea within the prior 3 months was less often reported than for Il. pylori-negative children (54.3% vs. 76.1%; P < .001, adjusted for nationality). Compared with H. pylori-negative children, the odds ratio (OR) for the occurrence of diarrhea within the prior 3 months was 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.49) for N. pylori-positive children; after adjustment for covariates, the OR was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.42-0.76). These data support the hypothesis that Ii. pylori colonization may protect against diarrheagenic gastrointestinal infections.

   Chaco Province, Argentina
AB Host genetic factors, such as HLA alleles, are important in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and its progression to AIDS. HLA class I gene products are involved in peptide presentation, and each allele is responsible for presenting a different set of peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, The increase or decrease in the frequency of certain alleles in HIV-1-positive versus control subjects would suggest that alleles play a role in susceptibility to or protection against this viral infection. In the present study, 56 HIV-1-positive patients in Chaco Province, Argentina, were typed for the HLA-A and HLA-B loci, using polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The frequency of alleles A*24, B*18, and B*39 was increased in HIV-1-positive subjects, suggesting that these alleles play a role in susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Alleles B*44 and B*55 were not found in HIV-1-positive subjects, suggesting that they have a protective effect against the disease. The P values of the alleles B*39 and B*44 were statistically significant (P < .05).

TI Bottlenecks and multiple introductions: population genetics of the
   vector of avian malaria in Hawaii
AB Avian malaria has had a profound impact on the demographics and behaviour of Hawaiian forest birds since its vector, Culex quinquefasciatus the southern house mosquito, was first introduced to Hawaii around 1830. In order to understand the dynamics of the disease in Hawaii and gain insights into the evolution of vector-mediated parasite-host interactions in general we studied the population genetics of Cx. Quinquefasciatus in the Hawaiian Islands. We used both microsatellite and mitochondrial loci. Not surprisingly we found that mosquitoes in Midway, a small island in the Western group, are quite distinct from the populations in the main Hawaiian Islands. However, we also found that in general mosquito populations are relatively isolated even among the main islands, in particular between Hawaii (the Big Island) and the remaining Hawaiian Islands. We found evidence of bottlenecks among populations within the Big Island and an excess of alleles in Maul, the site of the original introduction. The mitochondrial diversity was typically low but higher than expected. The current distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes combined with the microsatellite information lead us to conclude that there have been several introductions and to speculate on some processes that may be responsible for the current population genetics of vectors of avian malaria in Hawaii.

TI Host-parasite coevolution in a multilocus gene-for-gene system
AB This paper examines a mathematical model for the coevolution of parasite virulence and host resistance under a multilocus gene-for-gene interaction. The degrees of parasite virulence and host resistance show coevolutionary cycles for sufficiently small costs of virulence and resistance. Besides these coevolutionary cycles of a longer period, multilocus genotype frequencies show complex fluctuations over shorter periods. All multilocus genotypes are maintained within host and parasite classes having the same number of resistant/virulent alleles and their frequencies fluctuate with approximately equally displaced phases. If either the cost of virulence or the number of resistance loci is larger then a threshold, the host maintains the static polymorphism of singly (or doubly or more, depending on the cost of resistance) resistant genotypes and the parasite remains universally avirulent. In other words, host polymorphism can prevent the invasion of any virulent strain in the parasite. Thus, although assuming an empirically common type of asymmetrical gene-for-gene interaction, both host and parasite populations can maintain polymorphism in each locus and retain complex fluctuations. Implications for the red queen hypothesis of the evolution of sex and the control of multiple drug resistance are discussed.

AB In many cities, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 seroprevalence among drug injectors stabilizes at 30-70% for many years without secondary outbreaks that increase seroprevalence by 15% or more. The authors considered how HIV-1 incidence can remain moderate at seroprevalence levels that would give maximum incidence. Previously suggested answers include behavioral risk reduction and network saturation within high-risk subgroups. Among 767 drug injectors studied in 1991-1993, during a period of stable high seroprevalence in New York City, risk behaviors remained common, and networks were far from saturated. The authors suggest a different network-based mechanism: in stable high-prevalence situations, the relatively small sizes of subnetworks of linked seronegatives (within larger networks containing both infected and uninfected persons) may limit infectious outbreaks. Any primary infection outbreak would probably be limited to members of connected subcomponents of seronegatives, and the largest such subcomponent in the study contained only 18 members (of 415 seronegatives). Research and mathematical modeling should study conditions that may affect the size and stability of subcomponents of seronegatives. Finally, if the existence of small, connected components of seronegatives prevents secondary outbreaks, this protection may weaken, and vulnerability to new outbreaks increase, if HIV-1 seroprevalence falls. Thus, in situations of declining prevalence, prevention programs should be maintained or strengthened.

TI Species concepts and malaria parasites: detecting a cryptic species of
   Plasmodium
AB Species of malaria parasite (phylum Apicomplexa: genus Plasmodium) have traditionally been described using the similarity species concept (based primarily on differences in morphological or life-history characteristics). The biological species concept (reproductive isolation) and phylogenetic species concept (based on monophyly) have not been used before in defining species of Plasmodium. Plasmodium azurophilum, described from Anolis lizards in the eastern Caribbean, is actually a two-species cryptic complex. The parasites were studied from eight islands, from Puerto Rico in the north to Grenada in the south. Morphology of the two species is very similar (differences are indistinguishable to the eye) but one infects only erythrocytes and the other only white blood cells. Molecular data for the cytochrome b gene reveal that the two forms are reproductively isolated; distinct haplotypes are present on each island and are never shared between the erythrocyte-infecting and leucocyte-infecting species. Each forms a monophyletic lineage indicating that they diverged before becoming established in the anoles of the eastern Caribbean. This comparison of the similarity, biological and phylogenetic species concepts for malaria parasites reveals the limited value of using only similarity measures in defining protozoan species.

TI The prevalence and genetic diversity of hepatitis C infection in
   antenatal clinic attenders in two regions of England
AB The prevalence and genetic diversity of hepatitis C infection in women attending antenatal clinics in two regions of England was investigated to inform future surveillance and control measures. Women booking into antenatal care are routinely offered a test for immunity to rubella. Serum residues from these tests were unlinked, anonymized and archived as part of the Unlinked Anonymous Prevalence Monitoring Programme (UAPMP). The serum specimens were tested for anti-HCV using a cost-effective pooling strategy. After taking into account differential sampling from the UAPMP serum archive, the adjusted overall prevalence of anti-HCV was 0.43% (95% CI: 0.32-0.53) in London and 0.21% (95% CI: 0.14-0.28) in the Northern and Yorkshire region. Restriction fragment length polymorphism of amplified HCV RNA identified type 3a as the most common HCV genotype in these antenatal women. The prevalence of anti-HCV in antenatal women in the UK is low and consistent with that expected from injecting drug use.

TI Immune defence reaction in bumble-bee workers after a previous challenge
   and parasitic coinfection
AB 1. A successful immune response requires the functioning of a range of physiological mechanisms and is therefore supposed to be costly in terms of limited resources that could be used otherwise, such as energy or nutrients. Because immunity is costly, immune defence should be reduced if appropriate multiple immunogenic challenges are present.
   2. The working hypothesis that multiple challenges will reduce the immune system's capacity to respond is adopted. An existing infection by yet another parasite could also further reduce the strength of the immune response, since limited resources have to be divided among the different challenges.
   3. The bumble-bee, Bombus terrestris L., and its parasites are used as a model system to study (1) whether the melanization response towards an antigen is reduced or increased after a preceding challenge ('depletion/stimulation'); (2) if depletion occurs, how long it takes to mount a full defence response against the second challenge; and (3) whether the coinfection by another parasite reduces or increases the immune defence system's capacity to respond. A standard technique was used where two novel antigens (nylon filaments of different sizes and time intervals) were implanted into the haemocoel of individual workers. Controls were individuals implanted with a single fixed sized implant. A gut parasite, the trypanosome Crithidia bombi, was used for coinfections.
   4. Size of the implant had no effect on the melanization response as well as time between primary and secondary implant. Primary and secondary implants differed from the controls. In particular, the primary implant was melanized more intensively than the controls and secondary, respectively. Furthermore, a coinfection by C. bombi had no effect on the encapsulation response.
   5. The results suggest that no general depletion of the encapsulation system occurs under the conditions of our experiment and that a similar immune response (melanization) independent on the magnitude of the challenge, occurs. However, there seems to be a depletion effect on the secondary implant. Furthermore, the dynamics of two different parasites seem to run independently as far as within-host interactions are concerned.

TI Virus-vectored immunocontraception to control feral cats on islands: a
   mathematical model
AB 1. Feral cats Felis catus introduced onto oceanic islands pose a major ecological threat to endemic vertebrates, but their control is difficult. Immunocontraception has not been considered previously as a method for their control or eradication, and therefore we used a modelling approach to assess whether virus-vectored immunocontraception (VVIC) might be effective.
   2. We compared the relative efficiency of cat control:eradication using immunocontraception and three different disseminating techniques, i.e. baits, genetically modified viral vectors, or both. We accounted for several forms of dynamic compensation likely to arise in a population with artificially reduced fertility.
   3. We conclude that, under the assumptions of our model, immunocontraception can control or eradicate feral cats on oceanic islands. VVIC was found to be a more efficient dissemination technique than baits, but an integrated method involving viral-infected baits was the most likely to lead to eradication.
   4. We advocate field trials of this VVIC technique, when available, under island conditions where any risks to non-target fauna would be minimal.

TI Biological control using sterilizing viruses: host suppression and
   competition between viruses in nonspatial models
AB 1. Research is currently underway to develop genetically engineered viruses that can sterilize pest animals. The technique, known as viral-vectored immunocontraception (VVIC), promises to control mammalian pests such as the European rabbit, the house mouse and domestic cats.
   2. Using host-parasite models we explored the degree of control of the host population that can be attained when hosts that recover from infection become permanently infertile. The models assume some demographic compensation for reduced fertility in the host population, and are tailored to address issues raised by the use of the myxoma virus as an agent to sterilize rabbits. A 'pay-off' function is developed, which defines the degree to which host density is suppressed by a sterilizing agent.
   3. The results show that sterilizing viruses can reduce host abundance, and that hosts with low birth rates and moderate mortality rates are the best targets for VVIC. High transmissibility increases the pay-off from VVIC, but because virulent parasites kill most of the hosts that they infect, the pay-off is highest if benign parasites are used as the vector of contraceptive antigens. We argue that appropriate pay-off functions should be developed as a basis for research and development on genetically modified organisms.
   4. The host-parasite models are extended to include a competing strain of virus that does not sterilize the host. We analysed these models using a general approach to the analysis of competition, which has not often been applied to epidemiological models. The extended model shows that host sterilization per se does not affect the competitive ability of viruses, a result that applies to a broad class of models in which the per capita growth rates of competing parasites are linear functions of limiting competitive factors.

TI Modelling the spatial dynamics of parapoxvirus disease in red and grey
   squirrels: a possible cause of the decline in the red squirrel in the
   UK?
AB 1. A stochastic individual-based model for simulating the dynamics of an infectious disease in sympatric red and grey squirrel populations is described. The model simulates the spread of parapoxvirus between squirrels in fragmented populations based on the dispersal of infected animals. the probability of encounters between individuals, exposure to the virus and subsequent mortality.
   2. The disease model was integrated with a spatially explicit population dynamics model that simulated red and grey squirrel populations in real landscapes, using habitat information held in a geographical information system. Latin hypercube sampling was used to create a range of realistic life-history and infection scenarios and the model was used to investigate the dynamics of red and grey squirrels in Norfolk between 1966 and 1980.
   3. The model predicted that parapoxvirus, like interspecific competition, could have led to the extinction of the red squirrel in Norfolk. The results suggest that the red squirrel-grey squirrel-parapoxvirus interaction represents a system of apparent competition mediated by an infectious agent, as seen in other interactions between resident and exotic species.
   4. The need for further epidemiological research on the virus is emphasized. We believe that the combined effects on disease transmission of habitat, behaviour and grey squirrels acting as reservoir hosts will lead to a patchy prevalence and sporadic incidence of parapoxvirus disease in red squirrels and a more rapid local replacement by grey squirrels.
   5. These results have implications for conservation management of the red squirrel in the UK. Schemes in which animals are translocated or given supplementary feeding may enhance disease spread by bringing infected animals into contact with others.

   type 1 infection and perinatal transmission in Bangkok, Thailand
AB The effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 on the placenta and the role of the placenta in mother-to-child HIV-I transmission are not well understood. Placentas from 78 HIV-infected and 158 HIV-uninfected women were examined as part of a prospective perinatal HIV transmission study in Bangkok. HIV-infected women were more likely than HIV-uninfected women to have chorioamnionitis (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; P = .03), placental membrane inflammation (PMI; OR, 2.7; P = .02), and deciduitis (OR, 2.3; P = .03) and less likely to have villitis (OR, 0.3; P = .02). However, among HIV-infected women, fewer women who transmitted infection to their child had chorioamnionitis (relative risk [RR], 0.2; P = .03), funisitis (RR, 0.4; P = .1), or PMI (RR undefined; P = .03). These findings suggest that, in this population, HIV-infected women are at increased risk for placental membrane inflammatory lesions, but that placental inflammatory lesions are not associated with increased perinatal HIV transmission.

TI Are avian blood parasites pathogenic in the wild? A medication
   experiment in blue tits (Parus caeruleus)
AB The Hamilton and Zuk hypothesis on haemoparasite-mediated sexual selection and certain studies of reproductive costs are based on the assumption that avian blood parasite infections are detrimental to their hosts. However, there is no experimental evidence demonstrating harmful effects of blood parasites on fitness in. wild populations, it even having been suggested that they may be non-pathogenic. Only an experimental manipulation of natural blood parasite loads may reveal their harmful effects. In this field experiment we reduced through medication the intensity of infection by Haemoproteus majoris and the prevalence or infection by Leucocytozoon majoris in blue tits (Parus caeruleus), and demonstrated detrimental effects of natural levels of infection by these common parasite species on host reproductive success and condition. The fact that some of the costs of infection were paid by offspring indicates that blood parasites reduce parental working capacity while feeding nestlings. Medicated females may be able to devote more resources to parental care through being released from the drain imposed upon them by parasites and/or through a reduced allocation Co an immune response. Therefore, this work adds support to previous findings relating hosts' life-history traits and haematozoan infections.

TI A mechanistic link between parasite resistance and expression of a
   sexually selected trait in a damselfly
AB This paper examines a held-based insect system in which a signal trait and an immune effector system responsible for parasite resistance rely on the same melanin-producing enzyme cascade (phenoloxidase, PO). Observations and experiments on males of the calopterygid damselfly Calopteryx splendens xanthostoma revealed that resistance to the prevalent parasite in the study system (a eugregarine protozoan infecting the mid-gut) was correlated with quantitative aspects of the sexually dimorphic melanized wingspot of males, a trait that is produced and fixed before the host comes into contact with the sporozoites of the parasite. Regulation of PO during experimental immune challenge showed that males with dark, homogenous melanin distribution in their wings showed no change in PO levels 24 h after challenge. By contrast males with lighter and/or more heterogenous melanin distribution in their wings tended to show higher PO levels 24 h after immune challenge. The changes in PO levels occur despite the lack of a relationship between wing-pigment distribution and the cellular encapsulation response. These results suggest a shared, limiting resource may form the mechanistic basis of the trade-off between a condition-dependent signal trait and immune function in this system.

TI The ears of the hippopotamus: Manifestations, determinants, and
   estimates of the malaria burden
AB Malarious patients experience asymptomatic parasitemia; acute febrile illness (with cerebral damage, anemia, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia); chronic debilitation (anemia, malnutrition, nervous system-related sequelae); and complications of pregnancy (anemia, low birth weight, increased infant mortality). These manifestations in patients, communities, and countries reflect intrinsic (human, parasite, mosquito) and extrinsic (environmental, social, behavioral, political, and economic conditions as well as disease-control efforts) determinants. At a minimum, between 700,000 and 2.7 million persons die yearly from malaria, over 75% of them African children. Between 400 and 900 million acute febrile episodes occur yearly in African children under 5 yr of age living in endemic areas. Although about half of these children are parasitemic, all merit consideration of malaria-specific therapy, which is becoming more problematic because of parasite resistance to drugs. These numbers will more than double over the next 20 yr without effective control. Fewer than 20% of these febrile episodes and deaths come to the attention of any formal health system. The relatively few ill patients who have any contact with the health services represent the "ears of the hippopotamus." Greatly intensified research activities and control of the intolerable burden of malaria are mandatory if economic development is to accelerate in Africa. In particular, support should be targeted to understanding and preventing malaria-induced anemia, hypoglycemia, effects on pregnancy, and neurologic and developmental impairment. To decrease and stop transmission of this intolerable scourge, there is an urgent need for malaria vaccines, newer drugs, and better vector control methods as well as the ability to improve current technologies and use them more efficiently.

TI The public health impact of chloroquine resistance in Africa
AB Between 1978 and 1988 Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine has been reported in all countries of tropical Africa. Despite the intensification of resistance during the last 2 decades, chloroquine remains in 2000 the first-line treatment for malaria in most of these countries. Here we review published data on the public health impact of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. These data show that since the late 1980s convincing evidence of a major public health impact of the spread of chloroquine resistance has been available. Hospital studies in various African countries have documented a 2- or 3-fold increase in malaria deaths and admissions for severe malaria, an increase temporally related to the emergence of chloroquine resistance. Data from sentinel demographic surveillance systems in Senegal indicated that mortality attributable to malaria in children increased by as much as 6-fold among populations where low levels of malaria mortality had been achieved because of efficient health services before the emergence of chloroquine resistance, Increasing incidence of severe malarial anemia also contributed to human immunodeficiency virus dissemination. The dramatic impact of chloroquine resistance on malaria mortality has long been underestimated because only a low proportion of malaria attacks are potentially lethal among persons continuously exposed since birth to high levels of transmission. There is an urgent need to change treatment policies in Africa.

TI The burden of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic areas
AB Pregnant women in malarious areas may experience a variety of adverse consequences from malaria infection including maternal anemia, placental accumulation of parasites, low birth weight (LBW) from prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), fetal parasite exposure and congenital infection, and infant mortality (IM) linked to preterm-LBW and IUGR-LBW. We reviewed studies between 1985 and 2000 and summarized the malaria population attributable risk (PAR) that accounts for both the prevalence of the risk factors in the population and the magnitude of the associated risk for anemia, LBW, and IM. Consequences from anemia and human immunodeficiency virus infection in these studies were also considered. Population attributable risks were substantial: malaria was associated with anemia (PAR range = 3-15%, LEW (8-14%), preterm-LBW (8-36%), IUGR-LBW (13-70%), and IM (3-8%). Human immunodeficiency virus was associated with anemia (PAR range = 12-14%), LEW (11-38%), and direct transmission in 20-40% of newborns, with direct mortality consequences. Maternal anemia was associated with LEW (PAR range = 7-18%). and fetal anemia was associated with increased IM (PAR not available). We estimate that each year 75,000 to 200,000 infant deaths are associated with malaria infection in pregnancy. The failure to apply known effective antimalarial interventions through antenatal programs continues to contribute substantially to infant deaths globally.

TI The neglected burden of Plasmodium vivax malaria
AB We estimate that the global burden of malaria due to Plasmodium vivax is similar to 70-80 million cases annually. Probably similar to 10-20% of the world's cases of P. vivax infection occur in Africa, south of the Sahara. In eastern and southern Africa, P. vivax represents around 10% of malaria cases but < 1% of cases in western and central Africa. Outside of African, P. vivax accounts for > 50% of all malaria cases. About 80-90% of P. vivax outside of Africa occurs in the Middle East, Asia, and the Western Pacific, mainly in the most tropical regions, and 10-15% in Central and South America. Because malaria transmission rates are low in most regions where P. vivax is prevalent, the human populations affected achieve little immunity to this parasite; as a result, in these regions, P. vivax infections affect people of all ages. Although the effects of repeated attacks of P. vivax through childhood and adult life are only rarely directly lethal, they can have major deleterious effects on personal well-being, growth, and development, and on the economic performance at the individual, family, community, and national levels. Features of the transmission biology of P. vivax give this species greater resilience than the less robust Plasmodium falciparum,arum in the face of conditions adverse to the transmission of the parasites. Therefore, as control measures become more effective, the residual malaria burden is likely increasingly to become that of P. vivax.

TI Epidemiology, evolution, and future of the HIV/AIDS pandemic
AB We used mathematical models to address several questions concerning the epidemiologic and evolutionary future of HIV/AIDS in human populations. Our analysis suggests that 1) when HIV first enters a human population, and for many subsequent years, the epidemic is driven by early transmissions, possibly occurring before donors have seroconverted to HIV-positive status; 2) new HIV infections in a subpopulation (risk group) may decline or level off due to the saturation of the susceptible hosts rather than to evolution of the virus or to the efficacy of intervention, education, and public health measures; 3) evolution in humans for resistance to HIV infection or for the infection to engender a lower death rate will require thousands of years and will be achieved only after vast numbers of persons die of AIDS; 4) evolution is unlikely to increase the virulence of HIV; and 5) if HIV chemotherapy reduces the transmissibility of the virus, treating individual patients can reduce the frequency of HIV infections and AIDS deaths in the general population.

TI Antibacterial household products: Cause for concern
AB The recent entry of products containing antibacterial agents into healthy households has escalated from a few dozen products in the mid-1990s to more than 700 today. Antibacterial products were developed and have been successfully used to prevent transmission of disease-causing microorganisms among patients, particularly in hospitals. They are now being added to products used in healthy households, even though an added health benefit has not been demonstrated. Scientists are concerned that the antibacterial agents will select bacteria resistant to them and cross-resistant to antibiotics. Moreover, if they alter a person's microflora, they may negatively affect the normal maturation of the T helper cell response of the immune system to commensal flora antigens; this change could lead to a greater chance of allergies in children. As with antibiotics, prudent use of these products is urged. Their designated purpose is to protect vulnerable patients.

TI Evolutionary adaptation to temperature. VII. Effects of temperature on
   growth rate in natural isolates of Escherichia coli and Salmonella
   enterica from different thermal environments
AB Are enteric bacteria specifically adapted to the thermal environment of their hosts? In particular, do the optimal temperatures and thermal niches of the bacterial flora reflect seasonal, geographic, or phylogenetic differences in their hosts' temperatures? We examined these questions by measuring the relationship between the temperature-dependent growth rates of enteric bacteria in a free-living ectothermic host. We sampled two species of enteric bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) from three natural populations of slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) seasonally over two years. Despite pronounced differences in turtle body temperatures at different seasons and in different locations, we found no evidence that the thermal growth profiles of these bacteria mirrored this variation. Optimal temperatures and maximal growth rates in rich medium were nearly the same for both bacterial species (35-36 degreesC, 2.5 doublings per hour). The thermal niche (defined as the range of temperatures over which 75% of maximal growth rate occurred) was slightly higher for E. coli (28.5-41.0 degreesC) than for S. enterica (27.7-39.8 degreesC), but the niche breadth was about the same for both. We also measured the thermal dependence of growth rate in these same bacterial species isolated from mammalian hosts. Both bacterial species had temperatures of maximal growth and thermal niches that were about 2 degreesC higher than those of their respective conspecifics sampled from turtle; niche breadths were not different. These data suggest that these bacterial species are thermal generalists that do not track fine-scale changes in their thermal environments. Even major differences in body temperatures, as great as those between ectothermic and endothermic hosts, may result in the evolution of rather modest changes in thermal properties.

TI Phylogeography of Caribbean lizard malaria: tracing the history of
   vector-borne parasites
AB The Anolis lizards of the eastern Caribbean islands are parasitized by several species of malaria parasites (Plasmodium). Here I focus on two species of Plasmodium, using molecular data (mitochondrial, cytochrome b sequences) to recover the phylogeography of the parasites throughout the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico. The two parasites were originally described as a single species, P. azurophilum, which infects both red and white blood cells. Here the two species are termed P. azurophilum Red and P. azurophilum White based on their host cell type. Six haplotypes were found in 100 infections sequenced of P. azurophilum Red and six in 45 infections of P. azurophilum White. Nested clade analysis revealed a significant association of geographical location and clades as well as a pattern of past fragmentation of parasite populations. This is consistent with the hypothesis that vector-borne parasites such as malaria may be subject to frequent local extinctions and recolonizations. Comparison of the phylogeography of the lizard and parasites shows only weak concordance; chat is, the parasites colonized the lizards in the islands, but dispersal events between islands via vectors or failed lizard colonizations were present. The two parasites had different histories, P. azurophilum Red colonized the islands from bath the noah and south, and P. azurophilum White originated in the central Lesser Antilles, probably from P. azurophilum Red, then moved to both north and south. This is the first study to examine the biogeography of a pair of sibling species of vector-borne parasites within an island archipelago system.

TI Parthenogenetic flatworms have more symbionts than their coexisting,
   sexual conspecifics, but does this support the Red Queen?
AB The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sexuality is favoured when virulent parasites adapt quickly to host genotypes. We studied a population of the flatworm Schmidtea polychroa in which obligate sexual and parthenagenetic individuals coexist. Infection rates by an amoeboid protozoan were consistently higher in parthenogens than in sexuals. Allozyme analysis showed that infection was genotype specific, with the second most common clone most infected. A laboratory measurement of fitness components failed to reveal high infection costs as required for the Red Queen. Although fertility was lower in more infected parthenogens, this effect can also be explained by the accumulation of mutations. We discuss these and other characteristics of our model system that may explain how a parasite with low virulence can show this pattern.

TI The genetic architecture of disease resistance in plants and the
   maintenance of recombination by parasites
AB Parasites represent strong selection on host populations because they are ubiquitous and can drastically reduce host fitness. It has been hypothesized that parasite selection could explain the widespread occurrence of recombination because it is a coevolving force that favours new genetic combinations in the host. A review of deterministic models for the maintenance of recombination reveals that for recombination to be favoured, multiple genes that interact with each other must be under selection. To evaluate whether parasite selection can explain the maintenance of recombination, we review 85 studies that investigated the genetic architecture of plant disease resistance and discuss whether they conform to the requirements that emerge from theoretical models. General characteristics of disease resistance in plants and problems in evaluating resistance experimentally are also discussed. We found strong evidence that disease resistance in plants is determined by multiple loci. Furthermore, in most cases where loci were tested for interactions, epistasis between loci that affect resistance was found. However, we found weak support for the idea that specific allelic combinations determine resistance to different host genotypes and there was little data on whether epistasis between resistance genes is negative or positive. Thus, the current data indicate that it is possible that parasite selection can favour recombination, but more studies in natural populations that specifically address the nature of the interactions between resistance genes are necessary. The data summarized here suggest that disease resistance is a complex trait and that environmental effects and fitness trade-offs should be considered in future models of the coevolutionary dynamics of host and parasites.

TI The social evolution of bacterial pathogenesis
AB Many of the genes responsible for the virulence of bacterial pathogens are carried by mobile genetic elements that can be transferred horizontally between different bacterial lineages. Horizontal transfer of virulence-factor genes has pla)red a profound role in the evolution of bacterial pathogens, but it is poorly understood why these genes are so often mobile. Here, I present a hypothetical selective mechanism maintaining virulence-factor genes on horizontally transmissible genetic elements. For virulence factors that are secreted extracellularly, selection within hosts may favour mutant 'cheater' strains of the pathogen that do not produce the virulence factor themselves but still benefit from factors produced by other members of the pathogen population within a host. Using simple mathematical models, I show that if this occurs then selection for infectious transmission between hosts favours pathogen strains that can reintroduce functional copies of virulence-factor genes into cheaters via horizontal transfer, forcing them to produce the virulence factor. Horizontal gene transfer is thus a novel mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. I discuss predictions of this hypothesis that can be tested empirically and its implications for the evolution of pathogen virulence.

TI An analysis of a presumed major outbreak of pseudorabies virus in a
   vaccinated sow herd
AB We describe a major outbreak of pseudorabies virus (PRV) in a sow herd in which the sows were vaccinated simultaneously three times a year with a vaccine containing Bartha strain. Also in the associated rearing herd in which the gilts were vaccinated twice an outbreak of PRV occurred. The outbreak was analysed with mathematical models, statistical methods and Monte-Carlo simulation. Under the assumption that the outbreak started with one introduction of virus the reproduction ratio R-ind - as a measure of transmission of PRV between individuals-in the sow herd was estimated with a Generalized Linear Model to be 1.6. Also under the assumption of one introduction of virus Ri,, in the rearing herd was estimated with a martingale estimator to be 1.7. Both estimates were significantly larger than 1. Mathematical analysis showed that heterogeneity in the sow herd, because of the presence of not-optimally immunized replacement sows could not be the only cause of the observed outbreak in the sow herd. With Monte-Carlo simulations, the duration of an outbreak after a single introduction of virus and R-ind = 1.6 did not mimic the data and thus the hypothesis of a single introduction with R-ind = 1.6 could also be rejected and R-ind is thus, not necessarily above 1. Moreover, with statistical analysis, endemicity in the combination of herds as a cause for the observed outbreak could be rejected. Endemicity in the rearing herd alone could not be excluded. Therefore, multiple introductions from outside and most probably from the rearing herd were possibly the cause of the observed outbreak(s). The implications for eradication of pseudorabies virus were discussed.

TI Selection bias in epidemiological studies of infectious disease using
   Escherichia coli and avian cellulitis as an example
AB In epidemiological studies of infectious disease, researchers often rely on specific cues of the host, such as clinical signs, as surrogate indicators of pathogen presence. A selection bias would manifest if the specific visual cues used in sampling for the pathogen were not representative of the full range of signs caused by the strains of that pathogen. In our molecular epidemiological studies of Escherichia coli associated with avian cellulitis in broilers, we collect carcasses at the processing plant based on visual cues of lesion morphology. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: (1) explore the potential impacts of selection bias in an application of infectious disease epidemiology, and (2) utilize a validation protocol to assess the potential for selection bias in our molecular epidemiological studies of E. coli and avian cellulitis. In two different trials, E. coli DNA fingerprints were compared between birds that our observers collected and the birds that the observers missed. Using Fisher's exact tests and simulation models, we determined that the isolates collected by the observers were not significantly different from the isolates missed by the observers (P > 0.60 in both trials). Our method of selecting birds suspected of having cellulitis did not significantly bias our inferences about the population of E. coli associated with cellulitis in the flock. We encourage more investigators to critically assess the relationship of the sample to the target population in epidemiological studies of infectious disease.

AB We investigated the genetic population structure of the sexually transmitted plant pathogen, the fungus Microbotryum violaceum, on the two closely related host species Silene latifolia and S. dioica using microsatellite markers. We found strong deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations, with significant heterozygote deficiency in almost all populations. Fungal strains from the two host species were differentiated, and these host races differed in amount of variation within populations and differentiation among populations. Anther smut from S. latifolia harboured significantly less microsatellite diversity and were more genetically differentiated from each other than those from S. dioica. Small effective population sizes, rapid population turnover, and less gene flow among populations could lead to this higher population differentiation and lower within population genetic diversity for anther smut populations on S. latifolia than on S. dioica. These results are in concordance with host ecology because S. latifolia grows in more disturbed habitats than S. dioica and may provide a shorter-lived host environment.

AB Steady-slate levels of HIV-1 viraemia in the plasma vary more than a 1000-fold between HIV-positive patients and are thought to be influenced by several different host and viral factors such as host target cell availability, host anti-HIV immune response and the virulence of the virus. Previous mathematical models have taken the form of classical ecological food-chain models and are unable to account for this multifactorial nature of the disease. These models suggest that the steady-state viral load (i.e. the set-point) is determined by immune response parameters only. We have devised a generalized consensus model in which the conventional parameters are replaced by so-called 'process functions'. This very general approach yields results that are insensitive to the precise form of the mathematical model. Here we applied the approach to HIV-1 infections by estimating the steady-state values of several process functions from published patient data. Importantly, these estimates are generic because they are independent of the precise form of the underlying processes. We recorded the variation in the estimated steady-state values of the process functions in a group of HIV-1 patients. We developed a novel model by providing explicit expressions for the process functions having the highest patient-to-patient variation in their estimated values. Small variations from patient to patient for several parameters of the new model collectively accounted for the large variations observed in the steady-state viral burden. The novel model remains in full agreement with previous models and data.

TI The basic depression ratio of the host: the evolution of host resistance
   to microparasites
AB The basic reproduction ratio R-0 occupies a central position in the theory of host-pathogen interactions. However, this quantity stresses the role of the pathogen. This paper proposes an additional, more host-centred characterization using the basic depression ratio D-0 This quantity is the number of host individuals per infected which the infected host population is depressed below its uninfected level. This paper shows that a baseline criterion for the evolution of host resistance to microparasites is that resistance evolves to minimize D-0. This parallels the result for pathogen virulence where R-0 is maximized. The tension between these two criteria is noted. The framework established allows a discussion of tradeoffs between aspects of the pathogen-free host biology and the host-pathogen interaction. For certain linear and convex trade-offs it is shown that the strain with the lowest transmission parameter beta wins (despite the fact that it has the lowest intrinsic birth rate a). For corresponding concave trade-offs, either the strain with minimum beta and a or the strain with maximum beta and a wins. Finally, the connection with the techniques of adaptive dynamics is made. Evolutionary singular points are shown to occur at extrema of D-0. The evolutionary attainment of the results is discussed.

TI Productive infection of T cells in lymphoid tissues during primary and
   early human immunodeficiency virus infection
AB Current models suggest that during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission virions are selected that use the CCR5 chemokine receptor on macrophages and/or dendritic cells. A gradual evolution to CXCR4 chemokine receptor use causes a shift in the proportion of productively infected cells to the CD4 cell population. Productively infected cells during acute and early infection in lymphoid tissue were assessed, as well as the impact of productive infection on the T cell population in 21 persons who had biopsies performed on days 2-280 after symptoms of acute HIV-1 seroconversion. Even in the earliest stages of infection, most productively infected cells were T lymphocytes. There were sufficient infected cells in lymphoid tissue (LT) to account for virus production and virus load in plasma. Despite the relatively high frequency of productively infected cells in LT, the impact on the size of the T cell population in LT at this stage was minor.

TI Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte memory, virus clearance and antigenic
   heterogeneity
AB Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) memory to viruses has traditionally been studied in an isolated setting. However, recent experiments have indicated that the presence of antigenically heterologous challenges can result in the attrition of CTL memory Here we use mathematical models in order to explore the consequence of these dynamics for the ability of the immune system in controlling multiple infections. Mathematical models suggest that antigen-independent persistence of CTL memory is required in order to resolve and clear an infection. This ensures strong immunological pressure at low loads when the virus population declines towards extinction. If the number of antigenic stimuli exposed to the immune system crosses a threshold, we find that immunological pressure is significantly reduced at low loads and this can prevent virus clearance and reduces overall control of viral replication. Hence: exposure to many heterologous challenges reduces the ability of CTL memory to contribute to virus control. The higher the number of infections present in the host, the higher the overall virus load and the higher the total number of memory CTLs. Beyond a given threshold, addition of new viruses to the system results in accelerated loss of virus control which eventually leads to a reduction in the overall memory CTL population. These dynamics might contribute to the progressively weaker immunity observed as a result of ageing. In this context, antigenically variable pathogens expose the immune system to many heterologous challenges within a short period of time and this could result in accelerated ageing of the immune system. These results have important implications for vaccination and treatment strategies directed against viral infections.

TI Antibody to Sin Nombre virus in rodents associated with peridomestic
   habitats in west central Montana
AB Most human cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are acquired in the peridomestic environment, yet studies of the ecology and infection dynamics in the reservoir host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), have focused on sylvan populations. We describe a 2.5-year study of hantavirus infection in rodents associated with peridomestic habitats in west central Montana. Antibodies reactive with Sin Nombre virus (SNV) were found in five species. Overall SNV antibody prevalence was highest among deer mice (25% of individuals tested). As has been demonstrated for sylvan populations, the antibody-positive component of the deer mouse population consisted of a higher proportion of adults and males. However, the prevalence of antibodies to SNV was higher in this study than has been reported in most sylvan studies. The average monthly proportion of deer mouse blood samples with antibodies to SNV ranged from approximately 20% to 25% and was highest in the late spring/early summer. The higher SNV antibody prevalence in peridomestic compared with sylvan settings may be related to behavioral differences and/or potentially longer survival of the virus deposited inside buildings. Peridomestic settings presented higher concentrations of virus and may present a higher risk of human infection than do sylvan settings.

TI Hepatitis C and cirrhotic liver disease in the Nile delta of Egypt: A
   community-based study
AB Residents of Egypt's Nile river delta have among the world's highest seroprevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. To assess the impact of HCV on chronic liver disease, we studied the association between HCV, other hepatitis viruses, and cirrhotic liver disease in a cross-sectional, community-based survey of 801 persons aged greater than or equal to 10 years living in a semi-urban, Nile delta village. Residents were systematically sampled using questionnaires, physical examination, abdominal ultrasonography and serologically for antibodies to HCV (confirmed by a third-generation immunoblot assay) and to hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). The seroprevalence of HCV increased with age from 19% in persons 10-19 years old to about 60% in persons 30 years and older. Although no practices that might facilitate HCV transmission were discovered, the seroprevalence of HCV was significantly associated with remote (> 1 year) histories of schistosomiasis. Sonographic evidence of cirrhosis was present in 3% (95% CI: 1%, 4%) of the population (0.7% of persons under 30 years of age and in 5% of older persons), and was significantly associated with HCV seroreactivity. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that past mass parenteral chemotherapy campaigns for schistosomiasis facilitated HCV transmission, and that HCV may be a major cause of the high prevalence of liver cirrhosis in this Nile village.

TI Biodiversity and the dilution effect in disease ecology
AB Many infectious diseases of humans are caused by pathogens that reside in nonhuman animal reservoirs and are transmitted to humans via the bite of an arthropod vector Most vectors feed from a variety of host species that differ dramatically in their reservoir competence; that is, their probability of transmitting the infection from host to vector. We explore a conceptual model of what we termed the "dilution effect," whereby the presence of vertebrate hosts with a low capacity to infect feeding vectors (incompetent reservoirs) dilute the effect of highly competent reservoirs, thus reducing disease risk. Using Lyme disease as an example, we demonstrate the presence and estimate the magnitude of the dilution effect for local sites in eastern New York State. We found that the prevalence of Lyme disease spirochetes, Borrelia burgdorferi, in field-collected Ixodes ticks (37.6% and 70.5% for nymphal and adult stages, respectively) was dramatically lower than expected (similar to 90% and >95% for nymphal and adult stages, respectively) if ticks fed predominantly on highly competent reservoirs, white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). We inferred the role of additional host species using an empirically based model that incorporated data on tick burdens per host, relative population densities of hosts, and reservoir competence of each host. Assuming an empirically realistic reservoir competence of 5% for non-mouse and non-chipmunk hosts, we determined that alternative hosts must provide 61% and 72% of larval and nymphal meals, respectively. Using computer simulations, we assembled simulated host communities that differed in species richness, evenness, and net interactions between alternative hosts and mice. We found that increasing species richness (but not evenness) reduced disease risk. Effects were most pronounced when the most competent disease reservoirs were community dominants and when alternative hosts had a net negative influence on the dominance of mice as a host for ticks. Our results highlight a critical role of biodiversity and host community ecology in the transmission of vector-borne zoonotic diseases that in turn has important consequences for human health.

TI Propagule interactions and the evolution of virulence
AB The evolution of parasite virulence is thought to involve a trade-off between parasite reproductive rate and the effect of increasing the number of propagules on host survivorship. Such a trade-off should lead to selection for an intermediate level of within-host reproduction (lambda). Here I consider the effects of parasite propagule number on selection affecting lambda when (i) the effect of each propagule is independent of propagule number, and (ii) when the effect of each propagule changes as a function of propagule number. Virulence evolves in these models as a correlated response to selection on lambda. If each propagule has the same effect (s) as all previous propagules, the survivorship of infected hosts is reduced by more than 60% at equilibrium, independent of the value of s. If, instead, each propagule has a more negative effect on host survivorship than previous propagules, host survivorship at equilibrium is expected to increase as the effect becomes more pronounced. These results are directly parallel to results derived for population mean fitness at mutation-selection balance; and they suggest that high virulence should be associated with parasites for which the effect of adding propagules either remains constant or diminishes with propagule number.

TI Frequent and persistent, asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections
   in African infants, characterized by multilocus genotyping
AB To determine the duration and complexity of naturally acquired Plasmodium falciparum infections in small children, a longitudinal cohort study of 143 newborns was conducted in coastal Ghana. On average, children experienced 2 episodes of infection in their first 2 years of life, the median duration of an asymptomatic infection was <4 weeks, and estimates of the mean number of parasite genotypes per infection were 1.15-2.28. Nevertheless, 40% of the children experienced infections lasting <less than or equal to>12 weeks, and both the duration and complexity of infections increased with age. The longest period of continual infection was 64 weeks, and the maximum persistence of a single parasite genotype was 40 weeks. Thus, malaria infections in infants <5 months old tend to be asymptomatic and rapidly cleared; persistent asymptomatic parasitemia is more common in children >5 months old. The ability of very young children to clear or control malaria infections indicates the presence of effective innate or immune antiparasite mechanisms.

TI Issues in Public Health Entomology
AB Public health entomology focuses on the population biology of vector-borne infections, seeking to understand how such pathogens perpetuate over time and attempting to devise methods for reducing the burden that they impose on human health. As public health entomology passes its centennial, a series of pervasive research themes and spirited debates characterize the discipline, many reflecting a tension between field and laboratory research. In particular, institutional support for population-based research and training programs has fallen behind that for those using modern lab-based approaches. Discussion of modes of intervention against vector-borne infections (such as deployment of genetically modified vectors, the role of DDT in malaria control, host-targeted acaricides for Lyme disease risk reduction, and truck-mounted aerosol spraying against West Nile virus transmission) illustrates the discipline's need for strengthening population-based research programs. Even with the advent of molecular methods for describing population structure, the basis for anophelism without malaria (or its eastern North American counterpart, ixodism without borreliosis) remains elusive. Such methods have not yet been extensively used to examine the phylogeography and geographical origins of zoonoses such as Lyme disease. Basic ecological questions remain poorly explored: What regulates vector populations? How may mixtures of pathogens be maintained by a single vector? What factors might limit the invasion of Asian mosquitoes into North American sites? Putative effects of "global warming" remain speculative given our relative inability to answer such questions. Finally, policy and administrative issues such as the "no-nits" dictum in American schools, the Roll Back Malaria program, and legal liability for risk due to vector-borne infections serve to demonstrate further the nature of the crossroads that the discipline of public health entomology faces at the start of the 21st Century.

TI Food-plant niche selection rather than the presence of ant nests
   explains oviposition patterns in the myrmecophilous butterfly genus
   Maculinea
AB It has been suggested that the socially parasitic butterfly Maculinea alcon detects ant odours before ovipositing on initial larval food plants near colonies of its obligate ant host Myrmica ruginodis. It has also been suggested that overcrowding on food plants near it M. ruginodis is avoided by an ability to detect high egg loads, resulting in a switch to selecting plants near less suitable ant species. If confirmed, this hypothesis (H-1) would have serious implications for the application of current population models aimed at the conservation of endangered Maculinea species, which are based on the null hypothesis (H-o) that females randomly select food plants whose flower buds are at a precise phenological stage, making oviposition independent of ants. If H-1 were wrong, practical management based upon its assumptions could lead to the extinction of protected populations. We present data for the five European species of Maculinea which show that (i) each oviposits on a phenologically restricted flower-bud stage, which accounts for the apparent host-ant-mediated niche separation in sympatric populations of Maculinea nausithous and Maculinea teleius, (ii) there is no temporal shift in oviposition by Maculinea arion in relation to host ant distribution or egg density, and (iii) oviposition patterns in 13 populations of M. alcon's closest relative, Maculinea rebeli, conform to H-0 not H-1 predictions. It is concluded that conservation measures should continue to be based on H-0.

TI Induced maternal response to the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia
   burgdorferi sensu lato in a colonial seabird, the kittiwake Rissa
   tridactyla
AB Mothers are predicted to invest in their offspring depending on the quality of their mate, their opportunity to invest in future reproduction and the characteristics of the habitat in which their offspring will be born. Recent studies have suggested a transfer of maternal immunity to offspring as an induced response to the local presence of parasites in the environment, but evidence has been indirect. Here, we show the presence of antibodies against the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato; a spirochaete transmitted by the seabird tick Ixodes uriae, in the eggs of kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla. We report higher prevalence of antibodies against Borrelia in eggs from breeding areas with higher prevalence and abundance of ticks. Further, high repeatabilities of antibody-positive eggs within clutches and between first and replacement clutches show that, within a breeding season, females differ consistently with respect to the expression of this induced maternal response. Our results suggest that mothers can alter investment in their young depending on local conditions. Such maternal effects clearly have implications for the ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions.

TI Do fungal endophytes result in selection for leafminer ovipositional
   preference?
AB Microorganisms can alter the direction and magnitude of plant-herbivore interactions. However, how they affect the susceptibility of the host plant and their impact on the herbivore may vary depending on the scale of the interaction such as among locations, individual plants, and parts of the plant. Positive preference-performance relationships for insects in general, and for sedentary insects such as leafminers in particular, would predict that there would be negative selection pressure against females ovipositing in low-performance sites. Thus, where the presence of microorganisms causes reduced performance, selection would favor oviposition in sites where the microbes are absent. However, this assumes that ovipositing females can detect the microbes and respond by avoidance, or that females can use cues that predict the future presence of microbes and use these predictors to respond by avoidance.
   We used the Cameraria sp. leafminer-Quercus emoryi system and the associated fungal endophyte species that share the leaves of the host to test the hypothesis that leafminer ovipositional preference and therefore distribution are negatively associated with endophyte distribution at scales where endophytes mediate insect antagonism and where endophyte distribution is predictable. We censused fungal endophyte distribution and abundance on >20 trees over three growing seasons at the following scales: among trees, among positions within trees, among leaves, and between and within seasons. In addition, we censused leafminer distribution and abundance and used data on leafminer distributions at different spatial scales collected over the past decade from other studies in this system to determine how they are associated with endophytes. We found that leafminers and fungal endophytes were negatively associated at two spatial scales where endophytes have been shown to affect leafminer performance negatively and where endophyte distribution and abundance were predictable. Endophytes and leafminers were not associated at one spatial scale where endophytes do not affect leafminers, and distribution and abundance was not predictable. Leafminer growth and endophyte infection were positively associated over time as both increase over the season. The results demonstrate that leafminer ovipositional preference may have been selected by avoidance of fungal endophytes and associated endophyte mediated antagonism, but that avoidance is reliant on predictable patterns of infection.

TI Herbivore physiological state affects foraging trade-off decisions
   between nutrient intake and parasite avoidance
AB The trade-offs between nutrient and parasite intake for herbivores foraging in nutrient-poor systems are poorly understood. We tested whether a trade-off exists between the benefit of increased nutrient intake rate through grazing relatively tall swards and risks of parasitism in a grazing situation for sheep. The effect of level of feeding motivation and parasitic status on the grazing behavior of sheep faced with this trade-off was also investigated. Animals were presented with pairs of experimental swards (36 X 21 cm) that varied in height (12 cm = H+; 6 cm = H-) and level of contamination with feces from sheep infected with Ostertagia circumcincta (20 g feces per sward = FS; no feces = F-) and were allowed to graze for short periods. Experiment 1 presented four choices (H+F+ vs. H-F-; H+F+ vs. H-FS; H+F- vs. H-F-; H+F- vs. H-F+) repeated three times to 24 5-mo-old sheep divided into four animal treatment groups resulting from two levels of feeding motivation (high and moderate) and two parasitic states (parasitized and nonparasitized). Experiment 2 presented the above four choices three times each to 24 12-mo-old sheep in four animal treatment groups created from two parasitic states (parasitized and nonparasitized) and two immune states (immune and naive to O. circumcincta). All animals selected 12-cm swards over 6-cm swards in both experiments. In all choices except the trade-off choice, in both experiments, one award held a clear height or feces benefit (absence of feces) that was selected for by all treatments. When presented with the trade-off choice (H+F+ vs. H-F-), animals with a high feeding motivation selected the H+F+ sward more than moderately motivated animals did in Experiment 1. Immune animals selected the H+F+ sward more than naive animals did in Experiment 2. Subclinical parasitism in moderately feeding-motivated animals resulted in increased avoidance of feces and reduced grazing depths, thereby reducing further risk of parasitism in Experiment 1. This effect of parasitism was not repeated in the older animals of Experiment 2, where all animals maintained a high-parasite-risk grazing strategy by selecting the H+F+ award of the trade-off choice. However, parasitized animals in Experiment 2 reduced parasite intake and, therefore, the risks associated with grazing the H-I-FS sward by significantly reducing their grazing depth compared to all other treatment groups. Sheep grazing decisions involving forage intake and feces avoidance were affected by their feeding motivation, immune state, and parasitic state. Strong avoidance of feces-contaminated pasture can be overcome by the attraction of herbivores to tall swards. Trade-off frameworks are able to predict diet selection and grazing behavior, are useful when investigating host-parasite interactions, and may enhance the predictive powers of optimal foraging models.

AB Little is known about the epidemiology of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV- 8) infections among women. A cross- sectional study was conducted of HHV- 8 infection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- infected and high- risk HIV- uninfected women. Serological tests with noninduced (latent) and induced (lytic) HHV- 8 antigens were used to detect infection among 2483 participants of a multisite cohort. Reactivity to latent antigen was present in 4.1% and to induced antigens in 12.0% of women. Seven of 8 women who reported Kaposi's sarcoma had HHV- 8 antibodies. Among HIV- positive women, HHV- 8 infection was associated with use of crack, cocaine, or heroin (76% vs. 65%; P < .001), past syphilis (29% vs. 20%; P < .001), an injection drug-using male sex partner (61% vs. 53%; P = .014), black race (P = .010), and enrollment site (P = .015). In multivariate analysis, HIV infection, older age, past syphilis, black race, and enrollment site were independently associated with HHV- 8 infection. In this cohort of North American women, HHV- 8 infection was associated with HIV infection, drug use, and risky sexual behavior.

TI Variants of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
   expressed by different placental parasites are closely related and
   adhere to chondroitin sulfate a
AB Plasmodium falciparum- infected erythrocytes adhere to syncytiotrophoblast cells lining the placenta via glycosaminoglycans, such as chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) and hyaluronic acid. Adherence of infected erythrocytes to host receptors is mediated by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein- 1 (PfEMP- 1). A single PfEMP- 1 domain (duffy binding- like [DBL]- 3, of the gamma sequence class) from laboratory- adapted strains is thought to be responsible for binding to CSA. In this study, DBL-gamma domains expressed by placental P. falciparum isolates were shown to have an affinity to CSA. All parasite populations accumulating in infected placentas express only 1 variant of PfEMP-1, each of which contains a DBL-gamma domain with CSA binding capacities. Furthermore, sequence analysis data provide evidence for antigenic conservation among the DBL-gamma sequences expressed by different placental parasites. This study offers a close reflection of the process of parasite adhesion in the placenta and is crucial to the understanding of the pathogenesis of malaria during pregnancy.

   Mediterranean introduction
AB The accidental introduction of Caulerpa taxifolia into the Mediterranean is no longer under dispute. What has eluded researchers until now is definitive evidence for the original, biogeographical source population. Here we present two independent lines of evidence that support an Australian origin for the Mediterranean populations of C. taxifolia. First, we reanalysed algal rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (rDNA-ITS) sequences, combining previously published sequences from different studies with 22 new sequences. The ITS sequence comparison showed that the Australian sample is the sister group of the Mediterranean-aquarium clade. Second, cloned bacterial 16S rDNA gene sequences were analysed from the associated microflora of C. taxifolia collected from Australia, Tahiti, the Philippines and the Mediterranean. Five bacterial lineages were identified, of which three were dominant. alpha Proteobacteria were the most abundant and were found in all samples. In contrast, members of the beta Proteobacterial line and Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides line (CFB) were mainly associated with Mediterranean and Australian samples. Frequency distributions of the five bacterial lineages were significantly different among biogeographical locations. Phylogenetic analyses of the 54 bacterial sequences derived from the four C. taxifolia individuals resulted in a well-resolved tree with high bootstrap support. The topologies of the beta Proteobacteria and CFB mirror the geographical sources of their algal hosts. Bacterial-algal associations provide an identification tool that may have wide application for the detection of marine invasions.

TI Evolution of pathogen virulence: the role of variation in host phenotype
AB Selection on pathogens tends to favour the evolution of growth and reproductive rates and a concomitant level of virulence (damage done to the host) that maximizes pathogen fitness. Yet, because hosts often pose varying selective environments to pathogens, one level of virulence may not be appropriate for all host types. Indeed, if a level of virulence confers high fitness to the pathogen in one host phenotype but low fitness in another host phenotype, alternative virulence strategies may be maintained in the pathogen population. Such strategies can occur either as polymorphism, where different strains of pathogen evolve specialized virulence strategies in different host phenotypes or as polyphenism, where pathogens facultatively express alternative virulence strategies depending on host phenotype. Polymorphism potentially leads to specialist pathogens capable of infecting a limited range of host phenotypes, whereas polyphenism potentially leads to generalist pathogens capable of infecting a wider range of hosts. Evaluating how variation among hosts affects virulence evolution can provide insight into pathogen diversity and is critical in determining how host-pathogen interactions affect the phenotypic evolution of both hosts and pathogens.

   military: A seroepidemiologic survey of 21,000 troops
AB Because of a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (10-20%) among veterans seeking care in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, current US military forces were evaluated for HCV infection. Banked serum samples were randomly selected from military personnel serving in 1997 and were tested for antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). Overall prevalence of anti-HCV among 10,000 active-duty personnel was 0.48% (5/1,000 troops); prevalence increased with age from 0.1% among military recruits and active-duty personnel aged <30 years to 3.0% among troops aged <greater than or equal to>40 years. Prevalence among 2,000 Reservists and active-duty troops was similar. Based on sequential serum samples from 7,368 active-duty personnel (34,020 person-years of observation), annual incidence of infection was 2/10,000. Of 81 HCV RNA-positive troops for whom genotype was determined, genotypes 1a (63%) and 1b (22%) predominated, as in the civilian population. These data indicate that HCV infection risk among current military forces is lower than in VA studies and the general civilian population aged <40 years. The low level of HCV infection may be attributed to infrequent injection drug use in the military due to mandatory testing for illicit drugs prior to induction and throughout military service.

TI Antibodies to glycans dominate the host response to schistosome larvae
   and eggs: Is their role protective or subversive?
AB Multiple exposures of chimpanzees to the radiation-attenuated schistosome vaccine provoked a strong parasite-specific cellular and humoral immune response. Specific IgM and IgG were directed mainly against glycans on antigens released by cercariae; these were also cross-reactive with soluble antigens from larvae, adult worms, and eggs. Egg deposition was the major antigenic stimulus after challenge of vaccinated and control chimpanzees with normal parasites, eliciting strong antiglycan responses to egg secretions. Glycan epitopes recognized included LacdiNAc, fucosylated LacdiNAc, Lewis(X) (weakly), and those on keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies to peptide epitopes became prominent only during the chronic phase of infection, as glycan-specific IgM and IgG decreased. Because of their intensity and cross-reactivity, the antiglycan responses resulting from infection could be a smoke screen to subvert the immune system away from more vulnerable larval peptide epitopes. Their occurrence in humans might explain the long time required for antischistosome immunity to build up after infection.

To assess the status of arbovirus transmission in Bornean forests and the susceptibility of wild orangutans to arboviral infection, blood samples of wild orangutans. semi-captive orangutans, and humans were examined. Samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test for antibodies to viruses representing three families (Flaviviridae, Alphaviridae, and Bunyaviridae), including dengue-2, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Langat, Tembusu, Sindbis, Chikungunya, and Batai viruses. Both wild and semi-captive orangutan groups as well as local human populations showed serologic evidence of arbovirus infection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild orangutans strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and sindbis viruses in North Borneo. The present study demonstrates that orangutans are susceptible to arboviral infections in the wild, although the impact of arboviral infections on this endangered ape remain unknown.

TI Seasonal variation in host susceptibility and cycles of certain
   infectious diseases
AB Seasonal cycles of infectious diseases have been variously attributed to changes in atmospheric conditions, the prevalence or virulence of the pathogen, or the behavior of the host. Some observations about seasonality are difficult to reconcile with these explanations. These include the simultaneous appearance of outbreaks across widespread geographic regions of the same latitude; the detection of pathogens in the off-season without epidemic spread; and the consistency of seasonal changes, despite wide variations in weather and human behavior. In contrast, an increase in susceptibility of the host population, perhaps linked to the annual light/dark cycle and mediated by the pattern of melatonin secretion, might account for many heretofore unexplained features of infectious disease seasonality. Ample evidence indicates that photoperiod-driven physiologic changes are typical in mammalian species, including some in humans. If such physiologic changes underlie human resistance to infectious diseases for large portions of the year and the changes can be identified and modified, the therapeutic and preventive implications may be considerable.

Neutralizing antibodies to Nipah virus were demonstrated in five species, suggesting widespread infection in bat populations in peninsular Malaysia.

TI Biological control of Fusarium moniliforme in maize
AB Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon. a biological species of the mating populations within the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex, i.e., population A [= G. moniliformis (Sheld.) Wineland], is an example of a facultative fungal endophyte. During the biotrophic endophytic association with maize, as well as during saprophytic growth, F. moniliforme produces the fumonisins. The fungus is transmitted vertically and horizontally to the next generation of plants via clonal infection of seeds and plant debris. Horizontal infection is the manner by which this fungus is spread contagiously and through which infection occurs from the outside that can be reduced by application of certain fungicides. The endophytic phase is vertically transmitted. This type infection is important because it is not controlled by seed applications of fungicides, and it remains the reservoir from which infection and toxin biosynthesis takes place in each generation of plants. Thus, vertical transmission of this fungus is just as important as horizontal transmission. A biological control system using an endophytic bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, has been developed that shows great promise for reducing mycotoxin accumulation during the endophytic (vertical transmission) growth phase. Because this bacterium occupies the identical ecological niche within the plant, it is considered an ecological homologue to F. moniliforme, and the inhibitory mechanism, regardless of the mode of action, operates on the competitive exclusion principle. In addition to this bacterium, an isolate of a species of the fungus Trichoderma shows promise in the postharvest control of the growth and toxin accumulation from F. moniliforme on corn in storage.

TI Prospects for reducing fumonisin contamination of maize through genetic
   modification
AB Fumonisins (FB) are mycotoxins found in Fusarium verticillioides-infected maize grain worldwide. Attention has focused on FBs because of their widespread occurrence, acute toxicity to certain livestock. and their potential carcinogenicity. FBs are present at low levels in most field-grown maize but may spike to high levels depending on both the environment and genetics of the host plant. Among the strategies for reducing risk of FB contamination in maize supplied to the market, development and deployment of Fusarium ear mold-resistant maize germplasm is a high priority. Breeding for increased ear mold tolerance and reduced mycotoxin levels is being practiced today in both commercial and public programs, but the amount of resistance achievable may be limited due to complicated genetics and/or linkage to undesirable agronomic traits. Molecular markers can be employed to speed up the incorporation of chromosomal regions that have a quantitative effect on resistance (quantitative trait loci). Transgenic approaches to ear mold/mycotoxin resistance are now feasible as well. These potentially include genetically enhanced resistance to insect feeding, increased fungal resistance, and detoxification/prevention of mycotoxins in the grain. An example of the first of these approaches is already on the market, namely transgenic maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin, targeted to the European corn borer. Some Bt maize hybrids have the potential to reduce FB levels in field-harvested grain, presumably through reduced feeding of Bt-susceptible insects in ear tissues. However, improved ear mold resistance per se is still an important goal, as the plant will still be vulnerable to noninsect routes of entry to Fusarium. A second approach, transgene-mediated control of the ability of Fusarium to infect and colonize the ear, could potentially be achieved through overexpression of specific antifungal proteins and metabolites, or enhancement of the plant's own defense systems in kernel tissues. This has not yet been accomplished in maize, although promising results have been obtained recently in other monocots versus other fungal and bacterial pathogens. Achieving reproducible and stable enhanced ear mold resistance under field conditions will be immensely challenging for biotechnologists. A third approach, transgene strategies aimed at preventing mycotoxin biosynthesis, or detoxifying mycotoxins in plants, could provide further protection for the grower in environments where FBs present a risk to the crop even when the maize is relatively resistant to Fusarium mold. In one example of such a strategy, enzymes that degrade FBs have been identified in a filamentous saprophytic fungus isolated from maize, and corresponding genes have been cloned and are currently being tested in transgenic maize.

TI Parasites and the evolution of self-fertilization
AB Assuming all else is equal, an allele for selling should spread when rare in an outcrossing population and rapidly reach fixation. Such an allele will not spread, however, if self-fertilization results in inbreeding depression so severe that the fitness of selfed offspring is less that half that of outcrossed offspring. Here we consider an ecological force that may also counter the spread of a selfing allele: coevolution with parasites. Computer simulations were conducted for four different genetic models governing the details of infection. Within each of these models, we varied both the level of selfing in the parasite and the level of male-gamete discounting in the host (i.e., the reduction in outcrossing fitness through male function due to the selfing allele). We then sought the equilibrium level of host selfing under the different conditions. The results show that, over;l wide range of conditions, parasites can select for host reproductive strategies in which both selfed and outcrossed progeny are produced (mixed mating). In addition, mixed mating, where it exits, tends to be biased toward selfing.

TI Sexual selection in an isopod with Wolbachia-induced sex reversal: males
   prefer real females
AB A variety of genetic elements encode traits beneficial to their own transmission. Despite their 'selfish' behaviour, most of these elements are often found at relatively low frequencies in host populations. This is the case of intracytoplasmic Wolbachia bacteria hosted by the isopod Armadillidium vulgare that distort the host sex ratio towards females by feminizing the genetic males they infect. Here we tested the hypothesis that sexual selection against Wolbachia-infected females could maintain a polymorphism of the infection in populations. The infected neo-females (feminized males) have lower mating rates and received less sperm relative to uninfected females. Males exhibited an active choice: they interacted more with uninfected females and made more mating attempts. A female behavioural difference was also observed in response to male mating attempts: infected neo-females more often exhibited behaviours that stop the mating sequence. The difference in mating rate was significant only when males could choose between the two female types. This process could maintain a polymorphism of the infection in populations. Genetic females experimentally infected with Wolbachia are not exposed to the same sexual selection pressure, so the infection alone cannot explain these differences.

TI Host specificity of a generalist parasite: genetic evidence of sympatric
   host races in the seabird tick Ixodes uriae
AB Due to the close association between parasites and their hosts, many 'generalist' parasites have a high potential to become specialized on different host species. We investigated this hypothesis for a common ectoparasite of seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae that is often found in mixed host sites. We examined patterns of neutral genetic variation between ticks collected from Black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) and Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) in sympatry. To control for a potential distance effect, values were compared to differences among ticks from the same host in nearby monospecific sites. As predicted, there was higher genetic differentiation between ticks from different sympatric host species than between ticks from nearby allopatric populations of the same host species. Patterns suggesting isolation by distance were found among tick populations of each host group, but no such patterns existed between tick populations of different hosts. Overall, results suggest that host-related selection pressures have led to the specialization of I. uriae and that host race formation may be an important diversifying mechanism in parasites.

TI Lack of molluscan host diversity and the transmission of an emerging
   parasitic disease in Bolivia
AB Fasciolosis is a re-emerging parasitic disease that affects an increasing number of people in developing countries. The most severe endemic affects the Bolivian Altiplano, where the liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) and its hermaphroditic snail host, Lymnaea truncatula, have been introduced from Europe. To achieve a better understanding of the epidemiological situation and the consequences of the colonization event of this invasive species, genetic analysis of Bolivian snail populations was needed. Here we compare the genetic diversity and population structure of snail samples from the Bolivian Altiplano with samples from the Old World at six polymorphic microsatellite loci. Whereas some variability exists in the snail populations from the Old World, we observe only a single genotype of L. truncatula in the Bolivian Altiplano. We discuss the possible explanations for such a reduction in genetic variability, and, given the high natural parasitism pressures exerted on the snail populations, we discuss the relevance of this result for host-parasite interactions.

TI Differences in the temporal trends of HIV seroincidence and

   1989-1998: Application of the serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV
   seroconversion
AB The authors compared temporal trends in the prevalence and incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection based upon 34,866 specimens from patients who attended the San Francisco, California, municipal sexually transmitted disease clinic between 1989 and 1998. HIV infection data were collected during annual blinded HIV serologic surveys. Incidence was determined by applying a serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion that uses both a sensitive and a less sensitive enzyme immunoassay to stored HIV positive sera. The HIV seroprevalence declined from 15.2% in 1989 to 7.2% in 1998 (odds ratio per year = 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 0.94). Among homosexual men, the HIV prevalence declined from 50.9% in 1989 to 19.9% in 1998 (odds ratio per year = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.88). The pooled seroincidence was 1.6% and did not change significantly over time (odds ratio per year = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.1). The pooled seroincidence among homosexual men was 6.6% per year and remained steady between 1989 and 1998 (odds ratio per year = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.1). During a dramatic, 10-year decline in seroprevalence of HIV infection, the incidence of HIV infection remained remarkably stable.

TI An empirical model of species coexistence in a spatially structured
   environment
AB Ecological theory has long supported the idea that species coexistence in a homogeneous habitat is promoted by spatial structure, but empirical evidence for this hypothesis has lagged behind theory. Here we describe a Neotropical ant-plant symbiosis that is ideally suited for testing spatial models of coexistence. Two genera of ants, Allomerus cf. demerarae and three species of Azteca are specialized to live on a single species of ant-plant, Cordia nodosa, in a Western Amazonian tropical rain forest. Empirically, using census data from widely separated localities, we show that the relative colonization abilities of the two ant genera are a function of plant density. A parameterized model shows that this pattern alone is sufficiently robust to explain coexistence in;the system. Census and experimental data suggest that Azteca queens are better long-distance flyers, but that Allomerus colonies are more fecund. Thus, Azteca can dominate in areas where host-plant densities are low land parent colony-sapling distances are long), and Allomerus can dominate in areas where host-plant densities are high. Existing spatial heterogeneity in host-plant densities therefore can allow regional coexistence, and intersite dispersal can produce local mixing. In conclusion, a dispersal-fecundity trade-off appears to allow the two genera to treat spatial heterogeneity in patch density as a niche axis. This study further suggests that a spatially structured approach is essential in understanding the persistence of some mutualisms in the presence of parasites.

TI Helicobacter pylori prevalences and risk factors among school beginners
   in a German urban center and its rural county
AB In 1998, the Helicobacter pylori [C-13]urea breath test was offered to all school beginners (birth cohort 1991/1992) in the city of Leipzig and in Leipzig County, Germany, to determine the colonization prevalence and potential transmission pathways of the bacterium. A total of 3,347 school beginners participated in the test, and 2,888 parents completed the detailed, self-administered questionnaire. The H. pylori prevalence was 6.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.3-7.6] in the city and 5.7% (CI, 4.2-7.0) in the county. Using cluster analysis (WARD's method, Euclidean distances), we identified different sets of variables (confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analyses [odds ratios (ORs)] that are significantly associated with H. pylori positivity. Among city children, the risk is significantly increased with contact to a pet hamster (OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.7; p < 0.015) and travels to Asian countries (OR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6-8.7; p < 0.002). Among county children, N. pylori positivity increased significantly with drinking of water from nonmunicipal sources (OR = 16.4; 95% CI, 3.1-88.5; p < 0.001), more than 3 children living in a household (OR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.2-14.6; p < 0.02), and contact with pet hamsters (OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7; p < 0.04). These data suggest that, in a general population sample, indirect fecal-oral transmission and living conditions are important risk factors in the spread of H. pylori infection. However, clinical symptoms do not necessarily indicate H. pylori positivity.

TI Comparative utility of restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
   and gene sequencing to the molecular epidemiological investigation of a
   viral outbreak
AB Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and partial-genome DNA sequencing are commonly used to infer genetic relationships among pathogens. This study compares the application of both techniques to the analysis of 16 pseudorabies virus isolates collected during a 1989 outbreak. Genetic distances derived from RFLP and DNA sequence data were not significantly correlated with geographic distances between farms from which isolates were collected. RFLP-based genetic distance was, however, strongly correlated with temporal distance between isolates (days separating time of isolation). Sequence-based genetic distance was significantly correlated with temporal distance only when synonymous changes (nucleotide changes not leading to amino acid changes) were considered separately. Conversely, non-synonymous changes were correlated with the host species of origin of the viral isolate. These results indicate that selectively-neutral genetic changes most accurately reflect historical relationships, but that non-neutral changes most accurately reflect the biological environment of the viral isolate (e.g. host immune system).

TI Genetic variation in a host-parasite association: Potential for
   coevolution and frequency-dependent selection
AB Models of host-parasite coevolution assume the presence of genetic variation for host resistance and parasite infectivity, as well as genotype-specific interactions. We used the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna and its bacterial microparasite Pasteuria ramosa to study genetic variation for host susceptibility and parasite infectivity within each of two populations. We sought to answer the following questions: Do host clones differ in their susceptibility to parasite isolates? Do parasite isolates differ in their ability to infect different host crones? Are there host clone-parasite isolate interactions? The analysis revealed considerable variation in both hose resistance and parasite infectivity. There were significant host clone-parasite isolate interactions, such that there was no single host clone that was superior to all other clones in the resistance to every parasite isolate. Likewise, there was no parasite isolate that was superior to all other isolates in infectivity to every host clone. This form of host clone-parasite isolate interaction indicates the potential for coevolution based on frequency-dependent selection. Infection success of original host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were isolated together) was significantly higher than infection success of novel host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were created in the laboratory). This finding is consistent with the idea that parasites track specific host genotypes under natural conditions. In addition, correspondence analysis revealed that some host clones, although distinguishable with neutral genetic markers, were susceptible to the same set of parasite isolates and thus probably shared resistance genes.

TI Temporal patterns of genetic variation for resistance and infectivity in
   a Daphnia-microparasite system
AB Theoretical studies have indicated that the population genetics of host-parasite interactions may be highly dynamic, with parasites perpetually adapting to common host genotypes and hosts evolving resistance to common parasite genotypes. The present study examined temporal Variation in resistance of hosts and infectivity of parasites within three populations of Daphnia magna infected with the sterilizing bacterium Pasteuria ramosa. Parasite isolates and host clones were collected in each of two years (1997, 1998) from one population; in two other populations. hosts were collected from both pears, but parasites from only the first year. We then performed infection experiments (separately for each population) that exposed hosts to parasites from the same year or made combinations involving hosts and parasites from different years. In two populations, patterns were consistent with the evolution of host resistance: either infectivity or the speed with which parasites sterilized hosts declined from 1997 to 1998. In another population, infectivity, virulence, and parasite spore production did not vary among host-year or parasite-year. For this population, we also detected strong within-population genetic variation for resistance. Thus, in this case, generic variability for fitness-related traits apparently did not translate into evolutionary change. We discuss a number of reasons why,genetic change may not occur as expected in parasite-host systems, including negative correlations between resistance and other traits, gene flow, or that the dynamic process itself may obscure the detection of gene frequency changes.

TI Urban Zoonoses Caused by Bartonella, Coxiella, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia
   Species
AB The last half of the 20th Century witnessed an increase in the occurrence and recognition of urban zoonoses caused by members of the genera Bartonella, Coxiella, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia, all traditionally considered to be members of the family Rickettsiaceae. In recent years, new human pathogens (Bartonella elizabethae, Bartonella henselae, and Rickettsia felis) have been recognized in urban environments. Other newly recognized pathogens (Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia phagocytophila in the United States) have sylvan zoonotic cycles but are present in urban areas because their vertebrate hosts and associated ectoparasitic arthropod vectors are able to survive in cities. Still other agents, which were primarily of historical importance (Bartonella quintana) or have not traditionally been associated with urban environments (Rickettsia rickettsii), have been recognized as causes of human disease in urban areas. Some diseases that have traditionally been associated with urban environments, such as rickettsialpox (caused by Rickettsia akari) and murine typhus (caused by Rickettsia typhi), still occur in large cities at low or undetermined frequencies and often go undetected, despite the availability of effective measures to diagnose and control them. In addition, alternate transmission cycles have been discovered for Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia prowazekii, and R. typhi that differ substantially from their established, classic cycles, indicating that the epidemiology of these agents is more complex than originally thought and may be changing.
   Factors leading to an increase in the incidence of illnesses caused by these bacteria in urban areas include societal changes as well as intrinsic components of the natural history of these organisms that favor their survival in cities. Transovarial and transstadial transmission of many of the agents in their arthropod hosts contributes to the highly focal nature of many of the diseases they cause by allowing the pathogens to persist in areas during adverse times when vertebrate amplifying hosts may be scarce or absent. Domesticated animals (primarily cats, dogs, and livestock) or commensal rodents [ primarily Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice (Mus musculus)] can serve as vertebrate amplifying hosts and bring these agents and their ectoparasitic arthropod vectors into direct association with humans and help maintain transmission cycles in densely populated urban areas.
   The reasons for the increase in these urban zoonoses are complex. Increasing population density worldwide, shifts in populations from rural areas to cities, increased domestic and international mobility, an increase in homelessness, the decline of inner-city neighborhoods, and an increase in the population of immunosuppressed individuals all contribute to the emergence and recognition of human diseases caused by these groups of agents. Due to the focal nature of infections in urban areas, control or prevention of these diseases is possible. Increased physician awareness and public health surveillance support will be required to detect and treat existing urban infections caused by these agents, to determine the disease burden caused by them, to design and implement control programs to combat and prevent their spread, and to recognize emerging or resurging infections caused by members of these genera as they occur.

TI Acquisition Dynamics of Borrelia burgdorferi and the Agent of Human
   Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis at the Host-Vector Interface
AB The population dynamics of two cotransmitted tick-borne pathogens, Borrelia burgdorferi and the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (aoHGE), were assessed at the skin-vector interface at intervals after tick attachment on infected mice. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting the B. burgdorferi flagellin gene revealed consistent decreases in spirochete numbers in skin at the sites of tick attachment compared with non-tick attachment sites. This phenomenon was found during early (2 weeks) and late (8 weeks) infection and at 24, 48, and 72 h after tick attachment. A nonspecific inflammatory stimulus, implantation of suture material, did not have this effect. In contrast to B. burgdorferi, copy numbers of an aoHGE p44 target gene target were significantly increased at the sites of tick attachment, compared with non-tick sites. The non-specific stimulus of suture material had the same effect on aoHGE recruitment as tick attachment in aoHGE infected mice. These results reinforce the concept that B. burgdorferi interfaces with its vector by virtue of its non-systemic dermatotropism, and not via systemic hematogenous acquisition. In contrast, results indicate that the aoHGE relies upon hematogenous acquisition. Thus, these two cotransmitted tick-borne pathogens utilize distinctly different means of vector acquisition.

AB Sin Nombre virus (SNV), hosted by the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), is the primary etiologic agent of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North America. To improve our understanding of the epidemiology of HPS in the western United States, we conducted studies of population dynamics and SNV antibody prevalence in deer mouse populations for 6 years on 12 mark-recapture grids in Montana. Monthly numbers of deer mice ranged from zero to over 170 on I-hectare grids. SNV antibody prevalence was higher than observed in studies in other parts of the United States, averaging 13% (0% to 50%), and peaking in May or June each year. Antibody-positive mice were older (heavier) (78% of positives were adults versus 52% of negatives) and more likely to be males (61% of positives versus 53.4% of negatives). A higher proportion of antibody-positive deer mice of all age-mass classes had scars than did antibody-negative mice. Month-to-month survivorship of antibody-positive adult mice was similar to that of antibody-negative mice, but survival of young antibody-positive deer mice was lower than antibody-negative deer mice. This is the first study to clearly suggest a detrimental effect of SNV infection on deer mice.

   virus infection in Norway rats
AB In the field, male rodents are more frequently infected with hantaviruses than females. This study examined whether patterns of immune responses against hantavirus differed between the sexes. Male and female Long Evans rats (Rattus norvegicus) were inoculated with Seoul virus, and antibody and cytokine responses, as well as virus shedding were assessed. Males were more likely to shed virus in saliva, to shed virus through multiple routes (saliva, urine, and feces), and to have viral RNA in the spleen than females. Anti-Seoul virus IgG responses were higher in males than females. In both sexes, splenic IFN gamma and IL-4 production increased following infection. After infection, males had higher Th I immune responses (i.e., IgG2a, IFN gamma, and IL-2) than females: in contrast, Th2 immune responses (i.e., IgG I, IL-4. and IL-10) were similar between the sexes. These data suggest that immune responses to Seoul virus differ between the sexes.

TI Effects of disease and pond drying on gray tree frog growth,
   development, and survival
AB Pathogens have important effects on host growth. behavior, and population dynamics. Nevertheless, the impact of parasitic infection on host populations may be strongly context dependent. For example, the outcome of host-pathogen interactions may be subject to change based on the level of abiotic stress experienced by the host. In northeastern Connecticut. USA, larvae of the gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) co-occur in temporary and permanent ponds with a snail (Pseudosuccinea columella) that is frequently infected with a digenetic trematode (Telorchis sp.) whose free-swimming cercariae subsequently infect H. versicolor tadpoles. Field collections of H. versicolor tadpoles suggest that the prevalence of infection by trematodes can be as high as 71%. We measured survival, mass, and time to metamorphosis of larval gray treefrogs in an artificial pond experiment designed to determine how infection with trematode cercariae and the stress of pond drying interact to influence gray treefrog performance. We exposed gray treefrog tadpoles to infected snails, uninfected snails. or no snails, within artificial ponds that were either permanent or subjected to a 49-d drying regime. The presence of infected P. columella had strong negative effects on the performance of gray treefrog larvae. However. this effect depended on whether ponds were temporary or permanent. When tadpoles were exposed to infected snails in temporary ponds. survivorship to metamorphosis decreased by similar to 30%. and mass at metamorphosis was reduced by 40%. The presence of infected P. columella had no detectable effect on larval performance of gray treefrogs in permanent ponds. Assays of infection level (mean number of cysts per individual) indicate that temporary pond animals were exposed to higher rates of infection. In contrast. uninfected snails had very little effect on H. versicolor in either temporary or permanent pools. There was. however, a small increase in time to metamorphosis for H. versicolor in permanent pools that were exposed to increased densities of uninfected snails. Our results indicate that an endemic parasite can have large effects on the performance of its native host, but that these effects may be strongly context dependent. Given this strong context dependence, an important challenge is to assay these effects within the natural environment.

TI Host-parasite-herbivore interactions: Implications of host cyanogenesis
AB To examine the mediation of host-predator interaction by a parasite, we studied the three-level interactions among a host plant, a root hemiparasitic plants and their common predator., a generalist snail herbivore. The host species, Tr folium repens, is able to synthesize cyanogenic glucosides that have a significant role in plant herbivore resistance. Some T. repens populations are polymorphic with respect to cyanogenesis. Our second aim was to examine whether the mediation of the host plant-herbivore interaction by the parasitic plant could affect the maintenance of the cyanogenic polymorphism.
   The parasitic plant (Rhinanthus serotinits) was equally harmful to cyanogenic and acyanogenic hosts and grew equally well on both host types. In a no-choice experiment, both cyanogenesis and root hemiparasitism of the host plant reduced the growth of the herbivore (Arianta arbustorum). The herbivores consumed less leaf area of the parasitized plants than of unparasitized plants. but only when the host plant was acyanogenic. In a multiple-choice experiment, the snails were similarly affected by cyanogenesis but not by parasitic infection of the host. Thus, there was a discrepancy between food choice and performance of the herbivore. Our results suggest that the overall effects of the parasitic plant on the host plant were ameliorated through the indirect effects of the parasitic infection on herbivore performance and food consumption. This indirect effect of the parasitic infection seemed to be more beneficial for the acyanogenic plants: if parasitized, the leaf area of acyanogenic plants consumed by the herbivore was 45% higher than that of cyanogenic plants, whereas in unparasitized plants the corresponding figure was 114%. Thus, parasitism may decrease the advantage cyanogenic plants gain through decreased herbivory. Further, in mainly cyanogenic T. repens populations, cyanogenesis might be a more important feeding deterrent than root parasitism: whereas in mainly acyanogenic populations root parasitism might be relevant to herbivore-T. repens interactions. We are the first to document the effects of a plant parasite on the performance of both the host plant and a host-feeding herbivore. Our results highlight the need to look beyond the direct effect of parasites on their hosts.

TI Marine swimming-related illness: Implications for monitoring and

AB There is increasing evidence that environmental degradation may be contributing to an increase in marine-related diseases across a wide range of taxonomic groups. This includes a growing number of reports of both recreational and occupational users of marine waters developing gastrointestinal, respiratory, dermatologic, and ear, nose, and throat infections. The duration and type of exposure, concentration of pathogens, and host immunity determine the risk of infection. Public health authorities may not be able to accurately predict the risk of waterborne disease from marine waters due to the limitations of conventional monitoring, as well as erroneous perceptions of pathogen life span in marine systems. Pathogens undetectable by conventional methods may remain viable in marine waters, and both plankton and marine sediments may serve as reservoirs for pathogenic organisms, which can emerge to become infective when conditions are favorable. In this paper we address the environmental factors that may contribute to illness, the types of associated economic costs, the issues of water quality monitoring and the policy implications raised by the apparent rise in incidence of marine water-related illnesses.

TI Meiotic recombination, cross-reactivity, and persistence in Plasmodium
   falciparum
AB We incorporate a representation of Plasmodium falciparum recombination within a discrete-event model of malaria transmission. We simulate the introduction of a new parasite genotype into a human population in which another genotype has reached equilibrium prevalence and compare the emergence and persistence of the novel recombinant forms under differing cross-reactivity relationships between the genotypes. Cross-reactivity between the parental (initial and introduced) genotypes reduces the frequency of appearance of recombinants within three years of introduction from 100% to 14%, and delays their appearance by more than a year, on average. Cross-reactivity between parental and recombinant genotypes reduces the frequency of appearance to 36% and increases the probability of recombinant extinction following appearance from 0% to 83%. When a recombinant is cross-reactive with its parental types, its probability of extinction is influenced by cross-reactivity between the parental types in the opposite manner; that is, its probability of extinction after appearance decreases. Frequencies of P. falciparum outcrossing are mediated by frequencies of mixed-genotype infections in the host population, which are in turn mediated by the structure of cross-reactivity between parasite genotypes. The three leading hypotheses about how meiosis relates to oocyst production lead to quantitative, but no qualitative, differences in these results.

TI Multiple infection dynamics has pronounced effects on the fitness of RNA
   viruses
AB Several factors play a role during the replication and transmission of RNA viruses. First, as a consequence of their enormous mutation rate, complex mixtures of genomes are generated immediately after infection of a new host. Secondly, differences in growth and competition rates drive the selection of certain genetic variants within an infected host. Thirdly, but not less important, a random sampling occurs at the moment of viral infectious passage from an infected to a healthy host. In addition, the availability of hosts also influences the fate of a given viral genotype. When new hosts are scarce, different viral genotypes might infect the same host, adding an extra complexity to the competition among genetic variants. We have employed a two-fold approach to analyse the role played by each of these factors in the evolution of RNA viruses. First, we have derived a model that takes into account all the preceding factors. This model employs the classic Lotka-Volterra competition equations but it also incorporates the effect of mutation during RNA replication, the effect of the stochastic sampling at the moment of infectious passage among hosts and, the effect of the type of infection (single, coinfection or superinfection). Secondly, the predictions of the model have been tested in an in vitro evolution experiment. Both theoretical and experimental results show that in infection passages with coinfection viral fitness increased more than in single infections. In contrast, infection passages with superinfection did not differ from the single infection. The coinfection frequency also affected the outcome: the larger the proportion of viruses coinfecting a host, the larger increase in fitness observed.

TI Cellular replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 occurs in
   vaginal secretions
AB Most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission worldwide is the result of exposure to infectious virus in genital secretions. However, current vaccine candidates are based on virus isolates from blood. In this study, vaginal secretions from HIV-1-infected women were examined for evidence of cellular viral replication that produced virus with properties different from that in blood. Multiply spliced HIV-1 messenger RNA, which is found only in cells replicating virus, was detected in all vaginal lavage samples tested. There was a strong correlation between the amounts of multiply spliced HIV-1 messenger RNA and of cell-free HIV-1 RNA in the lavage samples. In addition, significant genotypic differences were found in cell-free virus from matched blood plasma and vaginal secretions. Moreover, drug resistance-associated mutations appeared in plasma virus several months before appearing in vaginal virus. These findings indicate that cellular replication of HIV-1 occurs in vaginal secretions and can result in a virus population with important differences from that in blood.

TI Molecular differentiation of the Old World Culicoides imicola species
   complex (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae), inferred using random amplified
   polymorphic DNA markers
AB Samples of seven of the 10 morphological species of midges of the Culicoides imicola complex were considered. The importance of this species complex is connected to its vectorial capacity for African horse sickness virus (AHSV) and bluetongue virus (BTV). Consequently, the risk of transmission may vary dramatically, depending upon the particular cryptic species present in a given area. The species complex is confined to the Old World and our samples were collected in Southern Africa, Madagascar and the Ivory Coast. Genomic DNA of 350 randomly sampled individual midges from 19 populations was amplified using four 20-mer primers by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. One hundred and ninety-six interpretable polymorphic bands were obtained. Species-specific RAPD profiles were defined and for five species diagnostic RAPD fragments were identified. A high degree of polymorphism was detected in the species complex, most of which was observed within populations (from 64 to 76%). Principal coordinate analysis (PCO) and cluster analysis provided an estimate of the degree of variation between and within populations and species. There was substantial concordance between the taxonomies derived from morphological and molecular data. The amount and the different distributions of genetic (RAFD) variation among the taxa can be associated to their life histories, i.e. the abundance and distribution of the larval breeding sites and their seasonality.

TI Effects of Schistocephalus solidus infection on brain monoaminergic
   activity in female three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus
AB The three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus is an intermediate host of the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus. Changes in predator avoidance, foraging and shoaling behaviour have been reported in sticklebacks infested with S. solidus, but the mechanisms underlying parasite-induced behavioural changes are not understood. Monoamine neurotransmitters are involved in the control of behaviour and central monoaminergic systems are sensitive to various stressors. Thus, the behavioural effects of S. solidus infestation might be a reflection of changes in brain monoaminergic activity in the stickleback host. The concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and their metabolites 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanilic acid (HVA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were measured in the telecephalons, hypothalami and brainstems of parasitized and non-parasitized female sticklebacks held in the laboratory. The ratios of 5-HIAA:5-HT were significantly elevated in both the hypothalami and brainstems of infected sticklebacks. The concentrations of 5-HT and NE were significantly reduced in the telencephalons of infected fish as compared with controls, but there was no elevation of metabolite concentrations. The results are consistent with chronic stress in infected fish, but may also reflect other alteration of neuroendocrine status resulting from parasite infection.

TI Recombination confounds interpretations of Wolbachia evolution
AB Wolbachia are vertically transmitted bacteria known from arthropods and nematode worms, which are maintained in host populations because they either physiologically benefit infected individuals or parasitically manipulate their reproduction. The different manipulation phenotypes are scattered across the Wolbachia phylogeny, suggesting that there have been multiple evolutions of similar phenotypes. This conclusion relies on the assumption of an absence of recombination between bacterial strains, so that the gene used to reconstruct the phylogeny reflects the evolutionary history of the genes involved in the trait. We tested for recombination by reconstructing the phylogeny of two Wolbachia genes from seven B-subdivision strains. The two genes produced mutually incompatible topologies, indicating that these lineages are subject to genetic recombination. This means that many evolutionary patterns inferred from Wolbachia phylogenies must be re-evaluated. Furthermore, recombination may be an important feature both in the evolution of the manipulation phenotypes and avoidance of Mullers' ratchet. Finally, we discuss the implications of recombinations for attempts to genetically engineer Wolbachia for use in the control of crop pests and human pathogens.

TI Seroepidemiology of toxoplasmosis in Amerindians from western Venezuela
AB A survey of 447 Amerindians aged 1-69 years (mean age, 18.6 +/- 15.8 years) in 3 mountain and I lowland communities from Venezuela were studied to determine the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii, the environmental risk factors for the infection, and how the process of acculturation may affect the transmission rate. Serum samples were tested for immunoglobulin G antibodies by a commercial indirect hemagglutination test. The overall prevalence of infection was 49.7% (222 of 447) and ranged 38.2-62.4%. A higher antibody rate was found in the lowland setting as compared with those from the mountain area (P < 0.001). The geometric mean titer in the overall population was 280.3. No age-antibody association was detected in the mountain communities, although a gradual increase in positivity with increasing age (P < 0.01) was observed in the lowland setting, reaching a peak of 83.3% in the oldest group. The results suggest that transmission by infective cat feces may play a predominant role in the spread of infection in this population. This study demonstrates the environmental Toxoplasma infection pressure in this sylvatic population and how transmission rate is facilitated by environmental changes produced by acculturation.

TI Population regulation in an aquatic insect: The role of disease
AB We studied the dynamics of a univoltine stream-dwelling caddistly, Brachycentrus americanus, and its microsporidian disease for 15 yr. The pathogen is highly virulent. with infections generally resulting in death during the larval stage. In most years, we sampled Brachycentrus immatures every 1-2 mo to estimate population density and disease prevalence. Brachycentrus population dynamics exhibited strong evidence for direct and delayed (1 generation lag) density dependence and appeared to cycle with a period of similar to4 yr. Pathogen prevalence in Brachycentrus was > 10% in all generations and frequently exceeded 50%. Disease prevalence also exhibited cyclic behavior. with peaks in prevalence following Brachycentrus generations with relatively high population density. There was no evidence for direct density-dependent parasitism. but there was strong evidence for density-dependent infection delayed by one generation. A path analysis model suggested that the disease mediated much of the strong density dependence observed in Brachycentrus. Collectively, these observations suggest that the pathogen is largely responsible for driving observed Brachycentrus dynamics.

TI Air pollutant-enhanced respiratory disease in experimental animals
AB Studies in animals have shown that a wide range of airborne particulates including cigarette smoke, acid aerosols, metals, organic compounds, and combustion products can interfere with the normal defense processes of the lung to enhance susceptibility to respiratory infection or exacerbate allergic diseases. Such detrimental effects are less easy to quantify in humans because of the difficulties in obtaining comprehensive exposure history and health status in large populations and because of the inherent dangers of inducing disease in clinical studies. In this article we describe examples of how air pollutants affect lung disease in experimental animal systems. This information can be used to predict the health risk of simple and complex exposures and to lend insight into the mechanisms of air pollution toxicity.

TI Vaccine-induced antibody responses as parameters of the influence of
   endogenous and environmental factors
AB In laboratory animals, an adequate way to assess effects of environmental exposures on the immune system is to study effects on antigen-specific immune responses, such as after sensitization to T-cell-dependent antigens. This probably also applies to testing effects in the human population. It has thus been suggested that antibody responses to vaccination might be useful in this context. Vaccination responses may be influenced by a variety of factors other than environmental ones. One factor is the vaccine itself; a second is the vaccination procedure used. In addition, the intrinsic capacity of the recipient to respond to a vaccine, which is determined by sex, genetic factors, and age, is important. Psychological stress, nutrition, and (infectious) diseases are also likely to have an impact. We reviewed the literature on vaccine response. With regard to exogenous factors, there is good evidence that smoking, diet, psychological stress, and certain infectious diseases affect vaccination titers, although it is difficult to determine to what extent. Genetic factors render certain individuals nonresponsive to vaccination. In general, in epidemiologic studies of adverse effects of exposure to agents in the environment in which vaccination titers are used, these additional factors need to be taken into consideration. Provided that these factors are corrected for, a study that shows an association of exposure to a given agent with diminished vaccination responses may indicate suboptimal function of the immune system and clinically relevant diminished immune response. It is quite unlikely that environmental exposures that affect responses to vaccination may in fact abrogate protection to the specific pathogen for which vaccination was performed. Only in those cases where individuals have a poor response to the vaccine may exogenous factors perhaps have a clinically significant influence on resistance to the specific pathogen. An exposure-associated inhibition of a vaccination response may, however, signify a decreased host resistance to pathogens against which no vaccination had been performed.

TI A model based evaluation of the 1996-7 pertussis epidemic in the
   Netherlands
AB In the Netherlands a strong epidemic outbreak of pertussis took place in 1996-7. Here we investigate the possible causes of the epidemic, using an age-structured epidemic model. Motivated by the observation that during the epidemic the number of cases in vaccinated children had increased considerably compared to the preceding period, we focus on two vaccination related changes. First, we consider the possibility that the potency of the vaccine decreased so that it confers protection for a shorter period of time in newly vaccinated children. Second, we consider the possibility that at a certain point in time the duration of protection after vaccination decreased for all individuals. This may be the case if the pathogen population changed such that the current vaccine confers less protection. A comparison of the observed and simulated age-distribution of infections indicates that the second scenario is more in line with the observed pattern of the 1996-7 epidemic. We discuss the implications of this conclusion for B. pertussis circulation, and for the design of vaccination programmes in the face of a polymorphic B. pertussis population that may adapt itself to vaccination.

TI Expression dynamics of human cytomegalovirus immune evasion genes US3,
   US6, and US11 in the blood of lung transplant recipients
AB Delayed elimination of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-infected cells by the host immune system may contribute to viral dissemination and pathogenesis of HCMV infection. The mRNA expression dynamics of HCMV-encoded immune evasion genes US3, US6, and US11 expressed after active HCMV infection were analyzed in blood samples of lung transplant recipients by means of quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. The results were compared with the expression dynamics of IE1 mRNA and pp67 late mRNA, levels of pp65 antigenemia, and antiviral treatment. During acute infection, high levels of US3 and US6 RNA were detected before antigenemia, which were detected simultaneously with IE1 RNA. US11 RNA was detected simultaneously with antigenemia but before late pp67 RNA. These data suggest an active role of viral immune evasion during HCMV infection in vivo. Interestingly, immune evasion RNA remained detectable after clinical recovery, often independently of IE1 RNA expression, indicating persistent viral activity, which may have implications for long-term control of HCMV.

TI Suburban transmission of Q fever in French Guiana: Evidence of a wild
   reservoir
AB The annual incidence of Q fever in French Guiana was found to have increased in 1996 and was 37/100,000 population over the last 4 years. Subsequent investigations in Cayenne and its suburbs indicated that a wild reservoir of the bacteria was responsible for the epidemiologic pattern. A case-control study showed that residence near a forest and occupations and activities that result in exposure to aerosols of dusts from the soil are risk factors for Q fever. By means of time-series analysis, a strong positive correlation between rainfall and the incidence of Q fever with a time lag of 1-3 months was found. The spatial distribution of the cases showed that transmission occurs widely throughout greater Cayenne, which is incompatible with a pinpoint source of contamination. Transmission from livestock and dissemination of the bacteria by the wind appeared to be unlikely, which strengthens the hypothesis that a wild reservoir is responsible for transmission.

TI The molecular basis of nonoxynol-9-induced vaginal inflammation and its
   possible relevance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmission
AB Topical microbicides are being sought to prevent sexually transmitted diseases by inactivating pathogens while preserving or enhancing the natural mucosal barrier. Serious public health concerns were raised by a recent phase 3 clinical trial that showed that nonoxynol-9 (N-9), a leading microbicide candidate widely used as an over-the-counter spermicide, may actually increase human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission. The present study links N-9-induced vaginal inflammation to increased risk of HIV-1 infection. Analysis of molecular and cellular components in cervicovaginal secretions, as well as results from in vitro activation of cervicovaginal epithelial cells and U1/HIV promonocytic cells, showed that multiple N-9 use can promote HIV-1 transmission through interleukin-1-mediated NF-kappaB activation, which leads to chemokine-induced recruitment of HIV-1 host cells and increased HIV-1 replication in infected cells. Furthermore, this study identifies in vitro and in vivo model systems for monitoring undesirable proinflammatory effects of microbicides and other vaginal products.

TI A parasite that increases host lifespan
AB Tenebrio molitor is an intermediate host for the rat tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta. Parasite oncospheres hatch in the. beetle midgut and burrow through into the haemocoel, where they rapidly grow and mature into metacestodes. Repair of damage incurred during invasion and the nutritional demands of the parasites are likely to impose costs on the host. Despite these costs, there is an overall very highly significant difference in survival time (p < 0.001) between infected and control populations of beetles, with a hazard ratio of 2.35 (control versus infected). Infected females showed a 40% increase in survival time to 50% mortality and males showed a 25% increase in survival time to 50% mortality. This parasite-induced increase in host longevity is discussed in the light of changes in resource allocation that may occur it] infected beetles. Previous findings have demonstrated that reproductive success is significantly reduced in infected females. The outcome of changes in the reproductive effort made by male beetles is less clear. We suggest that the optimum trade-off between reproduction and longevity may be altered to favour longer host survivorship, which is likely to enhance parasite transmission.

The notified cases of Ross River virus infection came from 489 localities between 1985 and 1988, 805 between 1989 and 1992, and 1,157 between 1993 and 1996 (X (2)((df = 2)) = 680.9; P < 0.001).

The geographic distribution of the notified Ross River virus cases has expanded in Queensland over recent years. As Ross River virus disease has impacted considerably on tourism and industry, as well as on residents of affected areas, more research is required to explore the causes of the geographic expansion of the notified Ross River virus infections.

AB Nine cases of melioidosis with four deaths occurred over a 28-month period in members of a small remote Aboriginal community in the top end of the Northern Territory of Australia. Typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed isolates of Burkholderia pseudomallei from six of the cases to be clonal and also identical to an isolate from the community water supply, but not to soil isolates. The clonality of the isolates found in this cluster contrasts with the marked genetic diversity of human and environmental isolates found in this region which is hyperendemic for B. pseudomallei. It is possible that the clonal bacteria persisted and were propagated in biofilm in the water supply system. While the exact mode of transmission to humans and the reasons for cessation of the outbreak remain uncertain, contamination of the unchlorinated community water supply is a likely explanation.

AB In 1994-1996, 185 strains of dengue (DEN) virus types 1, 2, and 4 were recovered from febrile United States and other United Nations military personnel in Haiti. We wondered whether risk factors for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) existed and, if so, were DHF cases occurring among Haitian children. Dengue transmission rates were studied in 210 school children (6-13 years old) resident in Carrefour Borough, Port-au-Prince, Haiti. When sera were tested for plaque-reduction neutralizing antibodies to DEN 1-4 viruses, nearly 85% had antibodies to two or more DEN serotypes. The annual transmission rate was estimated at 30%, a rate observed in countries endemic for DHE Haitian DEN 2 isolates were genotype I, which are repeatedly associated with DHF cases in Southeast Asia and American regions. Despite positive virologic pre-conditions, DHF cases were not recorded by experienced Port-au-Prince pediatricians. These observations, which are reminiscent of those in Africa, provide further evidence of a dengue resistance gene in black populations.

TI Incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum
   infection following curative therapy in adult residents of northern
   Ghana
AB Adult residents of holoendemic malaria regions in Africa have a naturally acquired immunity (NAI) to malaria that renders them more resistant to new infections, limits parasitemia, and reduces the frequency and severity of illness. Given such attributes, it is not clear how one might evaluate drug or vaccine efficacy in adults without serious confounding. To determine symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria attack rates in adults of northern Ghana, 197 men and women underwent curative therapy for any pre-existing malaria infections at the start of the high transmission (wet) season. They were monitored for first parasitemia and first clinical episode of infection by Plasmodium falciparum over a 20-week period (May-October 1996). The cumulative incidence of primary infection by P. falciparum was 0.98 and incidence density of infection was calculated to be 7.0 cases/person-year. Symptoms were reported by 19.5% of the individuals at the time of first recurrent parasitemia. Incidence of infection, parasite density, and the frequency of symptoms were comparable in males and females. The results suggest that NAI did not provide these adults with significant defense against rapid re-infection and suggest that this population-infection design could serve to demonstrate the efficacy of a drug or vaccine in preventing parasitemia.

TI Detection of eastern equine encephalitis virus in infected mosquitoes
   using a monoclonal antibody-based antigen-capture enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay
AB Surveillance of mosquito populations for virus activity is not often performed by small, vector-control districts because they do not have the financial resources to use virus isolation, or newer methods such as the polymerase chain reaction. Consequently, development and refinements of rapid, sensitive, and simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) applicable to a wide variety of public health settings are justified. We have developed an antigen-capture ELISA for the detection of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus in mosquitoes that uses both monoclonal capture and detector antibodies. The sensitivity of this assay is 4.0-5.0 log(10) plaque-forming units/ml, which is comparable to previously published EEE antigen-capture assays developed with polyclonal antibody reagents. This test identifies only North American strains of EEE virus and does not react with either western equine encephalitis or Highlands J viruses. Test sensitivity was enhanced by sonicating mosquito pools, treating them with Triton X-100, and increasing the time and temperature of antigen incubation. The conversion of this ELISA to a monoclonal antibody-based format should result in a readily standardizable and transferable assay that will permit laboratories lacking virus isolation facilities to conduct EEE virus surveillance.

This report describes the isolation of LAC virus from the exotic mosquito Aedes albopictus. The discovery of LAC virus in wild populations of Ae. albopictus, coupled with its expanding distribution in the southeastern United States, suggests that this mosquito may become an important accessory vector, potentially increasing the number of human cases in endemic foci or expanding the range of the disease.

We measured clonal variation and covariation in pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) for resistance to two parasitoid species (Aphidius ervi and A. eadyi) and a fungal pathogen (Erynia neoaphidis). We found significant clonal variation in resistance to all three natural enemies. We tested the hypothesis that there might be trade-offs (negative covariation) in defensive ability against different natural enemies, but found no evidence for this. All correlations in defensive ability were positive, that between the two parasitoid species significantly so. Defensive ability was not correlated with fecundity. A number of aphid clones were completely resistant to one parasitoid (A. eadyi), but a subset of these failed to reproduce subsequently. We discuss the factors that might maintain clonal variation in natural enemy resistance.

The strains were genetically typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated 16S-23S ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer regions (IGS-RFLP) and characterized by plasmid profiles and RFLP analysis of amplified nodABC genes. The R. leguminosarum bv. viciae population was dominated by the same group of strains (irrespective of the trap plant used). According to type richness, the genetic diversity of indigenous R. leguminosarum in the second year of restoration was lower than in the first year and it resembled that of the fallow field, except for plasmid types, in which it was higher than that of the fallow field. Some of the less frequent nodABC genotypes were associated with distinct chromosomal IGS genotypes and symbiotic plasmids (pSyms) of different sizes, indicating that horizontal transfer and rearrangements of pSym can occur in natural environments. However, the dominant pSym and chromosomal genotypes were strictly correlated suggesting a genetically stable persistence of the prevailing R. leguminosarum bv, viciae genotypes in the absence of its host plant.

Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 59 of 257 (23.0%) resident birds and none of 96 transient (migrating) birds sampled in early October. Species with the greatest seroprevalence were northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) (69.2%) and rock dove (Columba livia) (54.5%). House sparrows (Passer domesticus) and chickens (Gallus gallus) had lower than expected seroprevalences, 8.6% and 5.5%, respectively. The geographic distribution of seropositivity suggested focal transmission at several locations on the island. The concentration of seropositive birds among resident bird populations on Staten Island supports the concept that many birds survive WNV infection and that some of these play an important role in the WNV-bird-mosquito transmission cycle.

TI Risk Factors for Human Exposure to Raccoon Rabies During an Epizootic in
   Connecticut
AB The emergence of rabies among terrestrial wildlife poses increasing but poorly defined risks to people. In particular, events leading to human exposure to rabies virus via mammalian reservoirs remain elusive. Thus, we determined those risk factors associated with human exposure to rabies-positive animals during a raccoon rabies epizootic in Connecticut. Existing passive surveillance data on animal rabies tests in Connecticut from 1991 through 1994 were evaluated for demographic, ecological, and behavioral characteristics of human exposure. Of 2,525 rabies-positive terrestrial animals identified, human contact was reported on 556 occasions (22%) and involved at least 939 individuals. The annual incidence of exposure rose from none during 1985-1990 to 66 in 1991 and then averaged 291 during 1992-1994. Exposure was most often indirect in nature, involved a rabies-positive raccoon, was mediated through a domestic animal, and occurred most frequently either near or inside the home. These results suggest that human exposure to rabid animals represents a significant, reemerging public health concern in the United States. Analysis of the epizootiology of rabies infection and of individual exposure risks could reduce inappropriate administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis, as well as inform other proposed interventions.

TI Arbovirus infection increases with group size
AB Buggy Creek (BCR) virus is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that is naturally transmitted to its vertebrate host the cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) by an invertebrate vector, namely the cimicid swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius). We examined how the prevalence of the virus varied with the group size of both its vector and host. The study was conducted in southwestern Nebraska where cliff swallows breed in colonies ranging from one to 3700 nests and the bug populations at a site vary directly with the cliff swallow colony size. The percentage of cliff swallow nests containing bugs infected with BCR virus increased significantly with colony size at a site in the current year and at the site in the previous year. This result could not be explained by differences in the bug sampling methods, date of sampling, sample size of the bugs, age structure of the bugs or the presence of an alternate host, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Colony sites that were reused by cliff swallows showed a positive autocorrelation in the percentage of nests with infected bugs between year t and year t + 1, but the spatial autocorrelation broke down for year t + 2. The increased prevalence of BCR virus at larger cliff swallow colonies probably reflects the larger bug populations there, which are less likely to decline in size and lead to virus extinction. To the authors' knowledge this is the first demonstration of arbovirus infection increasing with group size and one of the few known predictive ecological relationships between an arbovirus and its vectors/hosts. The results have implications for both understanding the fitness consequences of coloniality for cliff swallows and understanding the temporal and spatial variation in arboviral epidemics.

AB Ixodes spinipalpis maintains Borrelia bissettii spirochetes in Colorado in a cycle involving wood rats and deer mice. This tick has been described as nidicolous, remaining either attached to its rodent hosts or in the rodent nest. Nidicolous ticks pose little risk of pathogen transmission to humans if they do not actively quest for hosts. To investigate the questing potential of I. spinipalpis, sentinel mice were placed in an area where I. spinipalpis had been commonly found on wood rats and deer mice. Concurrently, wild rodent populations were trapped and analyzed for Lyme disease spirochetes, the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (aoHGE), and Babesia microti. A total of 122 I. spinipalpis larvae and 10 nymphs were found on 19% of 244 sentinel mice. In addition, 4 sentinel mice became infested with Malaraeus telchinus or Orchopeas neotomae fleas. Questing I. spinipalpis were positively associated with woody shrubs and negatively associated with sunny and grassy areas. Four sentinel mice became infected with aoHGE after having been fed upon only by I. spinipalpis larvae. One sentinel mouse became infected with B. bissettii after having an I. spinipalpis nymph feed on it, and one sentinel mouse became coinfected with aoHGE and B. bissettii after it was fed upon by a single I. spinipalpis nymph. These sentinel mouse conversions suggest the possibility that the aoHGE is transovarially transmitted by I. spinipalpis, and that I. spinipalpis is capable of simultaneously transmitting B. bissettii and the aoHGE. The findings that I. spinipalpis quest away from rodent nests and will attach to and infect sentinel mice may be of public health importance. It suggests the potential transmission of the agents of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease to other hosts by I. spinipalpis, in regions of the western United States where Ixodes pacificus is not found.

TI Epidemiology of acute hepatitis in the Stann Creek District of Belize,
   Central America
AB Hepatitis is common in the Stann Creek District of southern Belize. To determine the etiologies, incidence, and potential risk factors for acute jaundice, we conducted active surveillance for cases. Cases of jaundice diagnosed by a physician within the previous 6 weeks were enrolled. Evaluation included a questionnaire and laboratory tests for hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, a blood film for malaria, and a serologic test for syphilis. Etiologies of jaundice among 62 evaluable patients included acute hepatitis A, 6 (9.7%), acute hepatitis B, 49 (79.0%), hepatitis non-A-E, 2 (3.2%), and malaria, 5 (8.1%). There were no cases of acute hepatitis E. One patient each with antibody to hepatitis C and D were detected. The annualized incidence of hepatitis A was 0.26 per 1,000. All cases of hepatitis A were in children 4-16 years of age. The annualized incidence of hepatitis B, 2.17 per 1,000, was highest in adults aged 15-44, years (4.4 per 1,000) and was higher in men (36 cases; 3.09 per 1,000) than women (13 cases; 1.19 per 1,000). Four (31%) of the women with hepatitis B were pregnant. The annualized incidence was significantly higher in Mestizo (6.18 per 1000) and Maya (6.79 per 1,000) than Garifuna (0.38 per 1,000) or Creole (0.36 per I, 000). Persons with hepatitis B were significantly more likely to be born outside of Belize (82%), had been in Belize < 5 years (73%), and lived and worked in rural areas (96%) than was the general population. Of those greater than or equal to 14 years of age with hepatitis B, only 36% were married. Few persons admitted to transfusions, tattoos, IV drug use, multiple sexual partners, visiting prostitutes, or sexually transmitted diseases. Only 1 of 49 had a reactive test for syphilis. Six patients were hospitalized (including 3 with acute hepatitis B and one with hepatitis A), and none to our knowledge died. Acute hepatitis B is the most common cause of viral hepatitis in the Stann Creek District, but the modes of transmission remain obscure. Infants, women attending prenatal clinics, and new workers are potential targets for immunization with hepatitis B vaccine.

TI Analysis of the peripheral immune response in patients with
   neurocysticercosis: Evidence for T cell reactivity to parasite
   glycoprotein and vesicular fluid antigens
AB In neurocysticercosis (NCC), it is thought that the long-term survival of the parasite within the human brain is due in part to the ability of the cestode to suppress the local immune response. When the parasite dies, the immunosuppression is apparently lost and a strong local inflammatory response then develops. In contrast, little is known about the immunologic response that may occur in the peripheral immune system of these patients. In this study, the status of the peripheral (extracerebral) cellular and humoral response was evaluated in patients with a history of NCC. The in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to mitogens and foreign antigens was similar in patients and controls. Importantly, a substantive response was elicited by two Taenia solium metacestode antigens. In addition, 8 of 10 patients had a detectable humoral response to the antigenic glycoproteins of the cestode. Considering both the cellular and humoral response, all of the patients with NCC presented an active peripheral immunity.

TI Evaluating the efficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes for the biological
   control of crop pests: A nonequilibrium approach
AB The efficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes for biological control is assessed using deterministic models. Typically, the examination of such models involves stability analyses to determine the long-term persistence of control. However, in agricultural systems, control is often needed within a single season. Hence, the transient dynamics of the systems were assessed under specific, shortterm control scenarios using stage-structured models. Analyses suggest that preemptive application may be the optimum strategy if nematode mortality rates are low; applying before pest invasion can result in greater control than applying afterward. In addition, repeated applications will suppress a pest, providing the application rate exceeds a threshold. However, the period between applications affects control success, so the economic injury level of the crop and the life history of the pest should be evaluated before deciding the strategy. In all scenarios, the most important parameter influencing control is the transmission rate. These findings are applicable to more traditional biological control agents (e.g., microparasites and parasitoids), and we recommend the approach adopted here when considering their practical use. It is concluded that it is essential to consider the specific crop and pest characteristics and the definition of control success before selecting the appropriate control strategy.

   falciparum malaria
AB We incorporate stochastic, density-dependent seasonal recruitment in adult Anopheles mosquito populations in a discrete-event model of Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission and find the probabilities of parasite extinction higher than with perennial transmission. Seasonal fluctuations in vector populations act to synchronize the dynamics of infection and immunity in host populations, leading to fluctuations in parasite prevalence greater than expected solely on the basis, of high- and low-season vector densities. This synchronization also biases frequencies of infection with multiple parasite phenotypes or genotypes.

TI Positive genetic correlation between parasite resistance and body size
   in a free-living ungulate population
AB Parasite resistance and body size are subject to directional natural selection in a population of feral Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the island of St. Kilda, Scotland. Classical evolutionary theory predicts that directional selection should erode additive genetic variation and favor the maintenance of alleles that have negative pleiotropic effects on other traits associated with fitness. Contrary to these predictions, in this study we show that there is considerable additive genetic variation for both parasite resistance, measured as fecal egg count (FEC), and body size, measured as weight and hindleg length, and that there are positive genetic correlations between parasite resistance and body size in both sexes. Body size traits had higher heritabilities than parasite resistance. This was not due to low levels of additive genetic variation for parasite resistance, but was a consequence of high levels of residual variance in FEC. Measured as coefficients of variation, levels of additive genetic variation for FEC were actually higher than for weight or hindleg length. High levels of additive genetic variation for parasite resistance may be maintained by a number of mechanisms including high mutational input, balancing selection, antagonistic pleiotropy, and host-parasite coevolution. The positive genetic correlation between parasite resistance and body size, a trait also subject to sexual selection in males, suggests that parasite resistance and growth are not traded off in Soay sheep, but rather that genetically resistant individuals also experience superior growth.

TI Does host genotype diversity affect the distribution of insect and
   disease damage in willow cropping systems?
AB 1. Planting of willow genotype mixtures for biomass production has been suggested as a non-chemical strategy for pest management. Basic information on spatial dynamics of important insects and pathogens is necessary for the effective deployment of host genotypes in a plantation. In 1998 and 1999 the degree and spatial distribution of damage by Melampsora spp. and Phratora vulgatissima were studied concurrently in a field trial containing monocultures of willow Salix genotypes with different willow rust and beetle susceptibilities, and two design mixtures (random or regular) of three or five genotypes.
   2. For both years, there was more rust and beetle damage on plants in monocultures than in mixtures. There were significant differences in the vertical distribution of beetle damage along stems between plantation designs for the 2 years, yet only in 1999 for rust. Rust severity along stems was significantly correlated between leaves, indicating localized spread of disease. In contrast, beetle damage severity along stems was weakly correlated between alternate leaves and leaves farther apart, suggesting beetle movement from tree to tree.
   3. In 1998, spatial distribution of rust was aggregated in 67% of plots studied and in 40% for beetles. There was no significant difference in the distribution of beetle damage between planting design, but rust was aggregated in 75% of mixtures and 33% of monocultures. While beetle damage distribution was similar between years, rust was aggregated in all monoculture plots but in only 8% of mixtures in 1999. The difference between years and design for rust was probably because of the later stage of rust development in 1999 and the delaying effect of mixtures on this development.
   4. In 1998, there were significant negative correlations between the extent of rust and beetle damage on individual trees. However, only 20% of plots showed a significant spatial dissociation between these two types of damage. There were fewer discernible interactions in 1999.
   5. Plantation design provides the basis for integrated control of rust and beetle damage within willow cropping systems by delaying the spread and development of both organisms. Both pest and disease can be assessed successfully simultaneously under field conditions, a major saving in human resources. Initial selection of willow mixture configuration should primarily take into account the effects of spatial design on rust development.

TI The role of Varroa and viral pathogens in the collapse of honeybee
   colonies: a modelling approach
AB 1. The ecto-parasitic mite Varroa destructor is a serious world-wide pest of the honeybee Apis mellifera and has being linked with the death of millions of colonies, although its role in colony death has remained elusive.
   2. A simulation model was developed to explain the link between the mite and collapse of the host bee colony, given that colony death does not always occur. We investigated the effects of two pathogens, deformed wing virus (DWV) and acute paralysis virus (APV), vectored by the mite, on the host colony.
   3. Two previously published simulation models, a bee and a mite, were combined and adapted for use in temperate climates with a variety of bee diseases. The model was constructed using Modelmaker(R) software, which allows the progression of a disease in the host colony to be followed daily.
   4. The population dynamics generated by the model were similar to those observed in a natural honeybee colony. When DWV- or APV-transmitting mites were introduced into the colony, its adult worker bee population collapsed either during winter or spring for DWV, or autumn to spring for APV. This corresponds well with field observations of colony death in Europe.
   5. The model revealed that MW initially had little effect on the colony but during late summer, as the population of DAW-transmitting mites increased, the virus caused a reduction in the number of healthy young bees entering the overwintering population. This imbalance in the age structure of the overwintering bees resulted in the eventual death of the colony during the winter or spring. As few as 2000-3600 mites irt autumn could kill a colony.
   6. In contrast, APV transmitted by Varroa was only able to kill the honeybee colony if a large. (10000+) mite population was already present when an overt APV infection occurred. It was difficult for APV to become established within the bee population due to it causing rapid host death.
   7. The model predicts that the less virulent DWV will become more widely established than the highly virulent APV, and that mite control measures need to be taken prior to the production of overwintering bees.

TI Early immunologic events in mucosal and systemic lymphoid tissues after
   intrarectal inoculation with simian immunodeficiency virus
AB The pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus transmission via the rectal route remains poorly understood. By use of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-rhesus macaque model and intrarectal inoculation with pathogenic SIVmac251, a significant increase was found in the percentage of CD11b(+) monocyte lineage cells expressing HLA-DR and/or B7-2 in local and peripheral immune inductive sites, but not in mucosal effector sites, as early as 7 days after inoculation and up to 50 days after inoculation. Moreover, at 21 and 50 days after inoculation, not only the gut but also the lung mucosa were depleted of CD4(+) T cells, which suggests that early loss of CD4(+) T cells may be a common feature of mucosal effector sites. These data suggest that, after intrarectal inoculation with SIV, early activation occurs within the monocyte lineage cell population at immunologic inductive sites, which is followed by a loss of CD4(+) T cells at local and distant mucosal effector sites.

Mosquitoes of the F2 generation (3 strains of Aedes aegypti and 10 strains of Ae. albopictus) were tested for oral susceptibility to dengue type 2 virus. Aedes aegypti was less susceptible to viral infection than Ae. albopictus. The genetic differentiation was less high between Ae. albopictus populations collected in agglomerations connected by highly frequented roads, indicating that human ground transportation favors mosquito dispersal. These results have implications for the ecology, pattern of migration, and relative importance in epidemic transmission of dengue viruses between the 2 Aedes species.

AB A population from the Witchereria bancrofti-endemic island of Mauke was reevaluated retrospectively by use of the Og4C3 circulating antigen (CAg) enzyme-link-ed immunosorbent assay to assess active infection in relation to host responses by age and gender. Use of microfilaremia (Mf) alone misclassified similar to 50% of infected people, although CAg and Mf levels were positively correlated. Levels of CAg peaked between those aged 31-60 years; men aged > 60 years had a significantly higher CAg prevalence (> 90%) than women. Filaria-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 reached maximum levels in both genders at age 51-60 years. By analysis of variance, both age and gender significantly influenced CAg and IgG4, with men having higher levels of both in the total Population. Individuals positive for CAg had significantly lower lymphocyte proliferation responses to parasite antigen than did CAg-negative people, regardless of clinical status. This study reemphasizes the importance of CAg measurements for accurately assessing filarial prevalence and clinical status and demonstrates the relationship between active infection and immune responsiveness.

TI Do arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi alter plant-pathogen relations?
AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonize roots of terrestrial plants and have been hypothesized to reduce susceptibility or to improve the vigor of hosts challenged by root pathogens. Meta-analysis was used to test whether a broad pattern exists in which AM fungi not only enhance plant growth but fundamentally alter plant-pathogen interactions. Data were gathered from studies published between 1970 and early 1998. In these studies nonmycorrhizal or mycorrhizal plants were untreated or challenged with root-infecting fungal pathogens or nematodes. Effect sizes for AM fungus treatment, pathogen treatment, and their interaction were calculated based on measures of average plant growth, pathogen growth. or AM colonization as reported by authors. AM fungus had a very large positive effect, and pathogens had a very large negative effect on plant growth, However, the interaction of AM fungi and pathogen depended upon the class of pathogen. AM fungi tended to decrease the harmful effects of fungal pathogens but to exacerbate the harmful effects of nematodes.
   Overall, inoculation with AM fungi had a large negative effect on growth of pathogens, but the outcome for nematodes depended upon mode of feeding. AM fungi harmed sedentary endoparasitic nematodes. AM fungi improved growth of migratory endoparasitic nematodes, but this outcome was not significant in an analysis limited to independent experiments. Reduced growth of pathogens in mycorrhizal plants may indicate increased host resistance. Alternatively, reduced AM colonization in pathogen-treated plants may suggest that root-infecting organisms compete for resources.
   Some experiments that did not meet criteria for meta-analysis were analyzed with chi (2) tests by calculating the proportion of experiments in which authors reported a significant pathogen effect in the absence vs. presence of AM fungi. AM fungi did not alter the effect of fungal pathogens but reduced the proportion of experiments in which nematodes depressed plant growth in a test limited to independent observations. Comparison of frequency distributions of effect sizes suggests that the difference in results for nematodes in the meta-analysis and the chi (2) tests stems from differences in the AM fungus-plant-pathogen systems examined in each approach rather than a statistical artifact.
   AM fungi reduced pathogen growth in similar to 50% of studies included in chi (2) tests, and this effect was similar for fungal vs. nematode pathogens and sedentary vs. migratory nematodes. Fungal pathogens reduced AM fungus growth more frequently than did nematodes. Both AM fungi and pathogens suffered reduced growth in 16% of experiments that assessed reciprocal effects. Reciprocal suppression was more common when the pathogen was a fungus, which may indicate that fungal pathogens are more likely than nematodes to compete with AM fungi.
   Almost all research on the effects of AM fungi on plant-pathogen relations has examined economically important species, in low-phosphorus soil, in greenhouse or microplot culture. Although these analyses revealed general patterns of the effects of AM fungi on plant-pathogen relations. research on a broader range of species over a wider range of environmental conditions is required to determine the domain for which these patterns apply.

TI Competitive interactions and persistence of two nematode species that
   parasitize Drosophila recens
AB Drosophila recens is parasitized in the wild by two nematodes, Howardula aoronymphium, a host generalist, and Parasitylenchus nearcticus, a host specialist known onlv from D. recens. In order to understand how these two parasite species coexist, we compared their ability to infect and grow in D. recens, their effects on host fecundity and survival, and whether one parasite species was competitively superior in double infections. The specialist nematode P. nearcticus had greater rates of infection and reproduction than the generalist H. aoronymphium, and completely sterilized females in single and mixed infections. The specialist was competitively superior in mixed infections, as generalist motherworms were significantly smaller than in single infections. These results suggest that P. nearcticus might competitively exclude AI. aoronymphium if D. recens were the only host available. It is likely that H. aoronymphium persists in D. recens by transmission from other, more suitable host species.

TI Disease persistence and apparent competition in a three-host community:
   an empirical and analytical study of large-scale, wild populations
AB 1. We investigated the effects of three types of host on the persistence of a tick-borne virus, using the grouse-hare-deer-tick-louping ill virus system of upland Britain. Each host differed in its interaction with the vector and pathogen. Grouse amplify virus only, deer amplify vector only and hares amplify both. Grouse alone suffer high virus-induced mortality.
   2. An analytical model of the system was parameterized using empirical data from two wild populations with different community structures. By changing relative host densities we examined the conditions under which the virus would persist and considered the possibility of parasite-mediated competition between hosts.
   3. Although deer alone and grouse alone were unable to maintain louping ill virus, a deer-grouse community usually allowed virus persistence because grouse transmitted virus while deer maintained the tick population. Since virus reduces grouse populations this is a type of apparent competition, and is unusual because deer do not amplify the virus.
   4. At very high deer densities, the opposite effect could occur, whereby virus died out because of 'wasted' infected tick bites on deer, that do not transmit virus (the dilution effect).
   5. In a hare-grouse two-host system virus usually persisted because hares amplified both the vector and virus (through non-viraemic transmission). Thus, apparent competition may occur between mountain hares and grouse.
   6. The addition of a third host type increased the likelihood of disease persistence. Hares added to the deer-grouse system rendered the dilution effect unlikely because of additional virus amplifiers. Deer added to the hare-grouse system meant virus almost always persisted because they amplified the vector.

TI Interaction of a host plant and its holoparasite: effects of previous
   selection by the parasite
AB If parasites decrease the fitness of their hosts one could expect selection for host traits (e.g. resistance and tolerance) that decrease the negative effects of parasitic infection. To study selection caused by parasitism, we used a novel study system: we grew host plants (Urtica dioica) that originated from previously parasitized and unparasitized natural populations (four of each) with or without a holoparasitic plant (Cuscuta europaea). infectivity of the parasite (i.e. qualitative resistance of the host) did not differ between the two host types. Parasites grown with hosts front parasitized populations had lower performance than parasites grown with hosts from unparasitized populations, indicating host resistance in terms of parasite's performance (i.e. quantitative resistance). However, our results suggest that the tolerance of parasitic infection was lower in hosts from parasitized populations compared with hosts from unparasitized populations as indicated by the lower above-ground vegetative biomass of the infected host plants from previously parasitized populations.

TI Social situation, sperm competition and sex allocation in a simultaneous

AB Evolutionary theory predicts an influence of mating group size on sex allocation in simultaneous hermaphrodites, We experimentally manipulated the social situation during reproduction in a simultaneous hermaphrodite parasite, the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus, by placing worms as singles, pairs or triplets into an in vitro system that replaces the final host. We then determined the reproductive allocation patterns after 24 h (i.e. before the start of egg release) and after 72 h (i.e. around the peak of egg release rate) using stereology. After 24 h, sex allocation strongly depended on worm volume (which is determined in the second intermediate host), but was not significantly affected by the social situation experienced during reproduction. After 72 h, worms in groups had less vesicular sperm (Le, sperm to be used in future inseminations) than singles. They also stored significantly more received sperm in their seminal receptacles than singles, suggesting that more sperm had been transferred in groups. Moreover, worms in triplets stored significantly more received sperm than worms in pairs, suggesting that they either mated more often and/or transferred more sperm per mating. This Suggests a behavioural response to the increased risk of sperm competition in triplets. We further discuss the relative importance of sex allocation decisions at different life-history stages.

TI Virulence and age at reproduction: new insights into host-parasite
   coevolution
AB We consider an explicit mutation-selection process to investigate the dynamics underlying the coevolution of parasite's virulence and host's prereproductive life span in a system with discrete generations. Conforming with earlier models, our model predicts that virulence generally increases with natural mortality of the host, and that a moderate increase in virulence selects for lower ages at reproduction. However, the epidemiological feedback in our model also gives rise to unusual and unexpected patterns. in particular, if virulence is sufficiently high the model can lead to a bifurcation pattern, where two strategies coexist in the host population. The first is to develop rapidly to reproduce before being infected. Individuals following this strategy suffer, however, from reduced fecundity. The second strategy is to develop much more slowly. Because of the high virulence, the effective period of transmission is short, so that a few slowly developing individuals escape infection. These individuals, although choosing a risky strategy, benefit from high fecundity.

Molecular epidemiology was useful in discerning routes of transmission in this outbreak.

TI Limitation of Trypanosoma brucei parasitaemia results from
   density-dependent parasite differentiation and parasite killing by the
   host immune response
AB In the bloodstream of its mammalian host, the 'slender' form of Trypanosoma brucei replicates extracellularly producing a parasitaemia. At high density, the level of parasitaemia is limited at a sublethal level by differentiation to the non-replicative 'stumpy' form and by the host immune response. Here, we derive continuous time equations to model the time-course, cell types and level of trypanosome parasitaemia, and compare the best fits,with experimental data. The best fits that were obtained favour a model in which both density-dependent trypanosome differentiation and host immune response have a role in limiting the increase of parasites, much poorer fits being obtained when differentiation and immune response are considered independently of one another. Best fits also favour a model in which the slender-to-stumpy differentiation progresses in a manner that is essentially independent of the cell cycle. Finally, these models also make the prediction that the density-dependent trypanosome differentiation mechanism can give rise to oscillations in parasitaemia level. These oscillations are independent of the immune system and are not due to antigenic variation.

A 2-class model suggested that positive results for any 2 virus markers defined the current HCV infection class, with an estimated prevalence of 22% (95% confidence interval, 18%-26%). The sensitivity for detection of current HCV infection was highest for anti-HCV (97%) and was more moderate for HCV RNA (91%) and HCV core protein (85%). The specificity for each marker was greater than or equal to 96%. In general, the association between demographic factors and current HCV infection status was strengthened by use of latent-class analysis that combined data for markers of HCV infection, when compared with results of logistic regression analysis for each marker separately.

In total, 200 subjects from a Japanese region where hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly endemic and 194 persons from a contiguous area where HCV is not endemic were tested for SENV-D and SENV-H DNA by polymerase chain reaction. SENV DNA was detected equally in subjects from each area (56% prevalence in the area of high endemicity vs. 61% in the nonendemic area). Age-specific prevalence of SENV was similar to that of TT virus, with equal distribution at all ages in both areas; HCV was predominant in the elderly population. Alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly associated with HCV viremia but not with SENV viremia. SENV is a common infection that appears to have transmission routes and age-related prevalence that are distinct from those of HCV. No evidence was found that SENV caused hepatitis or worsened the course of hepatitis C.

TI Interactions between sources of mortality and the evolution of parasite
   virulence
AB A well-known result from the theory of the evolution of virulence is the prediction that the virulence of a pathogen (i.e. the rate of parasite-induced host mortality) always evolves to higher levels when host background mortality rates increase. This prediction, however, is derived from models that assume that host mortality sources combine additively to determine the overall host mortality rate. In this paper, we suggest that such additivity is probably rare for many host-pathogen systems, and explore how the predictions for the evolution of virulence are altered when interactions between host mortality sources are incorporated into the theory. Our results indicate that if mortality-source interactions are sufficiently strong then the evolutionarily stable level of virulence can actually decrease as the background mortality rate increases. Consequently, a detailed mechanistic description of how parasites and other mortality sources combine to cause host mortality is required before reliable predictions about virulence evolution can be made. Moreover, mortality-source interactions make empirical comparisons of the virulence of different parasites a much more subtle issue.

TI Quantifying mosquito biting patterns on humans by DNA fingerprinting of
   bloodmeals
AB A major debate in infectious disease epidemiology concerns the relative importance of exposure and host factors, such as sex and acquired immunity, in determining observed age patterns of parasitic infection in endemic communities. Nonhomogeneous contact between hosts and vectors is also expected to increase the reproductive rate, and hence transmission, of mosquito-borne infections. Resolution of these questions for human parasitic diseases has been frustrated by the lack of a quantitative tool for quantifying the exposure rate of people in communities. Here, we show that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for amplifying and fingerprinting human DNA from mosquito bloodmeals can address this problem for mosquito-borne diseases. Analysis of parallel human and mosquito (resting Culex quinquefasciatus) samples from the same households in an urban endemic focus for bancroftian filariasis in South India demonstrates that a 9-locus radioactive short-tandem repeat system is able to identify the source of human DNA within the bloodmeals of nearly 80% of mosquitoes. The results show that a person's exposure rate, and hence the age and sex patterns of exposure to bites in an endemic community, can be successfully quantified by this method. Out of 276 bloodmeal PCR fingerprints, we also found that on average, 27% of the mosquitoes caught resting within individual households had fed on people outside the household. Additionally, 13% of mosquitoes biting within households contained blood from at least 2 people, with the rate of multiple feeding depending on the density of humans in the household. These complex vector feeding behaviors may partly account for the discrepancies in estimates of the infection rates of mosquito-borne diseases calculated parasitologically and entomologically, and they underline the potential of this tool for investigating the transmission dynamics of infection.

The overall prevalence in 970 people was 6.6% for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. There was an age effect on the prevalence of HBV infection, and a gradual increase in prevalence was observed in patients up to the age of 40 years. Those subjects with a history of dental procedures had a 2-fold higher risk for HBV infection (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.01-5.86), and there was a 74% increased risk for each blood product transfusion (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.09-2.77). Horizontal transmission seems to be the major source of endemicity in San Juanito because no woman was a chronic carrier. To lower HBV transmission rate, an adequate active screening program for blood donors should be implemented, together with a universal infant immunization program.

Over a 15-month period, we collected 1,090 small mammals at 12 locations representing 4 habitats common in the central Paraguayan chaco. Calomys laucha was common in agricultural habitats and uncommon in the native forest habitat. Populations of C laucha were greater during the dry season months and declined during the wet season. A total of 643 small mammals were tested for antibodies cross-reactive to Sin Nombre virus. All of the antibody-positive animals were C. laucha (crude antibody prevalence ratio 12.1% [25 of 206]). Antibody prevalence ratio increased with body size and was more common among male (18%; n = 115) than among female (4%; n = 96) vesper mice. Antibody prevalence ratio was highest among animals from cropland habitats (18% n = 72), followed by thorn scrub (13%; n = 46) and pastureland (7%; n = 81) and may be positively correlated to the proportion of C. laucha in the small mammal community. These data suggest that community-level dynamics, in addition to population-level dynamics, may be involved in the transmission of the virus through natural Populations of vesper mice.

TI Experimental infection of Australian brushtail possums, Trichosurus
   vulpecula (Phalangeridae : Marsupialia), with Ross River and Barmah
   Forest viruses by use of a natural mosquito vector system
AB Brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr, were experimentally infected with Ross River (RR) or Barmah Forest (BF) virus by Aedes vigilax (Skuse) mosquitoes. Eight of 10 animals exposed to RR virus developed neutralizing antibody, and 3 possums developed high viremia for < 48 hr after infection, sufficient to infect recipient mosquitoes. Two of 10 animals exposed to BF virus developed neutralizing antibody. Both infected possums maintained detectable neutralizing antibody to BF for at least 45 days after infection (log neutralization index > 2.0 at 45 days). Eight possums did not develop neutralizing antibody to BF despite exposure to infected mosquitoes. These results suggest that T. vulpecula may potentially act as a reservoir species for RR in urban areas. However, T. vulpecula infected with BF do not develop viremia sufficient to infect mosquitoes and are unlikely to be important hosts for BF.

TI Molecular epidemiology of malaria in Yaounde, Cameroon. VIII. Multiple
   Plasmodium falciparum infections in symptomatic patients
AB The extent of genetically distinct parasite populations coinfecting individual human hosts (i.e., multiplicity) was studied by polymerase chain reaction amplification of 3 polymorphic genetic markers, circumsporozoite protein and merozoite surface antigens (MSA) 1 and 2, in symptomatic children and adults and analyzed in relation with age and initial parasitemia. Of the total of 177 DNA samples analyzed (of which 115 were paired pre- and posttreatment samples), 101 (57%) were composed of multiclonal infections, with up to 7 distinguishable parasite populations. Among the 3 polymorphic markers, msa-2 yielded the highest proportion of clinical isolates with multiclonal populations. Patients with multiclonal infections before treatment had, on average, 2.9 genetically distinct parasite populations. The extent of multiplicity decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in recrudescent parasites, but not with reinfections, as compared with the pretreatment samples. Neither age (5-60 years) nor initial parasitemia was correlated with multiplicity. Further studies in different epidemiological settings are required to understand the role of multiclonal Plasmodium falciparum infections in influencing malaria transmission.

   the spatial distribution of Echinococcus multilocularis infections of
   foxes
AB To investigate the influence of environmental factors on the spatial epidemiology of infections with Echinococcus multilocularis, foxes were sampled in a focal endemic region in the Northwest of Brandenburg, Germany, and examined for infection by the parasite. The locations where foxes were obtained were recorded in a geographic information system database. Positions of infected and uninfected foxes were analyzed on the background of geographic vector data of water, settlements, streets, forests, crop, and pasture. Fox positions were allocated to different land-use classes by use of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite image. Infected foxes were more frequently shot near water, in areas of high soil humidity, and on pastures, suggesting that dryness may limit the tenacity of E. multilocularis oncospheres. Thus open landscapes with humid soil seem to be favorable for the life cycle of the parasite. In contrast, infected foxes were significantly underrepresented in forest areas.

TI Mechanisms of plant species coexistence: Roles of rhizosphere bacteria
   and root fungal pathogens
AB Two independent experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of rhizosphere bacteria on the growth of Anthoxanthum odoratum and Panicum sphaero-carpon. We tested whether host-specific populations of Bacillus mycoides affected the growth of their Anthoxanthum and Panicum hosts and whether host-specific differences in Bacillus populations modified the strong detrimental effect of the root fungal pathogen, Pythium macrosporum. Our results showed both positive and negative effects of Bacillus inoculation and that Anthoxanthum and Panicum plants responded differently to Bacillus isolates that originated from different host plants. Anthoxanthum grew relatively better with isolates from Panicum, while Panicum grew relatively better with isolates from Anthoxanthum, consistent with a negative feedback. In both experiments Pythium infection was detrimental to plant growth, and Panicum was more negatively affected by inoculation with Pythium. Overall, Bacillus ameliorated the pathogenic effect of Pythium. However, there was no evidence that host-specific Bacillus populations had different effects on the interaction between these plant species and Pythium. Both host-specific differences in rhizosphere bacteria and host-specific accumulation of a fungal pathogen can generate negative feedback between these two plant species.

TI Temporal and spatial dynamics of parasite richness in a Daphnia
   metapopulation
AB Several models have been suggested to explain variation in parasite richness among populations. Most of these models are based on epidemiological factors (population size, number of host species), biological factors (patch quality, interspecific competition) and the spatial and temporal structure of the host metapopulation. We studied the parasites of 137 rock pool populations of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna to determine the factors that account for total parasite richness, richness of endoparasites and epibionts, and the presence/absence patterns of individual parasite species. The rock pools of 86 of these populations have been studied since 1982, and it is known how long these pools have been continuously inhabited by Daphnia. By far the best predictor of total parasite richness was host population age, which explained similar to 50% of the variance. While endoparasite richness increased linearly with age over 16 yr, epibiont richness saturated similar to3 yr after pool colonization, which may be explained by the higher dispersal rate of epibionts. After we corrected for host population age, endoparasite richness was positively correlated with the water volume of the rock pool (an estimator for host population size), and epibiont richness was correlated with water conductivity. Pools with lower water conductivity (less influenced by the brackish water of the Baltic Sea) had more epibiont species. The local network size of the host metapopulation (local pool density and number of pools per island) hardly influenced parasite richness. There was also no strong indication of spatial effects (isolation by distance and island effects) on the parasite community. The factors that were correlated with species richness were, however, not the same as those related to the presence of single parasite species. At least for certain epibionts, it appears that presence/absence patterns were influenced by interspecific competition. In conclusion, our analysis shows that predictions derived from epidemiological and temporal models, but not from spatial models, can explain parasite richness patterns, despite apparent conflicting patterns found for individual, parasite species. Our analysis extends the scope of these models, which were previously supported mainly with helminths, to bacteria and protozoa.

TI Climate variation and incidence of Ross River virus in Cairns,
   Australia: A time-series analysis
AB In this study we assessed the impact of climate variability on the Ross River virus (RRv) transmission and validated an epidemic-forecasting model in Cairns, Australia. Data on the RRv cases recorded between 1985 and 1996 were obtained from the Queensland Department of Health. Climate and population data were supplied by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. The cross-correlation function (CCF) showed that maximum temperature in the current month and rainfall and relative humidity at a lag of 2 months were positively and significantly associated with the monthly incidence of RRv, whereas relative humidity at a lag of 5 months was inversely associated with, the RRv transmission. We developed autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models on the data collected between 1985 to 1994, and then validated the models using the data collected between:1995 and 1996. The results show that the relative humidity at a lag of 5 months (p < 0.001) and the rainfall at a lag of 2 months (p < 0.05) appeared to play significant roles in the transmission of RRv disc ease in Cairns. Furthermore, the regressive forecast curves were consistent with the pattern of actual values.

AB To quantify the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in children with tuberculosis (TB) a hospital-based, 1-year prospective, case-control study was performed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Children with TB were compared to a control group of children admitted for elective surgery. The control group was also compared to a recent census of the background population. The crude odds ratio for HIV infection was 8.6 (95% CI 2.2-73). After adjustment for possible confounders in a multivariate regression model, the odds ratio for HIV infection in children with TB was found to be 12.7 (95% CI 2.9-55). Of several independent determinants of TB assessed in the study, this association was the strongest. Until HIV transmission has reached its peak, an increasing burden of dual infection among Ethiopian children is to be expected.

   recovered from a recreational river source and an associated mussel
   (Mytilus edulis) bed in Northern Ireland
AB PCR-IMS was used to detect Cryptosporidium spp. in environmental water samples in Northern Ireland which had previously tested negative by a conventional IFA staining method. Oocysts of C. parvum detected in river water and final treated sewage effluent collected from various sites along the river Lagan were identified as genotype 2 (animal origin) based on polymorphisms observed at the thrombospondin related adhesion protein gene locus. Similarly, genotype I (human origin) oocysts of C. parvum were detected in the marine filter feeder mussel, Mytilus edulis, collected from the shores of Belfast Lough. Detection of the human genotype of Cryptosporidium in mussels destined for human consumption identifies the organism's serious potential as a foodborne pathogen. This work highlights the possible value of monitoring filter feeder systems, in conjunction with specific molecular epidemiological tools, as an alternative monitoring system for the parasite within the aquatic environment.

TI Parasite transmission modes and the evolution of virulence
AB A mathematical model is presented that explores the relationship between transmission patterns and the evolution of virulence for horizontally transmitted parasites when only a single parasite strain can infect each host. The model is constructed by decomposing parasite transmission into two processes, the rate of contact between hosts and the probability of transmission per contact. These transmission rate components, as well as the total parasite mortality rate, are allowed to vary over the course of an infection. A general evolutionarily stable condition is presented that partitions the effects of virulence on parasite fitness into three components: fecundity benefits, mortality costs. and morbidity costs. This extension of previous theory allows us to explore the evolutionary consequences of a variety of transmission patterns. I then focus attention on a special case in which the parasite density remains approximately constant during an infection, and I demonstrate two important ways in which transmission modes can affect virulence evolution: by imposing different morbidity costs on the parasite and by altering the scheduling of parasite reproduction during an infection. Both are illustrated with examples. including one that examines the hypothesis that vector-borne parasites should be more virulent than non-vector-borne parasites (Ewald 1994). The validity of this hypothesis depends upon the way in which these two effects interact, and it need not hold in general.

TI Simulation Studies of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus in South Florida
AB Two simulation models were used to investigate the epidemiology of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEv) in south Florida, one including sentinel hosts (chickens) and amplification hosts (wild birds), while the other one included age structure in the amplification host population. The overall population size of the vector, Culex nigripalpus, was a major factor in the likelihood of epizootics for both models, but the seasonal dynamics of the vector alone did not explain variation in transmission. Interactions between seasonal factors in the mosquito and reproduction in the wild amplification avian hosts appeared to be important in the likelihood of epizootics. Biased feeding between sentinel and amplification hosts affected the time course of virus prevalence and may have implications for the interpretation of sentinel data. The time of virus introduction strongly affected the timing of outbreaks but did not affect the likelihood of epizootics. In most cases, the outbreak occurred immediately after virus introduction; however, in some cases the outbreak was delayed until the mosquito population increased. This has implications for the timing of control strategies directed against mosquito populations.

TI Simulation Studies of St. Louis Encephalitis and West Nile Viruses: The
   Impact of Bird Mortality
AB West Nile virus (WNv) has spread through much of the eastern United States following its introduction in 1999, and arrived in Florida in 2001. Prior to its arrival, we anticipated that its transmission cycle was likely to be similar to that of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEv). However, high levels of avian mortality have been reported for WNv in the northeastern United States, and it was unknown how this would impact the transmission dynamics of WNv. Simulation models were used to compare the two viruses by considering the impact of bird mortality on the transmission dynamics of arboviruses in south Florida. Transmission models without disease-induced mortality (SLEv) were compared with models including disease-induced mortality (WNv). Disease-induced mortality depressed transmission, eliminating epizootics in two of 14 simulations that were epizootic without the additional mortality. In both models, the most important factor in the likelihood of epizootics was mosquito population size; the mosquito mortality rate was also important. The additional avian mortality altered the factors most important in the size and timing of epizootics, although it did not always directly affect the outcome of the simulations. In some cases, low-level transmission occurred prior to the epizootic peak. When disease-induced avian mortality was included in the simulations, appreciable numbers of dead birds occurred prior to high levels of infection in mosquitoes. This has implications for the use of dead birds as a surveillance tool monitoring the spread and transmission of WNv.

The prevalence of HEV infection was higher among swine farmers than among the comparison group (51.1% vs. 24.7%; prevalence ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-2.64). In multivariate analysis, HEV infection was associated with an occupational history of cleaning barns or assisting sows at birth (odds ratio [OR], 2.46; 95% CI, 1.52-4.01), years of occupational exposure (OR, 1.04 per year; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), and a history of drinking raw milk (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.08-2.40). HEV infection was not associated with civilian travel abroad or having piped water in the household. The increased prevalence of HEV infection among persons with occupational exposure to swine suggests animal-to-human transmission of this infection.

TI An unlikely partnership: parasites, concomitant immunity and host
   defence
AB Concomitant immunity (CI) against macroparasites describes a state of effective anti-larval immunity coupled with persistent adult infection. Experimental studies indicate that immunologically concealed adult worms might promote anti-larval immunity via the release of cross-reactive antigens, thus creating a barrier against continual infection and restricting burden size within the host. CI offers an important potential benefit to established worms by preventing overcrowding within the host. Thus, CI may be interpreted as akin to vaccination; relatively long-lived adult worms 'vaccinate' their host with larval surface antigens and so benefit from reduced conspecific competition. The shared responsibility for host vaccination among adult worms leads to a problem of collective action. Here, we build on earlier analytical findings about the evolutionary forces that shape cooperation among parasites in order to produce a stochastic simulation model of macroparasite social evolution. First, we theoretically investigate a parasite adaptation hypothesis of CI and demonstrate its plausibility under defined conditions, despite the possibility of evolutionary 'cheats'. Then we derive a set of predictions for testing the hypothesis that CI is partly a host-manipulative parasite adaptation. Evidence in support of this model would present an unusual case of adaptive population regulation.

This is the first report of isolation of C. burnetii from ticks by the shell-vial assay and by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of this pathogen in ticks. Of 141 ticks collected in Cyprus (Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Hyalloma spp.), 10% were found to be infected with C. burnetii. Three ticks were positive by hemolymph test, and 11 triturated ticks were positive by nested PCR. Three isolates were obtained by the centrifugation shell-vial technique. Analysis by PCR, then restriction fragment length polymorphism showed that the 3 Cyprus isolates had identical restriction profiles to reference strains Nine Mile and Q212. The methods described are useful in studying the epidemiology and ecology of C.

Single infected individuals of each Wolbachia group were encountered in nearly equal numbers. We screened 550 offspring from 80 field-collected mothers and found the transmission efficiency of group A Wolbachia to be 96.7% and that of group B Wolbachia to be 99.6%. Mothers that did not transmit both Wolbachia infections to all of their offspring were significantly larger in size than those with perfect transmission fidelity. We discuss our findings in relation to the prospects of the use of Wolbachia as a gene-driving mechanism.

AB The endosymbiotic bacteria in the genus Wolbachia have been proposed as a potential candidate to deliver pathogen-blocking genes into natural populations of medically important insects. The successful application of Wolbachia in insect vector control depends on the ability of the agent to successfully invade and maintain itself at high frequency under field conditions. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of Wolbachia infections in a field population of the Wolbachia-superinfected mosquito Aedes albopictus. A field prevalence of 100% (n = 1,016) was found in a single population in eastern Thailand via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of Wolbachia both from individual parent females and their corresponding F1 offspring. This is the first report of accurate Wolbachia prevalence in a field population of an insect disease vector. The prevalence of superinfection was estimated to be 99.41%. All single-infected individual mosquitoes (n = 6) were found to harbor group A Wolbachia. For this particular population, none was found to be single-infected with group B Wolbachia. Our results also show that PCR testing of field materials alone without checking F1 offspring overestimated the natural prevalence of single infection. Thus, the confirmation of infection status by means of F1 offspring was critical to the accurate estimates of Wolbachia prevalence under field conditions.

   rodent parasitized by fleas
AB The pattern of parasitism of the flea species Xenopsylla dipodilli and Nosopsyllus iranus theodori on the desert rodent species Gerbillus dasyurus was studied to test the hypothesis that the relationships between flea abundance and host density conform to pre-existing models of R. M. Anderson and R. M. May, with the correction that the density of those host individuals that possess permanent burrows (residents) is substituted for the overall host density. It was predicted that: (1) the intensity of flea infestation would increase in curvilinear fashion with increase of host density to a plateau that would be attained at a lower level of host density than would be expected from the basic model, and (2) the prevalence of flea infestation plotted against host density would be hump-shaped. The results indicated that intensity of flea infestation increased in either curvilinear fashion to an asymptote (for X. dipodilli) or linearly (for N. i. theodori) with increase of host density. As host density increased, the prevalence of infestation changed either unimodally (X. dipodilli) or logarithmically (N. i. theodori). In addition, there was a positive relationship between the mean number of fleas per host and the percentage of hosts infested. Both basic and corrected models describing the relationships between flea burden and host density fit the observational data well. However. simulations of the fraction of resident hosts demonstrated that this parameter influences the relationship between host density and flea burden only when residents comprise less than or equal to50% of all host individuals.

TI Co-occurrence of ectoparasites of marine fishes: a null model analysis
AB We used null model analysis to test for nonrandomness in the structure of metazoan ectoparasite communities of 45 species of marine fish. Host species consistently supported fewer parasite species combinations than expected by chance, even in analyses that incorporated empty sites. However, for most analyses, the null hypothesis was not rejected, and co-occurrence patterns could not be distinguished from those that might arise by random colonization and extinction. We compared our results to analyses of presence-absence matrices for vertebrate taxa, and found support for the hypothesis that there is an ecological continuum of community organization. Presence-absence matrices for small-bodied taxa with low vagility and/or small populations (marine ectoparasites, herps) were mostly random, whereas presence-absence matrices for large-bodied taxa with high vagility and/or large populations (birds, mammals) were highly structures. Metazoan ectoparasites of marine fishes fall near the low end of this continuum, with little evidence for nonrandom species co-occurrence patterns.

AB Little is known about how, the risk of disease varies across species and its consequences for host defenses, including the immune system. I obtained mean values of basal white blood cells (WBC) from 100 species of primates to quantify disease risk. based on the assumption that higher baseline WBC counts will be found in species that experience greater risk of acquiring infectious disease. These data were used to investigate four hypotheses: disease risk is expected to increase with 1) group size and population density: (2) greater contact with soil-borne pathogens during terrestrial locomotion; (3) a slow life history: and (4) increased mating promiscuity. After controlling for phylogeny, WBC counts increased with female mating promiscuity, as reflected in discrete categories of partner number. relative testes mass. and estrous duration. By comparison, the social. ecological, and life-history hypotheses were unsupported in comparative tests. In terms of confounding variables. some WBC types were associated with body mass or activity period. but these variables could not account for the association with mating promiscuity. Several factors may explain why hypotheses involving social, ecological. and life-history factors went unsupported in these tests. including the role of behavioral counterstrategies to disease, restrictions on female choice of mating partners. and the effect of transmission mode on parasite strategies and host defenses.

TI The evolutionary significance of parasitism: do parasite-driven genetic
   dynamics occur ex silico?
AB It has long been recognized that reciprocal antagonism might lock host and parasite populations into a process of constant change, adapting and reacting in open-ended coevolution. A significant body of theory supports this intuition: dynamic genetic polymorphisms are a common outcome of computer simulations of host-parasite coevolution, These in silico experiments have also shown that dynamical interactions could be responsible for high levels of genetic diversity in host populations, and even be the principle determinant of rates of genetic recombination and sexuality. The evolutionary significance of parasitism depends on the strength and prevalence of parasite-mediated selection in nature. Here I appraise whether parasitism is a pervasive agent of evolutionary change by detailing empirical evidence for selection. Although there is considerable evidence of genetic variation for resistance, and hence the potential for selection, direct observation of parasite-driven genetic change is lacking.

TI The evolutionary transition to coloniality promotes higher blood
   parasitism in birds
AB Parasitism has been argued as one of the major costs of breeding sociality in birds. However, there is no clear evidence for an increased parasite pressure associated with the evolutionary transition from solitary to colonial breeding. I used the pairwise comparative method to test whether colonial bird species incur in a greater risk of infection and if they must to face with a greater diversity of blood parasites (Haematozoa), by comparing pairs of congeners that included one solitary and one colonial breeding species. The richness, both in terms of number of species and number of genera, as well as the prevalence of blood parasites resulted higher in colonial species than in their solitary breeding sisters, while controlling for differences in research effort and other potentially confounding effects. These results point towards higher transmission rates of blood parasites among colonial hosts. Given the detrimental effects of blood parasites on their host fitness, the higher risk of infection and the exposition to a more diverse parasite fauna may have imposed an important cost associated to the evolution of avian coloniality. This may help to explain why colonial species have larger immune system organs, as well as to explore differences in other host life history traits potentially shaped by blood parasites.

TI The population genetics of host specificity: genetic differentiation in
   dove lice (Insecta : Phthiraptera)
AB Some species of parasites occur on a wide range of hosts while others are restricted to one or a few host species. The host specificity of a parasite species is determined, in part, by its ability to disperse between host species. Dispersal limitations can be studied by exploring the genetic structure of parasite populations both within a single species of host and across multiple host species. In this study we examined the genetic structure in the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of two genera of lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) occurring on multiple sympatric species of doves in southern North and Central America. One genus, Columbicola, is generally less host-specific than the other, Physconelloides. For both genera we identified substantial genetic differentiation between populations of conspecific lice on different host species, generally 10-20% sequence divergence. This level of divergence is in the range of that often observed between species of these two genera. We used nested clade analysis to explore fine scale genetic structure within species of these feather lice. We found that species of Physconelloides exhibited more genetic structure, both among hosts and among geographical localities, than did species of Columbicola. In many cases, single haplotypes within species of Columbicola are distributed on multiple host species. Thus, the population genetic structure of species of Physconelloides reveals evidence of geographical differentiation on top of high host species specificity. Underlying differences in dispersal biology probably explain the differences in population genetic structure that we observed between Columbicola and Physconelloides.

   virus type 1 among injecting drug users in Bangkok, Thailand
AB The Bangkok (Thailand) Metropolitan Administration cohort of injecting drug users (IDUs) consisted of 1,209 IDUs initially seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were followed from 1995 to 1998 at 15 Administration drug treatment clinics. At enrollment and approximately every 4 months thereafter, participants were assessed for HIV seropositivity. As of December 1998, there were 133 HIV type 1 seroconversions and approximately 2,300 person-years of follow-up. Of the 133 observed seroconversions, specimens from 126 persons were available for subtyping (27 subtype B, 99 subtype E). In this analysis, the authors assessed differences in subtype-specific transmission while controlling for important risk factors. The methodology used accounts for left truncation, interval censoring, and competing risks as well as for time-varying covariates such as each IDU's history of reported frequency of injection and of incarceration. Using plausible epidemiologic assumptions and controlling for behavioral risks, the authors found that a significantly higher transmission probability was associated with subtype E compared with subtype B in this population. Since many epidemiologic, virologic, and host factors can influence HIV transmission, it was difficult to conclude whether these differences in transmission probabilities were due to biologic properties associated with subtype.

AB Fifty children from 9 families were enrolled in a longitudinal study of' 8 months to evaluate individual levels of Plasmodium falciparum density in blood during asymptomatic infections. Individual parasite densities were adjusted for age and date of blood intake. The arithmetic means of these adjusted parasite densities (MAPD) were not influenced by sickle cell trait nor by G6PD enzyme activity. On the contrary, family analysis revealed the presence of similar MAPD values according to the sibships. Moreover, sibships frequently infected with P. malariae exhibited the highest P. falciparum MAPDs. The difference in aggressiveness of malaria vectors between the northern and southern halves of the village did not explain the distribution of MAPD, nor did it explain the differences in mean frequency of P. malariae infection among the sibships. We conclude that the familial characteristic of susceptibility to both P. falciparum and P. malariae infections is more likely influenced by the host's genetic background differences in the levels of malaria transmission.

TI Evolutionary dynamics of prey exploitation in a metapopulation of
   predators
AB In well-mixed populations of predators and prey, natural selection favors predators with high rates of prey consumption and population growth. When spatial structure prevents the populations from being well mixed, such predators may have a selective disadvantage because they do not make full use of the prey's growth capacity and hence produce fewer propagules. The best strategy then depends on the degree to which predators can monopolize the exploitation of local prey populations, which in turn depends on the spatial structure, the number of migrants, and, in particular, the stochastic nature of the colonization process. To analyze the evolutionary dynamics of predators in a spatially structured predator-prey system, we performed simulations with a metapopulation model that has explicit local dynamics of nonpersistent populations, keeps track of the number of emigrants entering the migration pool, assumes individuals within local populations as well as within the migration pool to be well mixed, and takes stochastic colonization into account. We investigated which of the predator's exploitation strategies are evolutionarily stable and whether these strategies minimize the overall density of prey, as is the case in Lotka-Volterra-type models of competitive exclusion. This was analyzed by pairwise invasibility plots based on short-term simulations and tested by long-term simulation experiments of competition between resident and mutant predator-types that differed in one of the following parameters: the prey-to-predator conversion efficiency, the per capita prey consumption rate, or the per capita emigration rate from local populations. In addition, we asked which of these three strategies are most likely to evolve. Our simulations showed that under selection for conversion efficiency the predator-prey system always goes globally extinct yet persists under selection for consumption or emigration rates and that the evolutionarily stable (ES) exploitation strategies do not maximize local population growth rates. The most successful exploitation strategy minimizes the overall density of prey but does not make it settle exactly at the minimum. The system did not settle at the point where the mean time to co-invasion (i.e., immigration of a second predator in a local prey population) equals the mean local interaction time (an idea borne out from studies on host exploitation strategies in host-pathogen systems) but rather where the mean time to co-invasion was larger. The ES exploitation strategies represent more prudent strategies than the ones that minimize prey density. Finally, we show that-compared to consumption-emigration is a more likely target for selection to achieve prudent exploitation and that prudent exploitation strategies can evolve only provided the prey-to-predator conversion efficiency is subject to constraints.

TI Within-host population dynamics and the evolution of microparasites in a
   heterogeneous host population
AB Why do parasites harm their hosts? The general understanding is that if the transmission rate and virulence of a parasite are linked, then the parasite must harm its host to maximize its transmission. The exact nature of such trade-offs remains largely unclear, but for vertebrate hosts it probably involves interactions between a microparasite and the host immune system. Previous results have suggested that in a homogeneous host population in the absence of super- or coinfection, within-host dynamics lead to selection of the parasite with an intermediate growth rate that is just being controlled by the immune system before it kills the host (Antia et al. 1994). In this paper, we examine how this result changes when heterogeneity is introduced to the host population. We incorporate the simplest form of heterogeneity-random heterogeneity in the parameters describing the size of the initial parasite inoculum. the immune response of the host, and the lethal density at which the parasite kills the host. We find that the general conclusion of the previous model holds: parasites evolve some intermediate growth rate. However, in contrast with the generally accepted view. we find that virulence (measured by the case mortality or the rate of parasite-induced host mortality) increases with heterogeneity. Finally, we link the within-host and between-host dynamics of parasites. We show how the parameters for epidemiological spread of the disease can be estimated from the within-host dynamics, and in doing so examine the way in which trade-offs between these epidemiological parameters arise as a consequence of the interaction of the parasite and the immune response of the host.

TI Association between surfactant protein A gene locus and severe
   respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants
AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes seasonal epidemics of bronchiolitis among susceptible infants. Surfactant protein A (SP-A), a lung C-type lectin involved in innate host defense, opsonizes RSV and enhances phagocytosis. The candidate gene approach was used to investigate association of SP-A polymorphism with susceptibility to severe RSV infection. Genotype analysis was done for 86 infants with severe RSV infection and 95 matched control subjects. A significant difference in the frequency of SP-A2 was observed. The SP-A2 allele 1A(3) was overrepresented in RSV-infected infants, compared with control subjects (5% vs. 0.5%; P = .006), whereas allele 1A was underrepresented (1% vs. 6%; P = .011). The allele pool in which lysine was amino acid 223 was overrepresented in infants with severe RSV infection (28% vs. 18%; P = .023), whereas the allele pool in which proline was amino acid 99 was underrepresented (5% vs. 16%; P = .001). These results indicate that a genetic association exists between SP-A gene locus and severe RSV infection.

TI Stage of the epidemic and viral phenotype should influence
   recommendations regarding mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1
AB This article argues for a new approach to use of nevirapine in the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV-1. Existing antenatal surveillance should be strengthened to plan geographical allocation, and subsequent evaluation, of a "nevirapine plus" programme. As the epidemic evolves the programme should also and, ideally, care should be tailored to individual women. Underpinning this approach is evidence that a more virulent viral phenotype appears in many patients with advanced HIV-1 infection. This phenotype will become more common at the population level as the epidemic progresses. As efficacy of zidovudine correlates with viral phenotype, and use of the drug may alter phenotype, there is an urgent need for a replacement that is safe to use with nevirapine.

AB Many pathogens exhibit antigenic diversity and elicit strain-specific immune responses. This potential for cross-immunity structure in the host resource motivates the development of mathematical models, stressing competition for susceptible hosts in driving pathogen population dynamics and genetics. Here we establish that certain model formulations exhibit characteristics of prototype pattern-forming systems, with pathogen population structure emerging as three possible patterns: (i) incidence is steady and homogeneous; (ii) incidence is steady but heterogeneous; and (iii) incidence shows oscillatory dynamics, with travelling waves in strain-space. Results are robust to strain number, but sensitive to the mechanism of cumulative immunity.

TI Dose-dependent infection rates of parasites produce the Allee effect in
   epidemiology
AB In many epidemiological models of microparasitic infections it is assumed that the infection process is governed by the mass-action principle, i.e. that the infection rate per host and per parasite is a constant. Furthermore, the parasite-induced host mortality (parasite virulence) and the reproduction rate of the parasite are often assumed to be independent of the infecting parasite dose. However, there is empirical evidence against those three assumptions: the infection rate per host is often found to be a sigmoidal rather than a linear function of the parasite dose to which it is exposed; and the lifespan of infected hosts as well as the reproduction rate of the parasite are often negatively correlated with the parasite dose. Here, we incorporate dose dependences into the standard modelling framework for microparasitic infections, and draw conclusions on the resulting dynamics. Our model displays an Allee effect that is characterized by an invasion threshold for the parasite. Furthermore, in contrast to standard epidemiological models a parasite strain needs to have a basic reproductive rate that is substantially greater than 1 to establish an infection. Thus, the conditions for successful invasion of the parasite are more restrictive than in mass-action infection models. The analysis further suggests that negative correlations of the parasite dose with host lifespan and the parasite reproduction rate helps the parasite to overcome the invasion constraints of the Allee-type dynamics.

   their carbohydrate epitope GalNAc beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-2Fuc alpha
   1-3)GlcNAc
AB To investigate the interactions of glycoconjugates with the innate immune system, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with glycolipids derived from Schistosoma mansoni eggs and worms and with biochemically synthesized neoglycoconjugates. Egg glycolipids stimulated the production of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-a in monocytes, whereas worm glycolipids failed to do so. When monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize defined carbohydrate epitopes were used, the binding of a GalNAcbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-2Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAc (LDN-DF) reactive antibody was pronounced on egg glycolipids but was absent on worm glycolipids. The binding of antibodies that recognize Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAc (LewisX), GalNAcbeta1-4GlcNAc (LDN), and GalNAcbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAc (LDN-F) was comparable for both preparations. Cytokine production in response to neoglycoconjugates containing enzymatically synthesized glycans also was measured. The LDN-DF neoglycoconjugate was the most potent cytokine inducer, which indicates that this difucosylated glycan can act at the host-parasite interface and can trigger innate immune responses.

TI Mixed inoculation alters infection success of strains of the endophyte
   Epichloe bromicola on its grass host Bromus erectus
AB Within-host competition in multiply infected hosts is considered an important component of host-parasite interactions, but experimental studies on the dynamics of multiple infections are still rare. We measured the infection frequencies of four strains of the fungal endophyte Epichloe bromicola on two genotypes of its host plant Bromus erectus after single- and double-strain inoculation. Double-strain inoculations resulted in fewer double, but more single, infections than expected on the basis of infection frequencies in single-strain inoculations. In most cases, only one of the two strains established an infection, and strains differed in their overall competitive ability. This pattern resembles the mutual exclusion scenarios in some theoretical models of parasite evolution. In addition, competitive ability varied with host genotype, which may represent a mechanism for the coexistence of strains in a population. Hence, considering the genetic variation in both host and parasite may be important for a better understanding of within-host dynamics and their role in epidemiology or (co)evolution.

TI Parasite-induced maternal response in a natural bird population
AB 1. The timing and mechanism of the maternal response to ectoparasites is investigated in a host-parasite system consisting of great tits and a haematophageous ectoparasite, the hen flea. It has been demonstrated previously that a maternal response to this parasite enhances survival and fertility of the offspring. This may have arisen by either a maternally transferred protection via the egg, or by a parental response affecting the common rearing environment after hatching. Two experiments aimed to differentiate between the two possibilities are reported here.
   2. First, mothers were either exposed to or kept free of ectoparasite during egg production, and subsequently the newborn nestlings were cross-fostered between the two treatments. The experimental design discriminates as to whether the maternal effect arises before or after hatching. Within the same nest, the nestlings originating from previously exposed mothers grew faster than nestlings of unexposed mothers.
   3. Secondly, we tested for the transfer of parasite-induced immunoglobulins (IgG) via the egg. Mothers were kept free of ectoparasites until they had laid the first egg and were then either exposed to or kept free of ectoparasites to the end of laying. The IgG-concentration significantly increased from the first to the eighth egg of exposed mothers, but not in eggs of unexposed ones.
   4. In summary, the first experiment shows that ectoparasites can induce a beneficial maternal response at egg laying, and the second experiment suggests that the maternal effect is due to immunoglobulins transferred via the egg. Maternal responses to other parasites, e.g. blood parasites, are known for chicken in captivity, In natural populations of birds both the timing and mechanism of the response are poorly understood, despite their relevance for behavioural and population ecology.

TI Evolutionary aspects of the metapopulation dynamics of Biomphataria
   pfeifferi, the intermediate host of Schistosoma mansoni
AB Combining genetic and demographic data is a powerful approach to study adaptation process and evolutionary forces acting in natural populations. We focus on the freshwater snail Biomphalaria pfeifferi, the intermediate host of Schistosoma mansoni. Twenty-one populations sampled in the south of Madagascar were genotyped at six microsatellite loci. Demographic parameters and parasitic prevalence were estimated monthly over the year preceding the genetic sampling. Our results indicate that populations experience recurrent bottlenecks and size fluctuations, which strongly depresses the genetic diversity within population. The recolonization of depleted sites involves genetically differentiated immigrants. We detected frequent migration events along rivers and rare migration events between watersheds. This explains the high level of differentiation observed among populations. The negative regression observed between the prevalence of S. mansoni and the genetic diversity of B. pfeifferi populations indicates that host consanguinity may affect prevalence through the genetic mechanisms involved in resistance. Coevolutionary outcomes are also influenced by the relative migration rates of snails and flukes, but the parasite local adaptation may be prevented by rare long distance dispersal in snails and the phylogeographical patterns of colonization of both hosts and snails.

   in human trichuriasis: The importance of IgE
AB The cytokine and antibody response to Trichuris trichiura infection was determined for 96 persons living in an area where the parasite is highly endemic and infection exhibits a convex age intensity profile. In response to stimulation with T. trichiura antigen, a small proportion of the study group produced interleukin (IL)-4 (7%), IL-9 (5%), and IL-13 (17%). A larger proportion produced IL-10 (97%), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (93%), and interferon (IFN)-gamma (32%). The levels of TNF-alpha (P=.016) and IFN-gamma (P=.012) significantly increased with age, suggesting a switch to a more chronic infection phenotype. The predominant parasite-specific antibodies produced were IgG1, IgG4, IgA, and IgE. Unlike the IgG subclasses and IgA, parasite-specific IgE correlated negatively with infection intensity, as defined by egg output (P=.008), and positively with host age (P=.010). These findings suggest a mixed cytokine response in trichuriasis and an IgE-associated level of protection.

TI Comparative population structure and genetic diversity of Arceuthobium
   americanum (Viscaceae) and its Pinus host species: insight into
   host-parasite evolution in parasitic angiosperms
AB In a recent study we revealed that the parasitic angiosperm Arceuthobium americanum is comprised of three distinct genetic races, each associated with a different host in regions of allopatry. In order to assess the role of host identity and geographical isolation on race formation in A. americanum, we compared the genetic population structure of this parasite with that of its three principal hosts, Pinus banksiana, Pinus contorta var. latifolia and Pinus contorta var. murrayana. Despite the fact that A. americanum was divided into three genetic races, hosts were divided into only two genetic groups: (i) Pinus banksiana and hybrids, and (ii) P. contorta var. latifolia and var. murrayana. These findings suggest that factors such as geographical isolation and adaptation to different environmental conditions are important for race formation in the absence of host-driven selection pressures. To assess factors impacting population structure at the fine-scale, genetic and geographical distance matrices of host and parasite were compared within A. americanum races. The lack of a relationship between genetic and geographical distance matrices suggests that isolation-by-distance plays a negligible role at this level. The effect of geographical isolation may have been diminished because of the influence of factors such as random seed dispersal by animal vectors or adaptation to nongeographically patterned environmental conditions. Host-parasite interactions might also have impacted the fine-scale structure of A. americanum because the parasite and host were found to have similar patterns of gene flow.

TI Vertical transmission of sublethal granulovirus infection in the Indian
   meal moth, Plodia interpunctella
AB Knowledge of the mechanisms of pathogen persistence in relation to fluctuations in host density is crucial to our understanding of disease dynamics. In the case of insect baculoviruses, which are typically transmitted horizontally via a lifestage that can persist outside the host, a key issue that remains to be elucidated is whether the virus can also be transmitted vertically as a sublethal infection. We show that RNA transcripts for the Plodia interpunctella GV granulin gene are present in a high proportion of P. interpunctella insects that survive virus challenge. Granulin is a late-expressed gene that is only transcribed after viral genome replication, its presence thus strongly indicates that viral genome replication has occurred. Almost all insects surviving the virus challenge tested positive for viral RNA in the larval and pupal stage. However, this proportion declined in the emerging adults. Granulin mRNA was also detected in both the ovaries and testes, which may represent a putative mechanism by which reduced fecundity in sublethally affected hosts might be manifested. RNA transcripts were also detected in 60-80% of second-generation larvae that were derived from mating surviving adults, but there was no difference between the sexes, with both males and females capable of transmitting a sublethal infection to their offspring. The data indicate that low-level persistent infection, with at least limited gene expression, can occur in P. interpunctella following survival of a,granulovirus challenge. We believe that this is the first demonstration of a persistent, sublethal infection by a baculovirus to be initiated by a sublethal virus dose. We hypothesize that the 'latent' baculovirus infections frequently referred to in the literature may also be low level persistent, sublethal infections resulting from survival from initial baculovirus exposure.

TI Parasite Polymorphism May Serve to Enhance Fitness in Different Host
   Environments
AB Phenotypic expression of trans-sialidase (TS) by Trypanosoma cruzi (Silvio strain) is restricted to a subpopulation (20-30%) of broad trypomastigotes (TS+ parasites), while the larger subpopulation of slender trypomastigotes lacks TS expression (TS- parasites). Rhodnius prolixus nymphs were infected with fractionated T. cruzi parasite populations (Silvio strain). Bugs ingesting TS- parasites produced significantly higher parasite loads than bugs ingesting either TS+ parasites or unfractionated populations. The addition of 1.0 mu g of TS monoclonal antibody (TCN-2)/ml of blood meal to TS+ populations increased parasite populations to levels comparable to those of TS- populations. In contrast, the addition of exogenous TS to TS- parasite blood meals significantly reduced parasite loads to levels comparable to bugs ingesting TS+ parasites. These results suggest that T. cruzi trypomastigote polymorphism may serve to enhance survival in different host environments.

TI The effect of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility on host
   population size in natural and manipulated systems
AB Obligate, intracellular bacteria of the genus Wolbachia often behave as reproductive parasites by manipulating host reproduction to enhance their vertical transmission. One of these reproductive manipulations, cytoplasmic incompatibility, causes a reduction in egg-hatch rate in crosses between individuals with differing infections. Applied strategies based upon cytoplasmic incompatibility have been proposed for both the suppression and replacement of host populations. As Wolbachia infections occur within a broad range of invertebrates, these strategies are potentially applicable to a variety of medically and economically important insects. Here, we examine the interaction between Wolbachia infection frequency and host population size. We use a model to describe natural invasions of Wolbachia infections, artificial releases of infected hosts and releases of sterile males, as part of a traditional sterile insect technique programme. Model simulations demonstrate the importance of understanding the reproductive rate and intraspecific competition type of the targeted population, showing that releases of sterile or incompatible individuals may cause an undesired increase in the adult number. In addition, the model suggests a novel applied strategy that employs Wolbachia infections to suppress host populations. Releases of Wolbachia-infected hosts can be used to sustain artificially an unstable coexistence of multiple incompatible infections within a host population, allowing the host population size to be reduced, maintained at low levels, or eliminated.

TI The evolution of risky behaviour in the presence of a sexually
   transmitted disease
AB Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are widespread in nature, often sterilizing their hosts or causing other pathogenic effects. Despite this, there is a widespread occurrence of behaviours that are likely to increase the risk to an individual of contracting an STD. Here, we examine the evolution of behaviours such as promiscuity or mate choice that increase the risk of contracting an STD, but also provide a fitness benefit. As might be expected, the balance between risk and fitness benefit defines the optimal strategy, but this relationship is not straightforward. In particular, we often predict the coexistence of highly risky and highly risk-averse individuals. Surprisingly, very safe strategists that only suffer a small cost will tend to coexist with highly risky strategists rather than outcompete them as might have been expected. Rather than selecting for monogamy or for reduced mate choice, therefore, the presence of an STD may often lead to variability in either promiscuity or mate choice.

TI Deleterious Wolbachia in the ant Formica truncorum
AB Wolbachia is a maternally inherited bacterium that may manipulate the reproduction of its arthropod hosts. In insects, it is known to lead to inviable matings, cause asexual reproduction or kill male offspring, all to its own benefit, but to the detriment of its host. In social Hymenoptera, Wolbachia occurs widely, but little is known about its fitness effects. We report on a Wolbachia infection in the wood ant Formica truncorum, and evaluate whether it influences reproductive patterns. All 33 colonies of the study population were infected, suggesting that Wolbachia infection is at, or close to, fixation. Interestingly, in colonies with fewer infected workers, significantly more sexuals are produced, indicating that Wolbachia has deleterious effects in this species. In addition, adult workers are shown to have significantly lower infection rates (45%) than worker pupae (87%) or virgin queens (94%), suggesting that workers lose their infection over life. Clearance of Wolbachia infection has, to our knowledge, never been shown in any other natural system, but we argue that it may, in this case, represent an adaptive strategy to reduce colony load. The cause of fixation requires further study, but our data strongly suggest that Wolbachia has no influence on the sex ratio in this species.

   users who share injection equipment
AB Designing studies to examine hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission via the shared use of drug injection paraphernalia other than syringes is difficult because of saturation levels of HCV infection in most samples of injection drug users (IDUs). The authors measured the incidence of HCV infection in a large cohort of young IDUs from Chicago, Illinois, and determined the risk of HCV seroconversion associated with specific forms of sharing injection paraphernalia. From 1997 to 1999, serum samples obtained from 702 IDUs aged 18-30 years were screened for HCV antibodies; prevalence was 27%. Seronegative participants were tested for HCV antibodies at baseline, at 6 months, and at 12 months. During 290 person-years of follow-up, 29 participants seroconverted (incidence: 10.0/100 person-years). The adjusted relative hazard of seroconversion, controlling for demographic and drug-use covariates, was highest for sharing "cookers" (relative hazard = 4.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.4, 11.8), followed by sharing cotton filters (relative hazard = 2.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 5.0). Risks associated with syringe-sharing and sharing of rinse water were elevated but not significant. After adjustment for syringe-sharing, sharing cookers remained the strongest predictor of seroconversion (relative hazard = 3.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.3, 9.9). The authors conclude that sharing of injection equipment other than syringes may be an important cause of HCV transmission between IDUs.

TI Signaling health versus parasites
AB The Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis, that parasite-host coevolution can maintain heritable variation in fitness, has inspired a very successful research program on sexual selection on signals of health. The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis was developed to provide a handicapping mechanism to stabilize the correlation between signals and health. In earlier articles, I showed that handicap signaling is a special case, not a general law that we can rely on to deduce relative costs across signalers of different quality at equilibrium. The essential requirement for reliable signaling is that higher-quality signalers are more efficient; they get greater marginal fitness returns from an incremental increase in the signal. This does not undermine the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis or the immunocompetence mechanism, but it does raise doubts about a widespread assumption that is commonly used to test these hypotheses: that sexual selection on signals of health implies the choice of mates with the fewest parasites. Immunity and parasites might play a fundamental role in many biological signaling systems, but viability-indicating traits are not necessarily parasite-load-indicating traits. Theory allows for the possibility that high-quality big signalers have greater health and more parasites than low-quality small signalers (and the data suggest that in many systems they do). This means that we cannot test the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis or the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis by counting parasites. More generally, we cannot understand sexual selection on signals of health by focusing on the viability costs of signals.

TI Transmission patterns of natural and recombinant baculoviruses
AB The advent of genetically modified organisms such as pathogens has raised ecological questions that need to be addressed in order to assess any risks involved in their use, The baculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV), which infects a number of lepidopteran species, has been modified to express an insect-selective toxin, This genetic modification increases the speed with which it kills its host. However, in addition to this intended feature of the modified virus, there may be other consequences for the host-pathogen interaction. We report a field experiment in which transmission patterns of the wild-type and the genetically modified baculovirus are measured within and between a model target (susceptible) and nontarget (less susceptible) lepidopteran species. Two foliar feeders were chosen: Trichoplusia ni, the cabbage looper, is highly susceptible to this pathogen, while Mamestra brassicae, the cabbage moth, is semipermissive. These two species are used as both the source and the recipients of infection for both virus types. A series of models are fitted to determine the probabilities of infection (given survival from other sources of mortality) over a 7-d period within contained field cages. Fitting these models to data illustrates teat a substantial fraction of the population escapes infection, and it is the size of the pathogen-free refuge that varies between treatments. When infected individuals from the less susceptible species die, the yield of virus is greater than from susceptible hosts, yet this does not significantly alter the risk of transmission to other hosts. In contrast, the genetically modified baculovirus always results in a lower risk of infection in the field compared to the wild type. This is because the recombinant virus causes paralysis, and as a result, the cadaver may fall from the plant before death and virus release. Hence the number of cadavers remaining on the foliage has a greater influence on transmission than the yield of virus from those cadavers.

TI Time-delayed effects of climate variation on host-parasite dynamics
AB Parasites are ubiquitous, but widely neglected, components of food webs. Because of their trophic position, parasites may have major direct and indirect effects on community structure. Because the magnitude of these effects is likely to depend on parasite density, this study was undertaken to explore temporal patterns in the density of parasites and the processes responsible for those patterns. Parasitism by Howardula nematodes was monitored in four species of mycophagous Drosophila (D. falleni, D. neotestacea, D. putrida, and D. recens) that were sampled monthly from 1984 through 1998 near Rochester, New York, USA. Adult flies were collected by sweep netting over naturally occurring mushrooms or commercial Agaricus bisportis mushrooms that had been set out as baits. These adults were then dissected to determine whether they were parasitized by Howardula nematodes.
   The prevalence of parasitism varied substantially among species, being greatest in D. neotestacea (23.0% infected) and least in D. recens (4.8%). Parasitism was greatest in the spring and fall, and least in midsummer. Prevalence of parasitism covaried significantly through time among the three principal host species, D. falleni, D. neotestacea, and D. putrida, in part because the different species often breed in the same individual mushrooms, the site where nematode transmission from adult flies to larvae occurs. The mean prevalence of parasitism across these three species at the end of the season (September) was significantly correlated with the total precipitation from May through August. The mean prevalence of parasitism in the spring collections was significantly correlated with the mean prevalence the previous fall, because flies overwinter as adults. Consequently, the mean prevalence of parasitism in spring was highly correlated with May through August precipitation the previous year. It is hypothesized that rainfall, which stimulates the production of mushrooms (the flies' breeding sites), interacts with density-dependent nematode transmission to influence the prevalence of parasitism in these populations.

TI Larval competition affects the life histories and dispersal behavior of
   an avian ectoparasite
AB Dispersal has profound effects on parasite populations. Understanding the dispersal behavior of parasites is fundamental to our appreciation of their virulence, epidemiology, and host specificity. Very few host-parasite systems, however, allow for studying how parasites optimize their transmission rates. Here, we investigated the dispersal behavior of a common ectoparasite of European passerine birds, the flea Ceratophyllus gallinae. This flea primarily infests hole-nesting species and breeds during its host's breeding season. Once the host leaves the nest, flea larvae build cocoons, pupate, and remain dormant before initiating their host search. There is considerable variation in the time at which they hatch and disperse from the nest boxes. Some offspring disperse before the hosts choose their nest sites at the beginning of the next breeding period, while others wait until after that stage to disperse. By experimentally manipulating the density of fleas in the nests of their breeding hosts we were able to investigate density-dependent processes that would later affect the dispersal behavior of flea offspring. We found that the density of offspring in the nests was negatively correlated with the proportion of early-dispersing individuals and negatively affected the phenotypic quality of dispersers. Flea offspring of poor phenotypic quality in terms of body size dispersed earlier and had lower potential fecundity than bigger individuals. In a laboratory experiment, we found that the intensity of larval competition strongly affected offspring development, body size at maturity, and overwintering capacity. Thus, in order to maximize their chance of transmission, C. gallinae individuals adjust their dispersal behavior according to their phenotypic quality. In this species, dispersal in time may be explained by the carryover effects of variation in the amount of competition experienced at the larval stage.

TI Antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance: A population perspective
AB The need to stem the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has prompted multiple, sometimes conflicting, calls for changes in the use of antimicrobial agents. One source of disagreement concerns the major mechanisms by which antibiotics select resistant strains. For infections like tuberculosis, in which resistance can emerge in treated hosts through mutation, prevention of antimicrobial resistance in individual hosts is a primary method of preventing the spread of resistant organisms in the community. By contrast, for many other important resistant pathogens, such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium resistance is mediated by the acquisition of genes or gene fragments by horizontal transfer; resistance in the treated host is a relatively rare event. For these organisms, indirect, population-level mechanisms of selection account for the increase in the prevalence of resistance. These mechanisms can operate even when treatment has a modest, or even negative, effect on an individual host's colonization with resistant organisms.

One (0.2%) male, and 2 (0.4%) female STD patients were infected with both HIV-1 and HIV-2. It was concluded that the prevalence of HIV-1 infection varied from 0.4% among urban residents to 25.3-41.3% among STD attendees. There is a low prevalence of HIV-2 present in Ethiopian subjects. Risky sexual behaviour is significantly associated with HIV-infection in Ethiopia.

TI Vaccination against hepatitis B in low endemic countries
AB A mathematical model that takes transmission by sexual contact and vertical transmission into account was employed to describe the transmission dynamics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and vaccination against it. The model is an extension of a model by Williams et al. (Epidemiol Infect 1996; 116; 71-89) in that it takes immigration of hepatitis B carriers from countries with higher prevalence into account. Model parameters were estimated from data from The Netherlands where available. The main results were that, given the estimates for the parameters describing sexual behaviour in The Netherlands, the basic reproduction number R,, is smaller than I in the heterosexual population. As a consequence, the immigration of carriers into the population largely determines the prevalence of HBV carriage and therefore limits the possible success of universal vaccination. Taking into account the prevalence of hepatitis B carriage among immigrants and an age-dependent probability of becoming a carrier after infection, we estimate that a fraction of between 5 and 10% of carrier states could be prevented by universal vaccination.

TI Transmission patterns of African horse sickness and equine encephalosis
   viruses in South African donkeys
AB African horse sickness (AHS) and equine encephalosis (EE) viruses are endemic to southern Africa. AHS virus causes severe epidemics when introduced to naive equine Populations, resulting in severe restrictions on the movement of equines between AHS-positive and negative countries. Recent zoning of South Africa has created an AHS-free zone to facilitate equine movement, but the transmission dynamics of these viruses are not fully understood. Here, we present further analyses of serosurveys of donkeys in South Africa conducted in 1983-5 and in 1993-5. Age-prevalence data are used to derive estimates of the force of infection, lambda. For both viruses, lambda was highest in the northeastern part of the country and declined towards the southwest. In most of the country, EE virus had a higher transmission rate than AHS. The force of infection increased for EE virus between 1985 and 1993, but decreased for AHS virus. Both viruses showed high levels of variation in transmission between districts within the same province, particularly in areas of intermediate transmission. These data emphasize the focal nature of these viruses, and indicate areas where further data will assist ill understanding the geographical variation in transmission.

TI Regulation of CC chemokine receptor 5 and CD4 expression and human
   immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in human macrophages and
   microglia by T helper type 2 cytokines
AB Macrophages, microglia, and other mononuclear phagocytes serve as cellular reservoirs for viral persistence In patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. To understand host mechanisms that affect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis by modulating expression of coreceptors, cytokine regulation of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CD4 expression on monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), and microglia was investigated. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 enhanced the entry and replication of HIV-1 in microglia through up-regulation of CD4 and CCR5 expression, respectively. IL-4 stimulated HIV-1 replication in MDMs but down-regulated CD4 and CCR5 expression and inhibited virus entry, whereas IL-10 had the opposite effects. Thus, mechanisms independent of CCR5 and CD4 expression levels are involved in pathways that regulate HIV-1 replication in MDMs. CCR5 up-regulation by IL-10 was associated with increased migration of microglia in response to macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta. These findings suggest that increased production of T helper type 2 cytokines In the later stages of disease can enhance virus entry and replication in mononuclear phagocytes and facilitate chemotactic migration.

TI Parasite-mediated competition among red-legged partridges and other
   lowland gamebirds
AB Evidence suggests that the transmission of shared parasites from ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), specifically the caecal nematode Heterakis gallinarum, may be I cause of the decline of the gray partridge (Perdix perdix) in the United Kingdom (UK) over the past 50 years. It may also be a factor preventing the recovery of the remaining wild gray partridge populations. Trials were undertaken to investigate whether the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is involved in (his interaction, by exposing individuals of all 3 host species to infection on 7 gamebird estates. The low rate of parasite establishment in the red-legged partridge demonstrated that, as with the gray partridge, the parasite cannot persist in this host species. The lack of a relationship between H. gallinarum intensity and red-legged partridge condition indicated that, as with the ring-necked pheasant, the parasite does not seriously affect this host species. Hence, red-legged partridges play little or no role in the interaction mediated via H. gallinarum that occurs among UK lowland gamebirds, since they are unlikely to be either another source of deleterious infection to the gray partridge or adversely affected by the transmission of H. gallinarum from ring-necked pheasants. Ring-necked pheasants are thus implicated as being solely responsible for maintaining infections of H. gallinarum in other lowland gamebirds in the UK and any associated effects.

TI Sanctions and mutualism stability: why do rhizobia fix nitrogen?
AB Why do rhizobia expend resources on fixing N-2 for the benefit of their host plant, when they could use those resources for their own reproduction? We present a series of theoretical models which counter the hypotheses that N-2 fixation is favoured because it (i) increases the exudation of useful resources to related rhizobia in the nearby soil, or (ii) increases plant growth and therefore the resources available for rhizobia growth. Instead, we suggest that appreciable levels of N-2 fixation are only favoured when plants preferentially supply more resources to (or are less likely to senesce) nodules that are fixing more N2 (termed plant sanctions). The implications for different agricultural practices and mutualism stability in general are discussed.

TI Host range and local parasite adaptation
AB Parasites may be expected to become locally adapted to their hosts. However, while many empirical studies have demonstrated local parasite adaptation, others have failed to demonstrate it, or have shown local parasite maladaptation. Researchers have suggested that gene flow can swamp local parasite-host dynamics and produce local adaptation only at certain geographical scales; others have argued that evolutionary lags can account for both null and maladaptive results. In this paper, we use item response theory (IRT) to test whether host range influences the likelihood of parasites locally adapting to their hosts. We collated 32 independent experiments testing for local adaptation, where parasites could be assigned as having either broad or narrow host ranges (BHR and NHR, respectively). Twenty-five tests based on BHR parasites had a significantly lower average effect size than seven NHR tests, indicating that studies based on BHR parasites are less likely to demonstrate local parasite adaptation. We argue that this may relate to evolutionary lags during diffuse coevolution of BHR parasites with their hosts, rather than differences in experimental approaches or other confounds between BHR and NHR studies.

TI Immune protection against staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced toxic shock
   by vaccination with a Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon
AB A candidate vaccine against staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) was developed using a Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus vector. This vaccine is composed of a self-replicating RNA, termed "replicon," containing the VEE nonstructural genes and cis-acting elements and a gene encoding mutagenized SEB (mSEB). Cotransfection of baby hamster kidney cells with the mSEB replicon and 2 helper RNA molecules resulted in the release of propagation-deficient mSEB-VEE replicon particles (mSEB-VRPs). Mice inoculated subcutaneously with mSEB-VRPs were protected (15 of 20 mice) from a challenge with 5 median lethal dose units of wildtype (wt) SEB. T cells from mice vaccinated with mSEB-VRP responded normally both in vitro to wt SEB and in recall response to the inactivated mSEB polypeptide. The profile of cytokines measured after challenge with wt SEB suggested that the mode of protection was predominantly Th1 dependent. Our results suggest that the VEE replicon is a practical and convenient model system for evaluating efficacy of vaccines for the control of bacterial diseases.

TI Clone mixtures and a pacemaker: new facets of Red-Queen theory and
   ecology
AB Host-parasite antagonistic interaction has been proposed as a potential agent to promote genetic polymorphism and to favour sex against asex, despite its twofold cost in reproduction. However, the host-parasite gene-for-gene dynamics often produce unstable cycles that tend to destroy genetic diversity. Here, we examine such diversity destroying coevolutionary dynamics of host and parasite, which is coupled through local or global migration, or both, between demes in a metapopulation structure. We show that, with global migration in the island model, peculiar out-of-phase islands spontaneously arise in the cluster of islands converging to a global synchrony. Such asynchrony induced by the 'pacemaker islands' serves to restore genetic variation. With increasing fraction of local migration, spots of asynchrony are converted into loci or foci of spiral and target patterns, whose rotating arms then cover the majority of demes. A multi-locus analogue of the model reproduces the same tendency toward asynchrony, and the condition arises for an advantage of asexual clones over their sexual counterpart when enough genetic diversity is maintained through metapopulation storage-migration serves as a cheap alternative to sex.

TI Effects of acquired immunity and mating strategy on the genetic
   structure of parasite populations
AB Although it may have profound effects on how researchers seek to tackle many infectious diseases, little is known of the genetic structure of many pathogen populations. Previous models have suggested that if levels of cross-protection are high, parasite populations may be structured into discrete strains with nonoverlapping antigenic repertoires, even among populations that reproduce sexually. Here, I consider a discrete model of the coevolution of parasites with host-acquired immunity. In this model, if the effective recombination rate is low, strain structure can be maintained for very high levels of cross-protection. However, if the effective recombination rate is higher, this strain structure can no longer be maintained. The effective recombination rate is affected by the actual recombination rate between immunologically selected loci, the proportion of individuals that reproduce sexually, whether recombination occurs inside or outside of the host or vector, and the level of cross-protection. The model predicts that for Plasmodium falciparum, where reproduction occurs inside of a vector, we expect to see strain structure in areas of low transmission but not in areas of high transmission. Strain structure is unlikely to be seen in parasites that reproduce outside of a host or vector, such as Strongyloides ratti.

TI Resistance and tolerance in a host plant-holoparasitic plant
   interaction: Genetic variation and costs
AB Host organisms are believed to evolve defense mechanisms (i.e., resistance and/or tolerance) under selective pressures exerted by natural enemies. A prerequisite for the evolution of resistance and tolerance is the existence of genetic variation in these traits for natural selection to act. However, selection for resistance and/or tolerance may be constrained by negative genetic correlations with other traits that affect host fitness. We studied genetic variation in resistance and tolerance against parasitic infection and the potential fitness costs associated with these traits using a novel study system, namely the interaction between a flowering plant and a parasitic plant. In this system, parasitic infection has significant negative effects on host growth and reproduction and may thus act as a selective agent. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we grew host plants, Urtica dioica, that originated from a single natural population and represented 20 maternal families either uninfected or infected with the holoparasitic dodder, Cuscuta europaea, that originated from the same site. We calculated correlations among resistance, tolerance, and host performance to test for costs of resistance and tolerance. We measured resistance as parasite performance (quantitative resistance) and tolerance as the slopes of regressions relating the vegetative and reproductive biomass of host plants to damage level (measured as parasite biomass). We observed significant differences among host families in parasite resistance and in parasite tolerance in terms of reproductive biomass, a result that suggests genetic variation in these traits. Furthermore, we found differences in resistance and tolerance between female and male host plants. In addition, the correlations indicate costs of resistance in terms of host growth and reproduction and costs of tolerance in terms of host reproduction. Our results thus indicate that host tolerance and resistance can evolve as a response to infection by a parasitic plant and that costs of resistance and tolerance may be one factor maintaining genetic variation in these traits.

TI Can vertebrate predation alter aggregation of risk in an insect
   host-parasitoid system?
AB 1. Insect host-parasite systems allow investigations of the trophodynamics of ecological communities within a well-formed theoretical context. A little explored feature of such systems involves the interplay between generalized consumers and host-parasitoid dynamics. I report a study investigating how the impacts of generalized consumers, viewed here as interaction modifications, may influence the stability of a particular interspecific interaction.
   2. In a study involving overwintering oothecae of the praying mantis Stagmomantis limbata (Hahn), birds damaged 36% of oothecae, 85% of which had also been parasitized by winter-active, multivoltine torymid wasps of the genus Podagrion. Birds preferentially preyed upon oothecae oviposited high on trees, but such predation was often incomplete, leaving both viable and parasitized mantid eggs inside damaged oothecae.
   3. Two factors allowed bird damage to influence the distribution of risk of parasitism among oothecae and among hosts. These were (1) that some parasites - but no mantids - emerged successfully prior to bird predation and (2) that extensive post-damage foraging by parasitoids occurred, but that the nature of this foraging was altered little by oothecal damage.
   4. In all, bird damage engendered a fourfold increase (from 1.5 to 6.5) in the CV2 of parasitism risk among hosts (a stability criterion that has been proposed for host-parasitoid interactions) and increased the relative importance of host-density-dependent parasitism. The role of timing of the two natural enemy impacts for stability of the host-parasitoid interaction is discussed.

TI Local adaptation, evolutionary potential and host-parasite coevolution:
   interactions between migration, mutation, population size and generation
   time
AB Local adaptation of parasites to their sympatric hosts has been investigated on different biological systems through reciprocal transplant experiments. Most of these studies revealed a local adaptation of the parasite. In several cases, however, parasites were found to be locally maladapted or neither adapted nor maladapted. In the present paper, we try to determine the causes of such variability in these results. We analyse a host-parasite metapopulation model and study the effect of several factors on the emergence of local adaptation: population sizes, mutation rates and migration rates for both the host and the parasite, and parasite generation time. We show that all these factors may act on local adaptation through their effects on the evolutionary potential of each species. In particular, we find that higher numbers of mutants or migrants do, in general, promote local adaptation. Interestingly, shorter parasite generation time does not always favour parasite local adaptation. When genetic variability is limiting, shorter generation time, via an increase of the strength of selection, decreases the capacity of the parasite to adapt to an evolving host.

TI Temporal change in mite abundance and its effect on barn swallow
   reproduction and sexual selection
AB The tropical fowl mite Ornithonyssus bursa parasitizing barn swallows Hirundo rustica in a Danish population demonstrated a dramatic change in abundance during 1982-2000. Prevalence of mites in nests showed a decrease from 66% in 1987 to a minimum of 1% in 1999. Two parasite manipulation experiments of barn swallow nests in 1988 and 1999 revealed a strong effect of parasites on host reproductive success in the first year (with an average reduction in seasonal reproductive success of 30% when 50 mites were added to nests as compared with controls), but only a weak effect the last year. This pattern was paralleled by a positive relationship between reduction in host reproductive success between egg laying and fledging and mite prevalence during different years of the study period. Mite abundance on adult hosts was negatively related to tail length of males (a secondary sexual character) at the peak of mite abundance in 1988, while that relationship became weaker in the beginning of the 1990s and disappeared at the end of the 1990s. Assortative mating with respect to mite loads in the 1980s also disappeared in the 1990s. Mean tail length of male hosts increased by 1.3 standard deviations during the study period because of changes in phenotype-dependent patterns of mortality outside the breeding season. This microevolutionary change in mean male phenotype of the host was accompanied by a correlated response in mite abundance. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the host has become more resistant to the mite during the study period, and that the mite from earlier playing an important role in natural and sexual selection of the host now is of little importance.

   Africa
AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease in the world. The WHO estimates that 3% (170 million) of the world's population are chronically infected with HCV. Sub-Saharan Africa is of great interest because it is reported to have the highest HCV prevalence rate (5.3%), and a concurrent HIV epidemic. In our review of the published literature we found consistent evidence of high HCV prevalence in many countries of Africa. We estimate the overall prevalence of HCV in Sub-Saharan Africa is 3.0%. The central African region has the highest estimated prevalence of 6%, west Africa has an estimated prevalence of 2.4%, and southern and east Africa with the lowest estimated prevalence of 1.6%. Given low sexual transmission of HCV and infrequency of intravenous drug use in Sub-Saharan Africa, iatrogenic causes of HCV transmission need to be further evaluated.

TI Diversification and host switching in avian malaria parasites
AB The switching of parasitic organisms to novel hosts, in which they may cause the emergence of new diseases, is of great concern to human health and the management of wild and domesticated populations of animals. We used a phylogenetic approach to develop a better statistical assessment of host switching in a large sample of vector-borne malaria parasites of birds (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) over their history of parasite-host relations. Even with sparse sampling, the number of parasite lineages was almost equal to the number of avian hosts. We found that strongly supported sister lineages of parasites, averaging 1.2% sequence divergence, exhibited highly significant host and geographical fidelity. Event-based matching of host and parasite phylogenetic trees revealed significant cospeciation. However, the accumulated effects of host switching and long distance dispersal cause these signals to disappear before 4% sequence divergence is achieved. Mitochondrial DNA nucleotide substitution appears to occur about three times faster in hosts than in parasites, contrary to findings on other parasite-host systems. Using this mutual calibration the phylogenies of the parasites and their hosts appear to be similar in age, suggesting that avian malaria parasites diversified along with their modern avian hosts. Although host switching has been a prominent feature over the evolutionary history of avian malaria parasites, it is infrequent and unpredictable on time scales germane to public health and wildlife management.

TI Antagonistic coevolution between a bacterium and a bacteriophage
AB Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites is believed to play a pivotal role in host and parasite population dynamics, the evolutionary maintenance of sex and the evolution of parasite virulence. Furthermore, antagonistic coevolution is believed to be responsible for rapid differentiation of both hosts and parasites between geographically structured populations. Yet empirical evidence for host-parasite antagonistic coevolution, and its impact on between-population genetic divergence, is limited. Here we demonstrate a long-term arms race between the infectivity of a viral parasite (bacteriophage; phage) and the resistance of its bacterial host. Coevolution was largely driven by directional selection, with hosts becoming resistant to a wider range of parasite genotypes and parasites infective to a wider range of host genotypes. Coevolution followed divergent trajectories between replicate communities despite establishment with isogenic bacteria and phage, and resulted in bacteria adapted to their own, compared with other, phage populations.

AB To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of gene therapy for treating human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, a novel simian virus (SV) 40-derived vector gene delivery system that efficiently transduces human leukocytes was combined with a model using severe combined immunodeficiency mice infected with HIV-1 and implanted with human fetal thymic and liver tissue (thy/liv-SCID-hu mice). The SV40-derived vector, SV(Aw), which encodes a variable fragment antibody recognizing HIV-1 integrase (IN#33), was injected into the human thymic grafts of thy/liv-SCID-hu mice and induced IN#33 expression in most of the thymocytes in the graft. After in vivo challenge with HIV-1, IN#33 expression inhibited in vivo HIV-1 infection, as evidenced by the markedly lower number of HIV-1-infected thymocytes detected in human thymic grafts injected with the SV(Aw) vector, compared with those injected with a control SV40-derived vector. Thus, these findings demonstrate the utility of this new mouse model system for assessing the in vivo efficacy of HIV-1-specific gene therapy. In addition, these data indicate that SV40-derived vectors may provide a system capable of efficient in vivo gene delivery.

AB The innate immune system represents the initial arm of host defense against pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Neutrophils, monocytes, and tissue-based macrophages are major cellular components of this system. The potential ability to augment activity of the innate immune system has increased dramatically during the past 2 decades, with the discovery and development of cytokines. Four cytokines, namely granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and interferon (IFN)-gamma, have received increasing attention as potential adjunctive agents for the treatment of infectious diseases. In various animal models of infection, therapeutic administration of each of the 4 cytokines has been shown to enhance pathogen eradication and to decrease morbidity and/or mortality. However, variable therapeutic efficacy has been reported in clinical trials conducted to date. This review summarizes the current status of the use of G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and IFN-gamma in the treatment of infectious diseases.

TI Treatment of hepatitis C and anemia in human immunodeficiency
   virus-infected patients
AB Because of shared modes of transmission, co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common. Co-infection with HIV increases HCV virus load, liver-related mortality, and the risk of sexual and perinatal transmission of HCV, and it may accelerate HCV disease progression. With combination interferon (IFN)-alpha2b/ribavirin or pegylated IFN-alpha2b/ribavirin therapy, long-term remission is possible for HCV-infected patients. Preliminary evidence suggests that the combination of IFN-alpha2b/ribavirin can achieve similar response rates in HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals with no adverse effect on HIV RNA concentrations. Although adverse effects are more frequent with combination therapy than with IFN-alpha monotherapy, most are manageable. In addition, few instances of drug-drug antagonism have been reported among drugs used to treat each disease, although further study is necessary. Ribavirin-associated hemolytic anemia is a potential problem in a patient population that is already susceptible to anemia but is manageable with recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa).

TI Early maternal effects mediated by immunity depend on sexual
   ornamentation of the male partner
AB Vertebrates have an immature immune system soon after birth, and parasites can therefore be particularly virulent to young hosts. Transfer of immune factors via the egg can give rise to early maternal effects with important consequences for offspring fitness, as maternally derived immunity confers anti-parasite protection. Mothers are expected to allocate immunity differentially to the eggs according to the reproductive value of their offspring as influenced by the quality of their father. In this study, we analysed transmission to the yolk of antibodies specific to an antigen (Newcastle disease virus vaccine, NDV) by vaccinated female barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) mated to males whose secondary sexual characteristics had been manipulated. Concentration of anti-NDV antibodies in the yolk positively covaried with that in maternal plasma. Anti-NDV antibodies were more concentrated in the first but not the fourth eggs laid by females mated with tail-elongated males compared with those mated with tail-shortened and control males. This experiment shows that allocation of maternal immune factors to the eggs is affected by quality of the male, as signalled by its secondary sexual characteristic. Thus, early maternal effects are influenced by sexual attractiveness of male mates and are mediated by immunity.

TI Immune system evolution among anthropoid primates: parasites, injuries
   and predators
AB In this study we investigate whether present-day variation in a key component of the immune system (baseline leucocyte concentrations) represents evolutionary adaptation to ecological factors. In particular, we test three hypotheses, namely that leucocyte concentrations will be positively related to one of the following: risk of disease transmission between hosts, which is related to host abundance (hypothesis 1), risk of disease infection from the environment due to parasite viability and abundance (hypothesis 2), and risk of injury and subsequent infection, for example following attacks by predators (hypothesis 3). No support was found for hypothesis 1: neither population density nor group size were associated with variation in leucocyte concentrations. Hypothesis 2 was supported: for both sexes, lymphocyte and phagocyte concentrations were positively correlated with annual rainfall, as predicted if interspecific variation in the immune system is related to parasite prevalence (primates suffer higher rates of parasitism in wetter habitats). Support was also provided for hypothesis 3: for both males and females, platelet concentrations were negatively related to body mass, as predicted if injury risk affects immune system evolution, because animals with larger body mass have a relatively lower surface area available to injury. Additional support was provided for hypothesis 3 by the finding that for males, the sex which plays the active role in troop defence and retaliation against predators, concentration of platelets was positively correlated with rate of predation. In conclusion, our analysis suggests that the risk of disease infection from the environment and the risk of injury have played a key role in immune system evolution among anthropoid primates.

Sixteen of the 40 children included in the final analysis were confirmed to have La Crosse infection by a fourfold increase in antibody titers between collection of acute- and convalescent-phase sera. Factors significantly associated with La Crosse infection included average number of hours per day spent outdoors (5.9 for La Crosse virus cases vs. 4.0 for noncases, p = 0.049); living in a residence with one or more tree holes within 100 m (relative risk = 3.96 vs. no tree holes within 100 m, p = 0.028); and total burden of Aedes albopictus (number of female and male larvae and adults collected at a site), which was more than three times greater around the residences of La Crosse virus cases versus noncases (p = 0.013). Evidence is accumulating that the newly introduced mosquito species Ae. albopictus may be involved in the emergence of La Crosse virus infection in eastern Tennessee.

AB Formula feeding is an alternative method to prevent mother-to-child infection with human immunodeficiency virus through breast-feeding in developing countries. Growth of bacterial pathogens in reconstituted infant formula has become a health hazard when contaminated water is used for rehydration. This study was conducted to assess bacterial safety risk of using contaminated water to reconstitute infant formula. Survival and growth characteristics were determined for three bacterial pathogens, Vibrio cholerae O1, Shigella flexneri, and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, inoculated into sterile tap water (3.2-3.4 log(10) colony-forming units [CFU]/ml) and infant formula (1.5-1.7 and 3.2-3.4 log(10) CFU/ml) and incubated at 4degreesC or 30degreesC for up to 24 hours. Vibrio cholerae O1 was the most sensitive of the three pathogens when inoculated into water, with no viable cells detected within 2 hours at 4degreesC or 30degreesC. The rate of inactivation in water was greater at 30degreesC than at 4degreesC. Vibrio cholerae O1, Shigella flexneri, and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis grew rapidly in infant formula at 30degreesC, reaching populations of 9.2, 8.7, and 9.2 log(10) CFU/ml, respectively, at 24 hours. Populations of all three pathogens did not change significantly after incubating infant formula for 24 hours at 4degreesC, but continuously decreased in water throughout incubation for 24 hours, regardless of temperature. Results suggest that unless refrigerated, reconstituted infant formula should be consumed soon after preparation to avoid increased risk of illness associated with increases in populations of pathogenic bacteria that may be introduced by contaminated water.

Participation included 77 households in three communities lacking adequate municipal water and sewage services. The household was the unit of analysis and sampling was from household biosolid waste from newly installed composting toilets. The proportion of households positive for Giardia and Cryptosporidium was high, 82% and 70%, respectively, and this was in contrast to the few households (14%) reporting at least one individual with diarrhea symptoms. This finding indicated that most of the participant families were chronically infected but asymptomatic. In the multivariate analysis, there was a statistically significant protective effect for Cryptosporidium in those households that purified drinking water but not for Giardia. Those households with children less than five years of age were 1.3 times at risk for Giardia infection. Our findings highlighted differences in the transmission mode of these two pathogens and underscore the need for interventions addressing hygienc, water supply, and sanitation.

We show that, under many conditions, such sterilizing pathogens evolve high rather than intermediate levels of virulence, and this pushes the pathogen population and sometimes the host population toward extinction. We also show that spatial population structure can reverse this evolutionary result and allow the persistence of intermediate-virulence pathogens. Thus, spatial population structure may be vital to the persistence of sterilizing pathogens in nature.

TI The evolution of parasite virulence, superinfection, and host resistance
AB We analyze the evolutionary consequences of host resistance (the ability to decrease the probability of being infected by parasites) for the evolution of parasite virulence (the deleterious effect of a parasite on its host). When only single infections occur, host resistance does not affect the evolution of parasite virulence. However, when superinfections occur, resistance tends to decrease the evolutionarily stable (ES) level of parasite virulence. We first study a simple model in which the host does not coevolve with the parasite (i.e., the frequency of resistant hosts is independent of the parasite). We show that a higher proportion of resistant host decreases the ES level of parasite virulence. Higher levels of the efficiency of host resistance, however, do not always decrease the ES parasite virulence. The implications of these results for virulence management (evolutionary consequences of public health policies) are discussed. Second, we analyze the case where host resistance is allowed to coevolve with parasite virulence using the classical gene-for-gene (GFG) model of host-parasite interaction. It is shown that GFG coevolution leads to lower parasite virulence (in comparison with a fully susceptible host population). The model clarifies and relates the different components of the cost of parasitism: infectivity (ability to infect the host) and virulence (deleterious effect) in an evolutionary perspective.

TI Parasite-driven extinction in spatially explicit host-parasite systems
AB General host-parasite theory suggests that parasites may be implicated in the extinction of their hosts by causing instability that leads to increased risk of stochastic extinction. In contrast, spatially explicit models suggest that the parasite may directly drive the host population to extinction. Here we examine the ecological characteristics of host-parasite interactions that favor parasite-driven host extinction. Pair approximations and simulations show that parasites only drive their hosts to extinction when they significantly reduce host reproduction. As a matter of interest, parasites that have a relatively small effect on host death rate are more likely to cause host extinction. Parasite-driven host extinction occurs at any population size, whereas extinction caused by stochastic effects is less likely to occur in large host populations. Populations may therefore be under threat from parasites that stop host reproduction, and this type of parasite may prove to be the most effective biological pesticide.

TI Good medicine for conservation biology: The intersection of epidemiology
   and conservation theory
AB Infectious disease can be a concern for several aspects of conservation biology, such as determining threats to species, estimating population viability, and designing reserves, captive breeding, and recovery programs. Several measures are useful for describing infectious diseases in host populations, but it is not straightforward to determine the degree to which a particular disease may affect a host population. The most basic epidemiological theory suggests that populations should be least subject to host-specific infectious disease when they are at low abundance ( paradoxically, the state at which they are in most need of conservation action). There are important exceptions, however, such as when a reservoir host exists or when Allee or stochastic effects occur. Several of the key threats to biodiversity-habitat alteration, introduced species, pollution, resource exploitation, and climate change-can facilitate and/or impair transmission of infectious disease. Common management tools such as population viability analysis rarely address infectious disease explicitly. We suggest that such an inclusion is both possible and warranted. Considerations of infectious disease may influence the way we determine whether a species is in need of protection and how we might design reserves and captive breeding programs. Examples from the literature suggest that (1) introduced pathogens can make abundant species rare and (2) diseases of domestic animals can dramatically affect rare species. For both scenarios, conditions that cause stress or reduce genetic variation may increase susceptibility to disease, whereas crowding and cross-species contact can increase transmission. Southern sea otters ( Enhydra lutris nereis ) make an interesting case study for consideration of the intersection of epidemiology and conservation because disease may be an important factor limiting the growth of otter populations. We conclude that pathogens are of increasing concern for conservation. Because many newly emerging pathogen dynamics often do not conform to the simplifying assumptions used in classic epidemiology, a detailed understanding of pathogen life history will illuminate the intersection of epidemiology and conservation theory.

TI Effects of grassland plant species diversity, abundance, and composition
   on foliar fungal disease
AB In an experiment that directly. manipulated grassland plant species richness and composition, decreased plant species richness ("diversity") increased pathogen load (the percentage of leaf area infected by species-specific foliar pathogens across the plant community) in 1998. Pathogen load was almost three times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot planted with 24 grassland plant species, an approximately natural diversity. Eleven individual diseases increased in severity (percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease) at lower plant species richness, and severity of only one disease was positively correlated with diversity. For 10 of the 11 diseases whose severity was negatively related to diversity, disease severity was positively correlated with host abundance, and in six of these cases, species diversity had no effect on disease severity after controlling for the effects of host abundance. These results suggest that increased abundances of individual host species at lower species diversity increased disease transmission and severity. In 1996 and 1997, similar results for a smaller number of diseases sampled were found in this experiment and another similar one. Although the effect of diversity on disease was highly significant, considerable variance in pathogen load remained among plots of a given diversity level. Much of this residual variance was explained by community characteristics that were a function of the species composition of the communities (the identity of species present vs. those lost). Specifically, communities that lost less disease-prone species had higher pathogen loads; this effect explained more variance in pathogen load than did diversity. Also, communities that lost the species dominant at high diversity had higher pathogen loads, presumably because relaxed competition allowed greater increases in host abundances, but this effect was weak. Among plant species, disease proneness appeared to be determined more by regional than local processes, because it was better correlated with frequency of the plant species' populations across the region than with local abundance or frequency across the state. In total, our results support the hypothesis that decreased species diversity will increase foliar pathogen load if this increases host abundance and, therefore, disease transmission. Additionally, changes in community characteristics determined by species composition will strongly influence pathogen load.

TI Global perspectives in breast milk contamination: Infectious and toxic
   hazards
AB Breast milk is the natural and optimal food for infants. In addition to meeting nutritional needs, breast milk provides numerous immunologic, developmental, psychologic, economic, and practical advantages. It is postulated that breast-feeding may also be related to the prevention of some adult health problems such as diabetes and coronary heart disease. Malnutrition among infants and young children, which remains one of the most severe global public health problems, is among the main reasons that the World Health Organization (WHO) so strongly supports breast-feeding. However, WHO recognizes the growing concern expressed by scientists, health professionals, environmentalists, and mothers about the potential risks posed by the presence of toxicants and infectious agents in breast milk. In this paper we review the main infectious hazards (tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and human immunodeficiency virus) and selected chemical hazards (tobacco, persistent contaminants) and the activities undertaken by WHO. We conclude that in cases where there is a high degree of pollution from chemical sources occurring simultaneously in a bacterially contaminated environment, the choice is not simply between polluted breast milk and risk-free substitutes. Rather, informed choice is based on assessing the known and unknown risks of artificial feeding versus the unknown, but potential, risks of chemical contamination of breast milk Clearly, die possible toxicity of compounds requires further investigation. Of much greater importance, however, are effective measures to protect the environment for the entire population by controlling the use of these toxic products. Current scientific evidence does not support altering WHO's global public health recommendation of exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months followed by safe and appropriate complementary foods, with continued breast-feeding, up to 2 years of age or beyond.

TI Epidemiology of hepatitis B infection among the Nicobarese - a mongoloid
   tribe of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India
AB Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Union Territory of India, is home to six primitive tribes. Preliminary serological studies carried out earlier among the four accessible tribes revealed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is hyper-endemic among them. The present study was carried out to understand important modes of transmission and to identify possible risk factors associated with HBV infection among the Nicobarese tribe. The epidemiology of HBV infection in these islands appears to be distinct with a high prevalence of the chronic carrier state (22.2%) associated with a comparable proportion of the population being anti-HBs positive (26.3%). More than half of the HBsAg and anti-HBs negative individuals have anti-HBc antibodies. Age, past history of hospital admission, intramuscular injections and number of carriers in the tuhet were found to be significantly associated with exposure to hepatitis B virus. Horizontal transmission through close contact with carriers and perinatal route appears to be an important mode of transmission of HBV in this community. Besides this, use of unsafe injections represents an independent risk factor for acquiring HBV infection in this population. Introducing HBV vaccine in the infant immunization programme and improving injection safety would help to control the infection in the tribal community of these islands.

TI Sexually transmitted disease and the evolution of mating systems
AB Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have been shown to increase the Costs Of multiple mating and therefore favor relatively monogamous mating strategies. We examine another way in which STDs can influence mating systems in species in which female choice is important. Because more popular males are more likely to become infected, STDs can counteract any selective pressure that generates strong mating skews. We build two models to investigate female mate choice when the sexual behavior of females determines the prevalence of infection in the population. The first model has no explicit social structure. The second model considers the spatial distribution of matings under social monogamy, when females mated to unattractive males seek extrapair fertilizations from attractive males. In both cases, the STD has the potential to drastically reduce the mating skew. However, this reduction does not always happen. If the per contact transmission probability is low, the disease dies out and is of no consequence. In contrast, if the transmission probability is very high, males are likely to be infected regardless of their attractiveness, and mating with the most attractive males imposes again no extra cost for the female. We also show that optimal female responses to the risk of STDs can buffer the prevalence of infection to remain constant, or even decrease, with increasing per contact transmission probabilities. In all cases considered, the feedback between mate choice strategies and STD prevalence creates frequency-dependent fitness benefits for the two alternative female phenotypes considered (choosy vs. randomly mating females or faithful vs. unfaithful females). This maintains mixed evolutionarily stable strategies or polymorphisms in female behavior. In this way, a sexually transmitted disease can stabilize the populationwide proportion of females that mate with the most attractive males or that seek extrapair copulations.

TI Population dynamics of the sheep blowfly Lucilia sericata: seasonal
   patterns and implications for control
AB 1. The infestation of sheep with blowfly larvae (sheep strike) is a significant animal welfare and economic problem in many regions of the world. Improved control requires greater knowledge of the population dynamics of the primary agent of strike in temperate areas, the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae).
   2. The abundance of L. sericata was recorded on two farms in south-west England between 1990 and 2000, and the time-series analysed to describe and explain the nature of population change within and between years.
   3. To examine the catch time-series for periodicity, the data were detrended, demeaned and tapered, and plotted against a day-degree time base. Spectral analysis of periodograms showed that the clearest signal present was the low-frequency seasonal cycle. The only other significant signal in both series had a periodicity corresponding to the day-degree requirements for the entire life cycle of this insect species. This suggests that, within each season, the abundance pattern is composed of a series of semi-discrete generation peaks.
   4. Significant density-dependence was detected in the seasonal change in fly abundance and this was shown to be approximately compensatory in action.
   5. The results suggest that populations of L sericata show relatively stable and predictable dynamics, with populations passing through three or four relatively discrete generations each year prior to diapause and limited by strong, apparently compensatory, density-dependence each season.
   6. The results have important implications for the control of this insect parasite. In general, earlier and more intense farmer intervention, to reduce sheep susceptibility and treat struck animals during the blowfly season, would result in a lower L. sericata population and reduced strike incidence. However, at the start of the season, when fly abundance may be lower than the number of susceptible hosts, direct fly control, in addition to treatment, may be a more effective strategy.

TI Correlation of local interleukin-8 with immunoglobulin A against
   Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin and with prolidase and sialidase levels
   in women with bacterial vaginosis
AB Mucosal immune system activation may represent a critical determinant of adverse consequences associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), such as sexual human immunodeficiency virus transmission, upper genital tract infections, postsurgical infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Concentrations of sialidase, prolidase, and anti-Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin (Gvh) immunoglobulin A (IgA) were higher in vaginal fluids of 75 fertile women with BV, compared with concentrations in vaginal fluids of 85 healthy control subjects. Interleukin (IL)-8 levels were positively associated with anti-Gvh IgA response and inversely correlated with high levels of prolidase and sialidase in women with BV. IL-8 concentration was strongly associated with leukocyte count in both healthy and BV-positive women. The absence of leukocytes in most women with BV likely is due to lack of IL-8 induction. Parallel impairment of innate and adaptive mucosal immune factors, likely through microbial hydrolytic effects, may allow for the ascent of microorganisms to the upper genital tract and may facilitate viral infections.

TI Rabies re-examined
AB Rabies is an acute, progressive, incurable viral encephalitis. The causative agents are neurotropic RNA viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. Mammalian reservoirs include the Carnivora and Chiroptera, but rabid dogs still pose the greatest hazard worldwide. Viral transmission occurs mainly via animal bite, and once the virus is deposited in peripheral wounds, centripetal passage occurs towards the central nervous system. After viral replication, there is centrifugal spread to major exit portals, the salivary glands. The epidemiological significance of any host "carrier" state remains highly speculative. Although incubation periods average 1-3 months, disease occurrence days or years after exposure has been documented. Rabies should be suspected in patients with a concomitant history of animal bite and traditional clinical presentation, but a lack of such clues makes antemortem diagnosis a challenge. Pathogenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood, and current care entails palliative measures only. Current medical emphasis relies heavily on prevention of exposure and intervention before clinical onset. Prophylaxis encompasses thorough wound treatment, vaccine administration, and inoculation of rabies immunoglobulin. Although it is a major zoonosis, canine rabies can be eliminated, and application of new vaccine technologies permits significant disease control among wildlife species. Nevertheless, despite much technical progress in the past century, rabies is a disease of neglect and presents a modern public-health conundrum.

   in The Netherlands, 1985-1996
AB To elucidate the mode of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) transmission in a population of Amsterdam drug users, HHV-8 seroprevalence and seroincidence were determined in 1179 drug users in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (1985-1996). Risk factors for HHV-8 infection were examined. Serum samples were screened with an enzyme immunoassay by using HHV-8 lytic capsid (open-reading frame [ORF] 65) and latent nuclear (ORF73) antigens; positive results were confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Seroprevalence (men, 3.4%; women, 1.4%) and seroincidence (men, 0.08; women, 0.05/100 person-years) were low in this study. Infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), but not HHV-8, were associated with injection drug use (IDU). Independent risk factors for HHV-8 seropositivity were homosexual contacts and Mediterranean nationality for men and sexual contact with bisexual men, absence of a steady partner, and unprotected commercial sex for women. Unlike HIV-1, HBV, or HCV infection, HHV-8 infection is uncommon in Amsterdam drug users, as is HHV-8 transmission through IDU.

TI The evolution of parasites from their hosts: intra- and interspecific
   parasitism and Emery's rule
AB In some taxa of Hymenoptera, fungi, red algae and mistletoe, parasites and their hosts are either sibling species or at least closely related (Emery's rule). Three evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed for this phenomenon: (i) intraspecific parasitism is followed by sympatric speciation; (ii) allopatric speciation is followed by secondary sympatry and the subsequent parasitism of one sibling species by the other; and (iii) allopatric speciation of a species with intraspecific parasitism is followed by secondary sympatry, in which one species becomes an obligate parasite of the other. Mechanisms (i) and (ii) are problematic, while mechanism (iii) has not, to our knowledge, been analysed quantitatively. In this paper, we develop a model for single- and two-species evolutionary stable strategies (ESSs) to examine the basis for Emery's rule and to determine whether mechanism (iii) is consistent with ESS reasoning. In secondary sympatry after allopatric speciation, the system's evolution depends on the relative abundances of the two sibling species and on the proportional damage wrought by parasites of each species on non-parasitic members of the other. Depending on these interspecific effects, either the rarer or the commoner species may become the parasite and the levels of within-species parasitism need not determine which evolves to obligate parasitism.

TI Epidemiology of inapparent and symptomatic acute dengue virus infection:
   A prospective study of primary school children in Kamphaeng Phet,
   Thailand
AB Dengue viruses are a major cause of morbidity in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Knowledge about the epidemiology and host determinants of inapparent and severe dengue virus infections is limited. In this paper, the authors report findings from the first 3 years of a prospective study of dengue virus transmission and disease severity conducted in a cohort of 2,119 elementary school children in northern Thailand. A total of 717,106 person-school days were observed from 1998 to 2000. The incidence of inapparent and of symptomatic dengue virus infection was 4.3% and 3.6% in 1998, 3.2% and 3.3% in 1999, and 1.4% and 0.8% in 2000, respectively. Symptomatic dengue virus infection was responsible for 3.2%, 7.1%, and 1.1% of acute-illness school absences in 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. The early symptom complex of acute dengue virus infection is protean and difficult to distinguish from other causes of febrile childhood illnesses. The authors' results illustrate the spatial and temporal diversity of dengue virus infection and the burden of dengue disease in schoolchildren in Thailand, Their findings increase understanding of dengue virus transmission and disease severity in a well-defined cohort population and offer a study design in which to test the efficacy of potential dengue vaccines.

   prospective study of primary school children in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand
AB Dengue virus occurs as four distinct serotypes, each of which causes epidemics throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Few studies have examined co-circulation of multiple dengue virus serotypes in a well-defined cohort population over time and their capacity to produce severe dengue disease. In this paper, the authors report the details and findings of the first 3 years (1998-2000) of an ongoing prospective study of dengue virus transmission and disease severity in a cohort of children in northern Thailand. A total of 108 dengue virus isolates were obtained from 167 acute dengue virus infections; 23% were DEN-1, 35% were DEN-2, 41% were DEN-3, and 1% were DEN-4. Despite the proximity of the schools, there was marked spatial and temporal clustering of transmission of each dengue serotype. Serotype-specific antibody levels prior to the dengue transmission season were not predictive of the incidence of dengue virus infections or the predominant serotype transmitted at individual schools. All dengue serotypes produced severe dengue illness, although DEN-3 produced more severe symptoms than the other dengue serotypes. The authors' findings emphasize the complexity of dengue serotype-specific virus transmission and severe dengue disease and have important implications for dengue control and vaccine development.

TI An outbreak of West Nile virus in a New York City captive wildlife
   population
AB An outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) in and around New York City during the late summer of 1999 was the cause of extensive mortality among free-ranging birds. Within the Bronx Zoo/Wildlife Conservation Park, viral activity was also observed and produced some morbidity and mortality among specimens in the zoo's bird collection and probably caused morbidity in at least one specimen from the zoo's mammal collection. To determine the extent of the outbreak and attempt to ascertain the temporal appearance of virus within the park, a serologic survey of birds and mammals was performed. The survey showed that 34% of tested birds (125 of 368; 124 species) were positive for antibody to WNV. The virus caused a disease to infection ratio of 22% (27 of 125) among birds with a 70% (19 of 27) case fatality rate. In contrast, only 8% of the mammals (9 of 117; 35 species) possessed antibody to WNV and there was no virus-associated mortality. Testing of banked and fresh sera obtained from both birds and mammals revealed that there was no evidence of WNV circulation before the 1999 outbreak and that birds introduced into the park were not the source of the New York outbreak. West Nile virus RNA was detected in tissues from one bird that died in February 2000, long after the end of the mosquito transmission season. The potential importance of zoologic parks as possible sentinels for emerging diseases is discussed.

TI Differential selection of baculovirus genotypes mediated by different
   species of host food plant
AB Recent studies have demonstrated high levels of genotypic and phenotypic variation in populations of parasites, even within individual hosts. Several genetic, immunological and epidemiological mechanisms have been postulated as promoters of such variation, but little empirical work has addressed the role of host ecology. A nucleopolyhedrovirus that attacks larvae of the pine beauty moth, Panolis flammea , exists as a complex mixture of genotypes within individual host larvae. We demonstrate that the food plant species eaten by the host (Scots pine vs. lodgepole pine) differentially affects the pathogenicity and productivity of two virus genotypes originally purified from a single host individual. We hypothesize that such food plant-mediated differential selection will promote genotypic variation between baculovirus populations, and that subsequent remixing of virus genotypes could maintain genotypic variation within individual hosts. Our results provide a tritrophic explanation for the genotypic and phenotypic complexity of host-parasite interactions with complex ecologies.

AB The capacity for mothers to transmit induced resistance against a specific parasite to their young may be an essential maternal effect that determines the fitness of offspring. In a previous study, antibodies against the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were detected in kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla ) eggs in relation to the exposure of birds to the tick vector Ixodes uriae . However, as yet, there has been no demonstration of a direct relationship between antibody concentrations in parents and young in a natural population. Here, we show, using the kittiwake-Borrelia system, the existence of a positive relationship between antibody concentrations in maternal serum and that in eggs and chick serum. No such relationship was found between paternal serum and eggs or young. These results suggest the existence of an adaptive maternal effect, an effect that should have important implications for the ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions.

TI Within- and between-population variation for Wolbachia-induced
   reproductive incompatibility in a haplodiploid mite
AB Wolbachia pipientis is a bacterium that induces cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), the phenomenon in which infected males are reproductively incompatible with uninfected females. CI spreads in a population of hosts because it reduces the fitness of uninfected females relative to infected females. CI encompasses two steps: modification (mod) of sperm of infected males and rescuing (resc) of these chromosomes by Wolbachia in the egg. Infections associated with CI have mod(+)resc(+) phenotypes. However, mod(-)resc(+) phenotypes also exist; these do not result in CI. Assuming mod/resc phenotypes are properties of the symbiont, theory predicts that mod(-)resc(+) infections can only spread in a host population where a mod(+)resc(+) infection already occurs. A mod(-)resc(+) infection spreads if the cost it imposes on the infected females is lower than the cost inflicted by the resident (mod(+)resc(+)) infection. Furthermore, introduction of a mod(-) Wolbachia eventually drives infection to extinction. The uninfected population that results can be recolonized by a CI-causing Wolbachia. Here, we investigated whether variability for induction of CI was present in two Tetranychus urticae populations. In one population all isofemale lines tested were mod(-). In the other, mod(+)resc(+) and mod(-)res(+) isofemale lines coexisted. We found no evidence for a cost difference to females expressing either type (mod(+)/(-)). Infections in the two populations could not be distinguished based on sequences of two Wolbachia genes. We consider the possibility that mod(-) is a host effect through a population dynamics model. A mod(-) host allele leads to infection extinction in the absence of fecundity differences. Furthermore, the uninfected population that results is immune to reestablishment of the (same) CI-causing Wolbachia.

TI Local adaptation in the Linum marginale-Melampsora lini host-pathogen
   interaction
AB The potential for local adaptation between pathogens and their hosts has generated strong theoretical and empirical interest with evidence both for and against local adaptation reported for a range of systems. We use the Linum marginale-Melampsora lini plant-pathogen system and a hierarchical spatial structure to investigate patterns of local adaptation within a metapopulation characterised by epidemic dynamics and frequent extinction of pathogen populations. Based on large sample sizes and comprehensive cross-inoculation trials, our analyses demonstrate strong local adaptation by Melampsora to its host populations, with this effect being greatest at regional scales, as predicted from the broader spatial scales at which M. lini disperses relative to L. marginole. However, there was no consistent trend for more distant pathogen populations to perform more poorly. Our results further show how the coevolutionary interaction between hosts and pathogens can be influenced by local structure such that resistant hosts select for generally virulent pathogens, while susceptible hosts select for more avirulent pathogens. Empirically, local adaptation has generally been tested in two contrasting ways: (1) pathogen performance on sympatric versus allopatric hosts; and (2) sympatric versus allopatric pathogens on a given host population. In situations where no host population is more resistant or susceptible than others when averaged across pathogen populations (and likewise, no pathogen population is more virulent or avirulent than others), results from these tests should generally be congruent. We argue that this is unlikely to be the case in the metapopulation situations that predominate in natural host-pathogen interactions, thus requiring tests that control simultaneously for variation in plant and pathogen populations.

TI Family-level covariation between parasite resistance and mating system
   in a hermaphroditic freshwater snail
AB Genetic compatibility, nonspecific defenses, and environmental effects determine parasite resistance. Host mating system (selfing vs. outcrossing) should be important for parasite resistance because it determines the segregation of alleles at the resistance loci and because inbreeding depression may hamper immune defenses. Individuals of a mixed mating hermaphroditic freshwater snail, Lymnaea ovata, are commonly infected by a digenetic trematode parasite, Echinoparyphium recurvatum. We examined covariation between quantitative resistance to novel parasites and mating system by exposing snail families from four populations that differed by their inbreeding coefficients. We found that resistance was unrelated to inbreeding coefficient of the population, suggesting that the more inbred populations did not carry higher susceptibility load than the less inbred populations. Most of the variation in resistance was expressed among the families within the populations. In the population with the lowest inbreeding coefficient, resistance increased with outcrossing rate of the family, as predicted if selfing had led to inbreeding depression. In the other three populations with higher inbreeding coefficients, resistance was unrelated to outcrossing rate. The results suggest that in populations with higher inbreeding some of the genetic load has been purged, uncoupling the predicted relationship between outcrossing rate and resistance. Snail families also displayed crossing reaction norms for resistance when tested in two environments that presented low and high immune challenge, suggesting that genotype-by-environment interactions are important for parasite resistance.

TI Local adaptation and effect of host genotype on the rate of pathogen
   evolution: an experimental test in a plant pathosystem
AB Virulence is thought to be a driving force in host-pathogen coevolution. Theoretical models suggest that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of pathogens evolving towards a high rate of intrahost reproduction. These models predict a positive correlation between the reproductive fitness of a pathogen and its level of virulence. Theoretical models also suggest that the demography and genetic structure of a host population can influence the evolution of virulence. If evolution occurs faster in pathogen populations than in host populations, the predicted result is local adaptation of the pathogen population. In our studies, we used a combination of molecular and physiological markers to test these hypotheses in an agricultural system. We isolated five strains of the fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola from each of two wheat cultivars that differed in their level of resistance to this pathogen. Each of the 10 fungal strains had distinct genotypes as indicated by different DNA fingerprints. These fungal strains were re-inoculated onto the same two host cultivars in a field experiment and their genotype frequencies were monitored over several generations of asexual reproduction. We also measured the virulence of these 10 fungal strains and correlated it to the reproductive fitness of each fungal strain. We found that host genotypes had a strong impact on the dynamics of the pathogen populations. The pathogen population collected from the moderately resistant cultivar Madsen showed greater stability, higher genotype diversity, and smaller selection coefficients than the pathogen populations collected from the susceptible cultivar Stephens or a mixture of the two host cultivars. The pathogen collection from the mixed host population was midway between the two pure lines for most parameters measured. Our results also revealed that the measures of reproductive fitness and virulence of a pathogen strain were not always correlated. The pathogen strains varied in their patterns of local adaptation, ranging from locally adapted to locally maladapted.

TI The Ratchet and the Red Queen: the maintenance of sex in parasites
AB The adaptive significance of sexual reproduction remains as an unsolved problem in evolutionary biology. One promising hypothesis is that frequency-dependent selection by parasites selects for sexual reproduction in hosts, but it is unclear whether such selection on hosts would feed back to select for sexual reproduction in parasites. Here we used individual-based computer simulations to explore this possibility. Specifically, we tracked the dynamics of asexual parasites following their introduction into sexual parasite populations for different combinations of parasite virulence and transmission. Our results suggest that coevolutionary interactions with hosts would generally lead to a stable coexistence between sexual parasites and a single parasite clone. However, if multiple mutations to asexual reproduction were allowed, we found that the interaction led to the accumulation of clonal diversity in the asexual parasite population, which led to the eventual extinction of the sexual parasites. Thus, coevolution with sexual hosts may not be generally sufficient to select for sex in parasites. We then allowed for the stochastic accumulation of mutations in the finite parasite populations (Muller's Ratchet). We found that, for higher levels of parasite virulence and transmission, the population bottlenecks resulting from host-parasite coevolution led to the rapid accumulation of mutations in the clonal parasites and their elimination from the population. This result may explain the observation that sexual reproduction is more common in parasitic animals than in their free-living relatives.

TI A distinct Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera : Sternorrhyncha :
   Aleyrodidae) genotype cluster is associated with the epidemic of severe
   cassava mosaic virus disease in Uganda
AB During the 1990s, an epidemic of cassava mosaic virus disease caused major losses to cassava production in Uganda. Two factors associated with the epidemic were the occurrence of a novel recombinant begomovirus, EACMV-Ug, and unusually high populations of the whitefly vector, Bemisia tabaci. Here we present molecular evidence for the occurrence of two cassava-colonizing B. tabaci genotype clusters, Ug1 and Ug2, one of which, Ug2, can be consistently associated with the CMD epidemic in Uganda at the time of collection in 1997. By contrast, a second genotype cluster, Ug1, only occurred 'at' or 'ahead of' the epidemic 'front', sometimes in mixtures with Ug2. Comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene sequences for Ug1 and Ug2 and well-studied B. tabaci reference populations indicated that the two Ugandan populations exhibited approximate to8% divergence, suggesting they represent distinct sub-Saharan African lineages. Neither Ugandan genotype cluster was identified as the widely distributed, polyphagous, and highly fecund B biotype of Old World origin, with which they both diverged by approximate to8%. Within genotype cluster divergence of Ug1 at 0.61+/-0.1% was twice that of Ug2 at 0.35+/-0.1%. Mismatch analysis suggested that Ug2 has undergone a recent population expansion and may be of non-Ugandan origin, whereas Ug1 has diverged more slowly, and is likely to be an indigenous genotype cluster.

TI Sex-specific genetic structure in Schistosoma mansoni: evolutionary and
   epidemiological implications
AB We studied the population genetic structure of 360 and, 1247 adult Schistosoma mansoni using seven microsatellite and seven random amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, respectively. Parasites were collected from their natural definitive host Rattus rattus in Guadeloupe (West Indies). We found a sex-specific genetic structure, a pattern never before reported in a parasitic organism. Male genotypes were more randomly distributed among rats than female genotypes. This interpretation was consistent with a lower differentiation between hosts for males relative to females, the higher genetic similarity between females in the same host and the observed local (i.e. within-individual-host) differences in allele frequencies between the two sexes. We discuss our results using ecological and immuno,logical perspectives on host-parasite relationships. These results change our view on the epidemiology of schistosomiasis, a serious disease affecting humans in African and American intertropical zones.

TI On the evolution of virulence and the relationship between various
   measures of mortality
AB Smallpox causes roughly 20% mortality whereas chickenpox causes less than 0.1%. Most 'verbal' (i.e. non-mathematical) discussions using a mortality definition of virulence would therefore label smallpox as more virulent. Indeed, the virulence of many diseases is measured using such case mortalities, chi, or related measures such as expected host lifespan, T, or lethal dose, LDx. But chi, T and LDx are only indirectly related to parasite-induced instantaneous mortality rate, alpha, which is the mortality measure used in much of the theory developed to explain virulence evolution. Here I point out that relatively deadly pathogens can actually have lower values of alpha than benign pathogens, demonstrating that alpha does not, by itself, reflect the extent to which a parasite causes host mortality. I present mathematical relationships between alpha and chi, T and LDx, and use these to demonstrate that predictions about virulence evolution can be qualitatively altered depending upon which measure is used as the definition of virulence. Two simple examples are presented to illustrate this point, one of which demonstrates that the well-cited prediction that virulence should evolve to be higher when disease-independent host mortality increases need not hold. This prediction has been made in terms of parasite-induced instantaneous mortality, alpha, but if virulence is measured using case mortality (or T or LDx) then this prediction can easily be reversed. Theoretical and empirical researchers must use compatible mortality measures before a productive exchange between the two can take place, and it is suggested that case mortality (or lethal dose) is best suited as a single (mortality) measure of parasite virulence.
