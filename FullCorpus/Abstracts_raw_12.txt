TI No detectable effect of Wolbachia wMel on the prevalence and abundance
   of the RNA virome of Drosophila melanogaster
AB Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium that can block viral infections in arthropods, generating interest in its potential to control the spread of mas-quito-borne disease. Drosophila melanogaster is model organism for Wolbachia infection, and the wMel strain of Wolbachia can improve host survival following viral infection. However, it is unclear whether wMel induces anti-viral blocking against the broader native virome of D. melanogaster, or whether the major effect of Wolbachia is a reduction in viral abundance rather than viral clearance. We examined the effect of Wolbachia on viral abundance by comparing the total transcriptome of wMel-positive and wMel-negative D. melanogaster populations sampled from six locations in Australia. In addition, we examined the impact of wMel on individual flies by obtaining transcriptorne data from 20 wMel-positive and 20 wMel-negative D. melanogaster from the location (Melbourne) with highest density of wMel. These data revealed high viral abundance in both Wolbachia-positive and -negative populations and individuals. Notably, one of the viral species identified, representing RNA viruses from at least nine families/floating genera, showed evidence of protection by wMel. Although the viral loads of picoma-like viruses are reduced by wMel under experimental conditions, we observed no such effect here. These data show that D. melanogaster can harbour abundant RNA viruses regardless of its Wolbachia status and imply that the interaction between Wolbachia and viruses in nature is m ore complex than simple blocking.

TI Toward an integrative molecular approach to wildlife disease
AB Pathogens pose serious threats to human health, agricultural investment, and biodiversity conservation through the emergence of zoonoses, spillover to domestic livestock, and epizootic outbreaks. As such, wildlife managers are often tasked with mitigating the negative effects of disease. Yet, parasites form a major component of biodiversity that often persist. This is due to logistical challenges of implementing management strategies and to insufficient understanding of host-parasite dynamics. We advocate for an inclusive understanding of molecular diversity in driving parasite infection and variable host disease states in wildlife systems. More specifically, we examine the roles of genetic, epigenetic, and commensal microbial variation in disease pathogenesis. These include mechanisms underlying parasite virulence and host resistance and tolerance, and the development, regulation, and parasite subversion of immune pathways, among other processes. Case studies of devil facial tumor disease in Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and chytridiomycosis in globally distributed amphibians exemplify the broad range of questions that can be addressed by examining different facets of molecular diversity. For particularly complex systems, integrative molecular analyses present a promising frontier that can provide critical insights necessary to elucidate disease dynamics operating across scales. These insights enable more accurate risk assessment, reconstruction of transmission pathways, discernment of optimal intervention strategies, and development of more effective and ecologically sound treatments that minimize damage to the host population and environment. Such measures are crucial when mitigating threats posed by wildlife disease to humans, domestic animals, and species of conservation concern.

TI Unilateral Phrenic Nerve Palsy in Infants with Congenital Zika Syndrome
AB Since the first identification of neonatal microcephaly cases associated with congenital Zika virus infection in Brazil in 2015, a distinctive constellation of clinical features of congenital Zika syndrome has been described. Fetal brain disruption sequence is hypothesized to underlie the devastating effects of the virus on the central nervous system. However, little is known about the effects of congenital Zika virus infection on the peripheral nervous system. We describe a series of 4 cases of right unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in infants with congenital Zika syndrome suggesting peripheral nervous system involvement and Zika virus as a unique congenital infectious cause of this finding. All the patients described also had arthrogryposis (including talipes equinovarus) and died from complications related to progressive respiratory failure.

TI Comparison of three cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in Western Australia:
   2003, 2007 and 2011
AB Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that causes the diarrhoeal disease, cryptosporidiosis. Although many species have been identified, the majority of human disease worldwide is caused by two species; Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis. In Australia, data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) show that cryptosporidiosis outbreaks occur every few years. To better understand the transmission, trends and nature of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in Western Australia, epidemiological and genomic data from three cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in 2003, 2007 and 2011 were reviewed. The 2007 outbreak was the largest (n = 607) compared with the outbreaks in 2003 (n = 404) and 2011 (n = 355). All three outbreaks appeared to have occurred predominantly in the urban metropolitan area (Perth), which reported the highest number of case notifications; increases in case notifications were also observed in rural and remote areas. Children aged 0-4 years and non-Aboriginal people comprised the majority of notifications in all outbreaks. However, in the 2003 and 2007 outbreaks, a higher proportion of cases from Aboriginal people was observed in the remote areas. Molecular data were only available for the 2007 (n = 126) and 2011 (n = 42) outbreaks, with C. hominis the main species identified in both outbreaks. Subtyping at the glycoprotein 60 (gp60) locus identified subtype IbA10G2 in 46.3% and 89.5% of C. hominis isolates typed, respectively, in the 2007 and 2011 outbreaks, with the IdA15G1 subtype was identified in 33.3% of C. hominis isolates typed in the 2007 outbreak. The clustering of cases with the IdA15G1 subtype in the remote areas suggests the occurrence of a concurrent outbreak in remote areas during the 2007 outbreak, which primarily affected Aboriginal people. Both the C. hominis IbA10G2 and IdA15G1 subtypes have been implicated in cryptosporidiosis outbreaks worldwide; its occurrence indicates that the mode of transmission in both the 2007 and 2011 outbreaks was anthroponotic. To better understand the epidemiology, sources and transmission of cryptosporidiosis in Australia, genotyping data should routinely be incorporated into national surveillance programmes.

TI Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: risk factors and
   determinants of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission
AB Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonosis that causes death in 35.7% of cases. As of Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths). MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security. Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined. Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection. The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections. Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV. The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths. This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East. The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made. With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive update and synthesis of the latest available data on the epidemiology, determinants, and risk factors of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV, and suggest measures to reduce risk of transmission.

TI Island fox spatial ecology and implications for management of disease
AB Disease, predation, and genetic isolation resulted in 4 of 6 island fox (Urocyon littoralis) subspecies being listed as endangered in 2004. Potential for disease outbreaks continues to pose a major threat to the persistence of these isolated, endemic populations. We examined how roads influence the spatial ecology of San Clemente Island foxes (U. l. clementae), particularly in regard to spread of disease, to provide management recommendations for preventing or minimizing a disease outbreak on San Clemente Island, California, USA. Home range areas (=0.75km(2)) and core areas (=0.19km(2)) of foxes on San Clemente Island were 0.36-1.23 and 2.17 times larger, respectively, than estimates from Santa Cruz Island foxes (U. l. santacruzae). Home ranges and core areas were 78% larger and 73% larger, respectively, for foxes near roads than for foxes away from roads. Home ranges were also largest when foxes were not caring for offspring (i.e., seasons of pup-independence and breeding). We did not detect any dispersal movements, but foxes living near roads moved 33% farther in 2-hours periods than foxes not living near roads. Foxes near roads move faster, range more widely, and could more rapidly spread a pathogen throughout the island; therefore, roads might serve as transmission corridors. We recommend reducing this risk by increasing widths of vaccination firewalls (areas where vaccination is used to induce a disease-resistant or immune population of foxes), ensuring these areas deliberately intersect roads, and vaccinating a higher proportion of foxes living near roads. Disease risk models incorporating these strategies could inform the lowest risk scenarios. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

TI Contact rates in wild boar populations: Implications for disease
   transmission
AB Inter-individual contacts in wildlife populations are usually highly heterogeneous. This variation translates into differential disease transmission rates between individuals, which have vital consequences for the spread, persistence, and control of infectious diseases. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an abundant game species across Europe that poses serious health threats to wildlife, livestock, and humans. However, factors shaping contact rates and structure in wild boar populations, key parameters in disease ecology, remain poorly studied. We quantified dyadic association rates, as a proxy of contacts, and individual-based network centrality measures using telemetry data from 3 wild boar populations across Europe. Next, we examined the effect of sex, age, group membership, and space use on association rates and individual centrality. Contact rates depended strongly on the distance between individual home ranges; the most frequent associations occurred at distances of 0-1km (mostly within groups), less frequent at 1-3km (mostly between groups), and sporadic at >4km. Association rates were an order of magnitude higher within social groups than between them. Between-group association rates were only dependent on the distance between groups, with no apparent effect of animal sex or age. At the social network level, young animals (0.5-2 yr) showed greater between-group connectivity and a more central position in the network than adults. Our results highlight substantial contact heterogeneities in wild boar populations, which should be considered in epidemiological modeling and disease control actions. First, wild boar contact rates are strongly constrained socially and spatially. Hence, management measures reducing these constraints, such as supplementary feeding and intensive hunting, may lead to increased disease transmission rates. Second, young wild boars show exceptional connectivity within the population, highlighting their high capacity for disease transmission. Therefore, targeted removal of yearlings should be considered to optimize disease control efforts. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

TI Respiratory disease, behavior, and survival of mountain goat kids
AB Bacterial pneumonia is a threat to bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations. Bighorn sheep in the East Humboldt Mountain Range (EHR), Nevada, USA, experienced a pneumonia epizootic in 2009-2010. Testing of mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) that were captured or found dead on this range during and after the epizootic detected bacteria commonly associated with bighorn sheep pneumonia die-offs. Additionally, in years subsequent to the bighorn sheep epizootic, the mountain goat population had low kid:adult ratios, a common outcome for bighorn sheep populations that have experienced a pneumonia epizootic. We hypothesized that pneumonia was present and negatively affecting mountain goat kids in the EHR. From June-August 2013-2015, we attempted to observe mountain goat kids with marked adult females in the EHR at least once per week to document signs of respiratory disease; identify associations between respiratory disease, activity levels, and subsequent disappearance (i.e., death); and estimate weekly survival. Each time we observed a kid with a marked adult female, we recorded any signs of respiratory disease and collected behavior data that we fit to a 3-state discrete hidden Markov model (HMM) to predict a kid's state (active vs. sedentary) and its probability of disappearing. We first observed clinical signs of respiratory disease in kids in late July-early August each summer. We observed 8 of 31 kids with marked adult females with signs of respiratory disease on 13 occasions. On 11 of these occasions, the HMM predicted that kids were in the sedentary state, which was associated with increased probability of subsequent death. We estimated overall probability of kid survival from June-August to be 0.19 (95% CI=0.08-0.38), which was lower than has been reported in other mountain goat populations. We concluded that respiratory disease was present in the mountain goat kids in the EHR and negatively affected their activity levels and survival. Our results raise concerns about potential effects of pneumonia to mountain goat populations and the potential for disease transmission between mountain goats and bighorn sheep where the species are sympatric.

TI Genomewide signatures of selection in Epichloe reveal candidate genes
   for host specialization
AB Host specialization is a key process in ecological divergence and speciation of plant-associated fungi. The underlying determinants of host specialization are generally poorly understood, especially in endophytes, which constitute one of the most abundant components of the plant microbiome. We addressed the genetic basis of host specialization in two sympatric subspecies of grass-endophytic fungi from the Epichloe typhina complex: subsp. typhina and clarkii. The life cycle of these fungi entails unrestricted dispersal of gametes and sexual reproduction before infection of a new host, implying that the host imposes a selective barrier on viability of the progeny. We aimed to detect genes under divergent selection between subspecies, experiencing restricted gene flow due to adaptation to different hosts. Using pooled whole-genome sequencing data, we combined F-ST and D-XY population statistics in genome scans and detected 57 outlier genes showing strong differentiation between the two subspecies. Genomewide analyses of nucleotide diversity (), Tajima's D and dN/dS ratios indicated that these genes have evolved under positive selection. Genes encoding secreted proteins were enriched among the genes showing evidence of positive selection, suggesting that molecular plant-fungus interactions are strong drivers of endophyte divergence. We focused on five genes encoding secreted proteins, which were further sequenced in 28 additional isolates collected across Europe to assess genetic variation in a larger sample size. Signature of positive selection in these isolates and putative identification of pathogenic function supports our findings that these genes represent strong candidates for host specialization determinants in Epichloe endophytes. Our results highlight the role of secreted proteins as key determinants of host specialization.

TI Genome-wide DNA methylation signatures of infection status in
   Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
AB Epigenetic modification, especially DNA methylation, can play an important role in mediating gene regulatory response to environmental stressors and may be a key process affecting phenotypic plasticity and adaptation. Parasites are potent stressors with profound physiological and ecological effects on their hosts, yet it remains unclear how parasites influence host methylation patterns. Here, we used a well-studied host-parasite system, the guppy Poecilia reticulata and its ectoparasitic monogenean Gyrodactylus turnbulli to gain mechanistic insight into the dynamics of DNA methylation in host-parasite interactions. To explore this, we quantitatively measured genome-wide DNA methylation in guppy skin tissue using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and characterized differential methylation patterns in guppies during distinct phases of infection. We identified 365, 313, and 741 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between infected and control fish in early infection, peak infection and recovery phases, respectively. The magnitude of the methylation difference was moderate in DMRs, with an average of 29% (early infection), 27% (peak infection) and 30% (recovery) differential methylation per DMR. Approximately 50% of DMRs overlapped with CpG islands, and over half of the DMRs overlapped with gene bodies, several of which encode proteins relevant to immune response. These findings provide the first evidence of an epigenetic signature of infection by ectoparasites and demonstrate the changing relationship between epigenetic variation and immune response in distinct phases of infection.

TI Design Strategy of the Sabes Study: Diagnosis and Treatment of Early HIV
   Infection Among Men Who Have Sex With Men and Transgender Women in Lima,
   Peru, 2013-2017
AB The Sabes Study evaluated a treatment-as-prevention intervention among cisgender men who have sex with men and transgender women in Lima, Peru-populations disproportionately affected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. The intervention was designed to prevent onward transmission of HIV by identifying HIV-negative high-risk individuals, testing them monthly for the presence of HIV, and then rapidly treating those who became HIV-positive. The main outcome of interest was the development of a model predicting the population-level impact of early detection of HIV infection and immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy in this population. From July 2013 to September 2015, a total of 3,337 subjects were screened for HIV; 2,685 (80.5%) were negative, and 2,109 began monthly testing. We identified 256 individuals shortly after HIV acquisition, 216 of whom were enrolled in the treatment phase of the study. All participants were followed for 48 weeks (follow-up ended in 2017) and were then referred to the Peruvian Ministry of Health to continue receiving free HIV care and treatment. Initial findings from this intervention demonstrate that it is possible to recruit high-risk individuals, screen them for HIV, continue to test those who are initially HIV-negative in order to identify incident cases shortly after acquisition, and then rapidly link them to health care.

TI Experimental demonstration of the impact of hard and soft selection
   regimes on polymorphism maintenance in spatially heterogeneous
   environments
AB Predicting and managing contemporary adaption requires a proper understanding of the determinants of genetic variation. Spatial heterogeneity of the environment may stably maintain polymorphism when habitat contribution to the next generation can be considered independent of the degree of adaptation of local populations within habitats (i.e., under soft selection). In contrast, when habitats contribute proportionally to the mean fitness of the populations they host (hard selection), polymorphism is not expected to be maintained by selection. Although mathematically established decades ago, this prediction had never been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we provide an experimental test in which polymorphic populations of Escherichia coli growing in heterogeneous habitats were exposed to hard and soft selection regimes. As predicted by theory, polymorphism was preserved longer under soft selection. Complementary tests established that soft selection slowed fixation processes and could even protect polymorphism in the long term by providing a systematic advantage to rare genotypes.

TI Co-occurrence among three divergent plant-castrating fungi in the same
   Silene host species
AB The competitive exclusion principle postulates that different species can only coexist in sympatry if they occupy distinct ecological niches. The goal of this study was to understand the geographical distribution of three species of Microbotryum anther-smut fungi that are distantly related but infect the same host plants, the sister species Silenevulgaris and S.uniflora, in Western Europe. We used microsatellite markers to investigate pathogen distribution in relation to host specialization and ecological factors. Microbotryum violaceo-irregulare was only found on S.vulgaris at high elevations in the Alps. Microbotryumlagerheimii could be subdivided into two genetically differentiated clusters, one on S.uniflora in the UK and the second on S.vulgaris in the Alps and Pyrenees. The most abundant pathogen species, M.silenes-inflatae, could be subdivided into four genetic clusters, co-occurring in the Alps, the UK and the Pyrenees, and was found on both S.vulgaris and S.uniflora. All three fungal species had high levels of homozygosity, in agreement with the selfing mating system generally observed in anther-smut fungi. The three pathogen species and genetic clusters had large range overlaps, but occurred at sites with different elevations, temperatures and precipitation levels. The three Microbotryum species thus do not appear to be maintained by host specialization or geographic allopatry, but instead may occupy different ecological niches in terms of environmental conditions.

TI The cotton stainer's gut microbiota suppresses infection of a
   cotransmitted trypanosomatid parasite
AB The evolutionary and ecological success of many insects is attributed to mutualistic partnerships with bacteria that confer hosts with novel traits including food digestion, nutrient supplementation, detoxification of harmful compounds and defence against natural enemies. Dysdercus fasciatus firebugs (Hemiptera: Pyrrhocoridae), commonly known as cotton stainers, possess a simple but distinctive gut bacterial community including B vitamin-supplementing Coriobacteriaceae symbionts. In addition, their guts are often infested with the intestinal trypanosomatid parasite Leptomonas pyrrhocoris (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae). In this study, using experimental bioassays and fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISH), we report on the protective role of the D.fasciatus gut bacteria against L.pyrrhocoris. We artificially infected 2nd instars of dysbiotic and symbiotic insects with a parasite culture and measured parasite titres, developmental time and survival rates. Our results show that L.pyrrhocoris infection increases developmental time and slightly modifies the quantitative composition of the gut microbiota. More importantly, we found significantly higher parasite titres and a tendency towards lower survival rates in parasite-infected dysbiotic insects compared to symbiotic controls, indicating that the gut bacteria successfully interfere with the establishment or proliferation of L.pyrrhocoris. The colonization of symbiotic bacteria on the peritrophic matrix along the gut wall, as revealed by FISH, likely acts as a barrier blocking parasite attachment or entry into the hemolymph. Our findings show that in addition to being nutritionally important, D.fasciatus' gut bacteria complement the host's immune system in preventing parasite invasions and that a stable gut microbial community is integral for the host's health.

TI Simulation of population dynamics of Bulinus globosus: Effects of
   environmental temperature on production of Schistosoma haematobium
   cercariae
AB Background
   Temperature is an important factor that influences the biology and ecology of intermediate host (IH) snails and the schistosome parasites they transmit. Although temperature shifts due to climate change has been predicted to affect the life history traits of IH snails and parasite production, the mechanisms of how this may affect parasite abundance and disease risks are still not clear.
   Materials and methods
   Using data from laboratory and field experiments, we developed a deterministic compartmental simulation model based on difference equations using a weekly time step that represented the life cycle of Bulinus globosus. We simulated snail population dynamics and the associated production of cercariae assuming current environmental temperatures as well as projected temperature increases of 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C.
   Results
   The model generated snail fecundity and survival rates similar to those observed in the laboratory and also produced reasonable snail population dynamics under seasonally varying temperatures representative of generally favorable environmental conditions. Simulated relative abundances of both snails and cercariae decreased with increasing environmental temperatures, with maximum snail abundances decreased by 14% and 27%, and maximum cercariae productions decreased by 8% and 17%, when temperatures were increased by 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C, respectively.
   Conclusion
   The results indicate that future rise in temperature due to climate change may alter the abundance of B. globosus and impact on the prevalence of schistosomiasis. Furthermore, increased temperatures may not linearly influence the abundance of S. haematobium. These results may have important implications for schistosomiasis control programmes in view of temperature driven changes in the life history traits of B. globosus and S. haematobium. Our study recommends that the use of deterministic models incorporating the effects of temperature on the life history traits of IH snails would be vital in understanding the potential impact of climate change on schistosomiasis incidences and prevalence.

TI Stratified sero-prevalence revealed overall high disease burden of
   dengue but suboptimal immunity in younger age groups in Pune, India
AB Background
   In India, dengue disease is emerging as the most important vector borne public health problem due to rapid and unplanned urbanization, high human density and week management of the disease. Clinical cases are grossly underreported and not much information is available on prevalence and incidence of the disease.
   Methodology
   A cross sectional, stratified, facility based, multistage cluster sampling was conducted between May 4 and June 27, 2017 in Pune city. A total of 1,434 participants were enrolled. The serum samples were tested for detection of historical dengue IgG antibodies by ELISA using the commercial Panbio Dengue IgG Indirect ELISA kit. Anti-dengue IgG-capture Panbio ELISA was used for detection of high titered antibodies to detect recent secondary infection. We used this data to estimate key transmission parameters like force of infection and basic reproductive number. A subset of 120 indirect ELISA positive samples was also tested for Plaque Reduction Neutralizing Antibodies for determining serotype-specific prevalence.
   Findings
   Overall, 81% participants were infected with dengue virus (DENV) at least once if not more. The positivity was significantly different in different age groups. All the adults above 70 years were positive for DENV antibodies. Over 69% participants were positive for neutralizing antibodies against all 4 serotypes suggesting intense transmission of all DENV serotypes in Pune. Age-specific seroprevalence was consistent with long-term, endemic circulation of DENV. There was an increasing trend with age, from 21.6% among < 36 months to 59.4% in age group 10-12 years. We estimate that 8.68% of the susceptible population gets infected by DENV each year resulting into more than 3,00,000 infections and about 47,000 to 59,000 cases per year. This transmission intensity is similar to that reported from other known hyper-endemic settings in Southeast Asia and the Americas but significantly lower than report from Chennai.
   Conclusions
   Our study suggests that Pune city has high disease burden, all 4 serotypes are circulating, significant spatial heterogeneity in seroprevalence and suboptimal immunity in younger age groups. This would allow informed decisions to be made on management of dengue and introduction of upcoming dengue vaccines in the city.

TI Field-collected Triatoma sordida from central Brazil display high
   microbiota diversity that varies with regard to developmental stage and
   intestinal segmentation
AB Background/Methodology
   Triatomine bugs are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease. Vector control has for decades relied upon insecticide spraying, but insecticide resistance has recently emerged in several triatomine populations. One alternative strategy to reduce T. cruzi transmission is paratransgenesis, whereby symbiotic bacteria are genetically engineered to produce T. cruzi-killing proteins in the vector's gut. This approach requires in-depth knowledge of the vectors' natural gut microbiota. Here, we use metagenomics (16S rRNA 454 pyrosequencing) to describe the gut microbiota of field-caught Triatoma sordida +/- likely the most common peridomestic triatomine in Brazil. For large nymphs (4 th and 5 th stage) and adults, we also studied separately the three main digestive-tract segments-anterior midgut, posterior midgut, and hindgut.
   Principal findings
   Bacteria of four phyla (12 genera) were present in both nymphs (all five stages) and adults, thus defining T. sordida's 'bacterial core': Actinobacteria (Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium, Dietzia, Gordonia, Nitriliruptor, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, Rhodococcus, and Williamsia), Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas and Sphingobium), and Firmicutes (Staphylococcus). We found some clear differences in bacterial composition and relative abundance among development stages; overall, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria increased, but Actinobacteria decreased, through development. Finally, the bacterial microbiotas of the bugs' anterior midgut, posterior midgut, and hindgut were sharply distinct.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our results identify the 'bacterial core set' of T. sordida and reveal important gut microbiota differences among development stages-particularly between 1st-3rd stage nymphs and adults. Further, we show that, within any given development stage, the vectors' gut cannot be regarded as a single homogeneous environment. Cultivable, non-pathogenic 'core' bacterial species may now be tested as candidates for paratransgenic control of T. cruzi transmission by T. sordida.

TI Spinal cord hypometabolism associated with infection by human T-cell
   lymphotropic virus type 1(HTLV-1)
AB Background
   HTLV-1 infection is endemic in Brazil. About 1 to 2% of the Brazilian population is estimated to be infected, but most infected HTLV-1 individuals do not know about their own infection, which favors the continuity of sexual and vertical virus transmission. In addition, HTLV-1 associated central nervous system diseases and their pathophysiologic mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of spinal cord metabolism, viral and inflammatory profiles with features of neurological presentation in HTLV-1 infected individuals.
   Methodology
   This is a cross-sectional study of a cohort including 48 HTLV-1 infected individuals clinically classified as asymptomatic-AG (N = 21), symptomatic-SG (N = 11) and HAM/TSP-HG (N = 16) and a nested case-control study with HTLV-1 infected individuals-HIG (N = 48) and HTLV-1 non infected controls-CG (N = 30) that had their spinal cord analysed by Positron Emission Tomography with 18F-Fluordeoxyglucose (18F-FDG PET/CT). HTLV-1 infected individuals had 18F-FDG PET/CT results analyzed with clinical and demographic data, proviral load, cytokines and chemokines in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
   Principal Findings
   18F-FDG PET/CT showed hypometabolism in the thoracic spinal cord in HTLV-1 infected individuals. The method had an accuracy of 94.4% to identify HAM/TSP. A greater involvement of the thoracic spinal cord was observed, although hypometabolism was also observed in the cervical spinal cord segment in HTLV-1 infected individuals. Individuals with HAM/TSP showed a pro-inflammatory profile in comparison to asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, with a higher level of Interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (ITAC/CXCL11), IL-6, IL-12p70 in the plasma; and ITAC, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8 (CXCL8) and TNF-alpha in the CSF. Using regression, thoracic spinal cord SUV (standardized uptake value) and CSF ITAC level were identified as the HAM/TSP predictors in the multivariate model.
   Conclusions
   18F-FDG PET/CT imaging showed spinal cord hypometabolism in most HTLV-1 infected individuals, even in the asymptomatic HTLV-1 group. Thoracic spinal cord hypometabolism and CSF-ITAC levels were identified predictors of HAM/TSP.
   Significance
   Our findings suggested that in most HTLV-1 infected individuals there was compromise of central nervous system (CNS) structures despite of the lack of clinical symptoms. To explain the found hypometabolism, the role of microcirculatory and metabolic factors in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases associated with HTLV-1 infection must be further investigated. It is paramount to evaluate the central nervous function and to compare the performance among HTLV-1 infected individuals considered asymptomatic to the uninfected controls.

TI Population genomics of Culiseta melanura, the principal vector of
   Eastern equine encephalitis virus in the United States
AB Background
   Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) (Togaviridae, Alphavirus) is a highly pathogenic mosquito-borne arbovirus that circulates in an enzootic cycle involving Culiseta melanura mosquitoes and wild Passeriformes birds in freshwater swamp habitats. Recently, the northeastern United States has experienced an intensification of virus activity with increased human involvement and northward expansion into new regions. In addition to its principal role in enzootic transmission of EEE virus among avian hosts, recent studies on the blood-feeding behavior of Cs. melanura throughout its geographic range suggest that this mosquito may also be involved in epizootic / epidemic transmission to equines and humans in certain locales. Variations in blood feeding behavior may be a function of host availability, environmental factors, and/or underlying genetic differences among regional populations. Despite the importance of Cs. melanura in transmission and maintenance of EEE virus, the genetics of this species remains largely unexplored.
   Methodology and principle findings
   To investigate the occurrence of genetic variation in Cs. melanura, the genome of this mosquito vector was sequenced resulting in a draft genome assembly of 1.28 gigabases with a contig N50 of 93.36 kilobases. Populations of Cs. melanura from 10 EEE virus foci in the eastern North America were genotyped with double-digest RAD-seq. Following alignment of reads to the reference genome, variant calling, and filtering, 40,384 SNPs were retained for downstream analyses. Subsequent analyses revealed genetic differentiation between northern and southern populations of this mosquito species. Moreover, limited fine-scale population structure was detected throughout northeastern North America, suggesting local differentiation of populations but also a history of ancestral polymorphism or contemporary gene flow. Additionally, a genetically distinct cluster was identified predominantly at two northern sites.
   Conclusion and significance
   This study elucidates the first evidence of fine-scale population structure in Cs. melanura throughout its eastern range and detects evidence of gene flow between populations in northeastern North America. This investigation provides the groundwork for examining the consequences of genetic variations in the populations of this mosquito species that could influence vector-host interactions and the risk of human and equine infection with EEE virus.

TI Characterising seasonal influenza epidemiology using primary care
   surveillance data
AB Understanding the epidemiology of seasonal influenza is critical for healthcare resource allocation and early detection of anomalous seasons. It can be challenging to obtain high-quality data of influenza cases specifically, as clinical presentations with influenza-like symptoms may instead be cases of one of a number of alternate respiratory viruses. We use a new dataset of confirmed influenza virological data from 2011-2016, along with high-quality denominators informing a hierarchical observation process, to model seasonal influenza dynamics in New South Wales, Australia. We use approximate Bayesian computation to estimate parameters in a climate-driven stochastic epidemic model, including the basic reproduction number R-0, the proportion of the population susceptible to the circulating strain at the beginning of the season, and the probability an infected individual seeks treatment. We conclude that R-0 and initial population susceptibility were strongly related, emphasising the challenges of identifying these parameters. Relatively high R-0 values alongside low initial population susceptibility were among the results most consistent with these data. Our results reinforce the importance of distinguishing between R-0 and the effective reproduction number (R-e) in modelling studies.

TI Modeling the impact of changes in day-care contact patterns on the
   dynamics of varicella transmission in France between 1991 and 2015
AB significant increase over time in children aged 0-3 years, and a decline in older individuals. A significant increase in day-care enrolment and structures' capacity in France was also observed in the last decade. In this work we investigate the potential interplay between an increase of contacts of young children possibly caused by earlier socialization in the community and varicella transmission dynamics. To this aim, we develop an age-structured mathematical model, informed with historical demographic data and contact matrix estimates in the country, accounting for longitudinal linear increase of early childhood contacts. While the reported overall varicella incidence is well reproduced independently of mixing variations, age-specific empirical trends are better captured by accounting for an increase in contacts among pre-school children in the last decades. We found that the varicella data are consistent with a 30% increase in the number of contacts at day-care facilities, which would imply a 50% growth in the contribution of 0-3y old children to overall yearly infections in 1991-2015. Our findings suggest that an earlier exposure to pathogens due to changes in day-care contact patterns, represents a plausible explanation for the epidemiological patterns observed in France. Obtained results suggest that considering temporal changes in social factors in addition to demographic ones is critical to correctly interpret varicella transmission dynamics.

TI Coinfection with Zika Virus (ZIKV) and Dengue Virus Results in
   Preferential ZIKV Transmission by Vector Bite to Vertebrate Host
AB Background. Several tropical cities are permissive to Aedes aegypti and dengue virus (DENV) endemicity and have allowed for invasion and circulation of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the same areas. People living in arbovirus-endemic regions have been simultaneously infected with >= 2 arboviruses.
   Methods. A. aegypti mosquitoes from Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas State in Brazil, were coinfected with circulating strains of DENV and ZIKV. The coinfected vectors were allowed to bite BALB/c mice.
   Results. A. aegypti from Manaus is highly permissive to monoinfection and coinfection with DENV and ZIKV and is capable of cotransmitting both pathogens by bite. Coinfection strongly influences vector competence, favoring transmission of ZIKV to the vertebrate host.
   Conclusions. This finding suggests that A. aegypti is an efficient vector of ZIKV and that ZIKV would be preferentially transmitted by coinfected A. aegypti. Coinfection in the vector population should be considered a new critical epidemiological factor and may represent a major public health challenge.

TI Borrelia afzelii alters reproductive success in a rodent host
AB The impact of a pathogen on the fitness and behaviour of its natural host depends upon the host-parasite relationship in a given set of environmental conditions. Here, we experimentally investigated the effects of Borrelia afzelii, one of the aetiological agents of Lyme disease in humans, on the fitness of its natural rodent host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), in semi-natural conditions with two contrasting host population densities. Our results show that B. afzelii can modify the reproductive success and spacing behaviour of its rodent host, whereas host survival was not affected. Infection impaired the breeding probability of large bank voles. Reproduction was hastened in infected females without alteration of the offspring size at birth. At low density, infected males produced fewer offspring, fertilized fewer females and had lower mobility than uninfected individuals. Meanwhile, the infection did not affect the proportion of offspring produced or the proportion of mating partner in female bank voles. Our study is the first to show that B. afzelii infection alters the reproductive success of the natural host. The effects observed could reflect the sickness behaviour due to the infection or they could be a consequence of a manipulation of the host behaviour by the bacteria.

TI Mosquito-borne transmission in urban landscapes: the missing link
   between vector abundance and human density
AB With escalating urbanization, the environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity of urban landscapes poses a challenge tomathematical models for the transmission of vector-borne infections. Classical coupled vector-human models typically assume that mosquito abundance is either independent from, or proportional to, human population density, implying a decreasing force of infection, or per capita infection rate with host number. We question these assumptions by introducing an explicit dependence between host and vector densities through different recruitment functions, whose dynamical consequences we examine in a modified model formulation. Contrasting patterns in the force of infection are demonstrated, including in particular increasing trends when recruitment grows sufficiently fast with human density. Interaction of these patterns with seasonality in temperature can give rise to pronounced differences in timing, relative peak sizes, and duration of epidemics. These proposed dependencies explain empirical dengue risk patterns observed in the city of Delhi where socioeconomic status has an impact on both human and mosquito densities. These observed risk trends with host density are inconsistent with current standard models. A better understanding of the connection between vector recruitment and host density is needed to address the population dynamics of mosquito-transmitted infections in urban landscapes.

TI Host-pathogen coevolution in the presence of predators: fluctuating
   selection and ecological feedbacks
AB Host-pathogen coevolution is central to shaping natural communities and is the focus of much experimental and theoretical study. For tractability, the vast majority of studies assume the host and pathogen interact in isolation, yet in reality, they will form one part of complex communities, with predation likely to be a particularly key interaction. Here, I present, to my knowledge, the first theoretical study to assess the impact of predation on the coevolution of costly host resistance and pathogen transmission. I show that fluctuating selection is most likely when predators selectively prey upon infected hosts, but that saturating predation, owing to large handling times, dramatically restricts the potential for fluctuations. I also show how host evolution may drive either enemy to extinction, and demonstrate that while predation selects for low host resistance and high pathogen infectivity, ecological feedbacks mean this results in lower infection rates when predators are present. I emphasize the importance of accounting for varying population sizes, and place the models in the context of recent experimental studies.

TI Disruption of skin microbiota contributes to salamander disease
AB Escalating occurrences of emerging infectious diseases underscore the importance of understanding microbiome-pathogen interactions. The amphibian cutaneous microbiome is widely studied for its potential to mitigate disease-mediated amphibian declines. Other microbial interactions in this system, however, have been largely neglected in the context of disease outbreaks. European fire salamanders have suffered dramatic population crashes as a result of the newly emerged Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). In this paper, we investigate microbial interactions on multiple fronts within this system. We show that wild, healthy fire salamanders maintain complex skin microbiotas containing Bsal-inhibitory members, but these community are present at a remarkably lowabundance. Through experimentation, we show that increasing bacterial densities of Bsal-inhibiting bacteria via daily addition slowed disease progression in fire salamanders. Additionally, we find that experimental-Bsal infection elicited subtle changes in the skin microbiome, with selected opportunistic bacteria increasing in relative abundance resulting in septicemic events that coincide with extensive destruction of the epidermis. These results suggest that fire salamander skin, in natural settings, maintains bacterial communities at numbers too low to confer sufficient protection against Bsal, and, in fact, the native skin microbiota can constitute a source of opportunistic bacterial pathogens that contribute to pathogenesis. By shedding light on the complex interaction between the microbiome and a lethal pathogen, these data put the interplay between skin microbiomes and a wildlife disease into a new perspective.

TI Variation in individual temperature preferences, not behavioural fever,
   affects susceptibility to chytridiomycosis in amphibians
AB The ability of wildlife populations to mount rapid responses to novel pathogens will be critical for mitigating the impacts of disease outbreaks in a changing climate. Field studies have documented that amphibians preferring warmer temperatures are less likely to be infected with the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). However, it is unclear whether this phenomenon is driven by behavioural fever or natural variation in thermal preference. Here, we placed frogs in thermal gradients, tested for temperature preferences and measured Bd growth, prevalence, and the survival of infected animals. Although there was significant individual- and species-level variation in temperature preferences, we found no consistent evidence of behavioural fever across five frog species. Interestingly, for species that preferred warmer temperatures, the preferred temperatures of individuals were negatively correlated with Bd growth on hosts, while the opposite correlation was true for species preferring cooler temperatures. Our results suggest that variation in thermal preference, but not behavioural fever, might shape the outcomes of Bd infections for individuals and populations, potentially resulting in selection for individual hosts and host species whose temperature preferences minimize Bd growth and enhance host survival during epidemics.

TI Microparasite dispersal in metapopulations: a boon or bane to the host
   population?
AB Although connectivity can promote host species persistence in a metapopulation, dispersal may also enable disease transmission, an effect further complicated by the impact that parasite distribution may have on host-parasite population dynamics. We investigated the effects of connectivity and initial parasite distribution (clustered or dispersed) on microparasite-host dynamics in experimental metapopulations, using guppies and Gyrodactylus turnbulli. We created metapopulations of guppies divided into four subpopulations and introduced either a low level of parasites to all subpopulations (dispersed) or a high level of parasites to one subpopulation (clustered). Controlled migration among subpopulations occurred every 10 days. In additional trials, we introduced low or high levels of parasites to isolated populations. Parasites persisted longer in metapopulations than in isolated populations. Mortality was lowest in isolated populations with low-level introductions. The interaction of connectivity and initial parasite distribution influenced parasite abundance. With low-level introductions, connectivity helped the parasite persist longer but had little effect on the hosts. With high levels, connectivity also benefited the hosts, lowering parasite burdens. These findings have implications for disease management and species conservation.

TI Seroepidemiology of varicella zoster virus infection in Vojvodina,
   Serbia
AB The present cross-sectional serosurvey constitutes the first effort to describe the varicella zoster virus (VZV) seroepidemiology in Serbia. An age-stratified serum bank of 3570 residual samples collected between 2015 and 2016 in each of the seven districts of the Vojvodina Province was tested for IgG anti-VZV antibodies with an enzyme immunoassay. Results were standardised into common units according to the European Sero-Epidemiology Network (ESEN2) methodology. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to examine the relationships between standardised anti-VZV positivity or logarithmically transformed antibody titres and demographic features of study subjects. Seropositivity (85% overall) increased with age, in parallel with geometric mean titres. By the time of school entry, 68% of children were immune. The slower subsequent acquisition of immunity leaves epidemiologically relevant proportions of adolescents (7%), young adults (6%) and especially females of reproductive age (6%) prone to more severe forms of varicella. In the ongoing pre-vaccine era, natural infection provides a high level of collective immunity, with the highest VZV transmission in children of preschool age. The detected gaps in VZV immunity of the Serbian population support the adoption of the official recommendations for varicella immunisation of non-immune adolescents and young adults, including non-pregnant women of childbearing age.

TI Disentangling synergistic disease dynamics: Implications for the viral
   biocontrol of rabbits
AB European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been exposed to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and myxoma virus (MYXV) in their native and invasive ranges for decades. Yet, the long-term effects of these viruses on rabbit population dynamics remain poorly understood.
   In this context, we analysed 17years of detailed capture-mark-recapture data (2000-2016) from Turretfield, South Australia, using a probabilistic state-space hierarchical modelling framework to estimate rabbit survival and epidemiological dynamics.
   While RHDV infection and disease-induced death were most prominent during annual epidemics in winter and spring, we found evidence for continuous infection of susceptible individuals with RHDV throughout the year. RHDV-susceptible rabbits had, on average, 25% lower monthly survival rates compared to immune individuals, while the average monthly force of infection in winter and spring was similar to 38%. These combined to result in an average infection-induced mortality rate of 69% in winter and spring.
   Individuals susceptible to MYXV and immune to RHDV had similar survival probabilities to those having survived infections from both viruses, whereas individuals susceptible to both RHDV and MYXV had higher survival probabilities than those susceptible to RHDV and immune to MYXV. This suggests that MYXV may reduce the future survival rates of individuals that endure initial MYXV infection.
   There was no evidence for long-term changes in disease-induced mortality and infection rates for either RHDV or MYXV.
   We conclude that continuous, year-round virus perpetuation (and perhaps heterogeneity in modes of transmission and infectious doses during and after epidemics) acts to reduce the efficiency of RHDV and MYXV as biocontrol agents of rabbits in their invasive range. However, if virulence can be maintained as relatively constant through time, RHDV and MYXV will likely continue realizing strong benefits as biocontrol agents.

TI Caste ratio adjustments in response to perceived and realised
   competition in parasites with division of labour
AB Colonial organisms with division of labour are assumed to achieve increased colony-level efficiency in task performance through functional specialisation of individuals into distinct castes. In social insects, ratios of individuals in different castes can adjust adaptively in response to external threats. However, whether flexibility in caste ratio also occurs in other social organisms with division of labour remains unclear. Some parasitic trematodes, in which clonal colonies within the snail intermediate host comprise a reproductive caste and a soldier caste, offer good systems to test the general nature of adaptive caste ratio adjustments. Using the trematode Philophthalmus sp. as model, we test whether trematode colonies shift their composition towards more soldiers when exposed to a sustained risk of invasion by a competitor parasite species, and/or when experiencing sustained, active competition. We also quantify the colony-level fitness impact of caste ratio adjustments, measured as the colony's output of larval infective stages. We conducted two long-term laboratory experiments on within-snail trematode colonies. First, snails harbouring Philophthalmus colonies were exposed to different levels of invasion risk by another trematode species, Maritrema novaezealandense. Second, the structure of Philophthalmus colonies was quantified after a year-long period of within-snail competition with the other trematode species. When facing the risk of invasion by a competitor, independently of the level of risk, Philophthalmus colonies showed a significant shift towards producing more soldiers, resulting in altered caste ratio. Similarly, when experiencing actual competition by another trematode established in the same snail, Philophthalmus colonies also adjusted by producing significantly more soldiers. Greater investments in defense via more soldiers had negative impacts on the establishment and size of the competitor's colonies. Nevertheless, the presence of the competitor reduced the fitness (output of infective stages) of Philophthalmus colonies, although the production of more soldiers mitigated that effect. Our findings demonstrate that trematode colonies with division of labour are capable of adaptive caste ratio adjustments in response to both the perceived threat of competition and actual competition, with trade-offs against reproductive success only apparent when soldier numbers are very high. Combined with results on social insects, our study suggests parallel adaptations of colonial organisms in phylogenetically disparate organisms.

TI Functional Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum Surface-Related
   Antigen as a Potential Blood-Stage Vaccine Target
AB Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion is a multistep process that involves a spectrum of interactions that are not well characterized. We have characterized a 113-kDa immunogenic protein, PF3D7_1431400 (PF14_0293), that possesses coiled-coil structures. The protein is localized on the surfaces of both merozoites and gametocytes, hence the name Plasmodium falciparum surface-related antigen (PfSRA). The processed 32-kDa fragment of PfSRA binds normal human erythrocytes with different sensitivities to enzyme treatments. Temporal imaging from initial attachment to internalization of viable merozoites revealed that a fragment of PfSRA, along with PfMSP1(19), is internalized after invasion. Moreover, parasite growth inhibition assays showed that PfSRA P1 antibodies potently inhibited erythrocyte invasion of both sialic acid-dependent and - independent parasite strains. Also, immunoepidemio-logical studies show that malaria-infected populations have naturally acquired antibodies against PfSRA. Overall, the results demonstrate that PfSRA has the structural and functional characteristics of a very promising target for vaccine development.

TI Role of animal movement and indirect contact among farms in transmission
   of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
AB Epidemiological models of the spread of pathogens in livestock populations primarily focus on direct contact between farms based on animal movement data, and in some cases, local spatial spread based on proximity between premises. The roles of other types of indirect contact among farms is rarely accounted for. In addition, data on animal movements is seldom available in the United States. However, the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in U.S. swine represents one of the best documented emergences of a highly infectious pathogen in the U.S. livestock industry, providing an opportunity to parameterize models of pathogen spread via direct and indirect transmission mechanisms in swine. Using observed data on pig movements during the initial phase of the PEDv epidemic, we developed a network-based and spatially explicit epidemiological model that simulates the spread of PEDv via both indirect and direct movement-related contact in order to answer unresolved questions concerning factors facilitating between-farm transmission. By modifying the likelihood of each transmission mechanism and fitting this model to observed epidemiological dynamics, our results suggest that between-farm transmission was primarily driven by direct mechanisms related to animal movement and indirect mechanisms related to local spatial spread based on geographic proximity. However, other forms of indirect transmission among farms, including contact via contaminated vehicles and feed, were responsible for high consequence transmission events resulting in the introduction of the virus into new geographic areas. This research is among the first reports of farm-level animal movements in the U.S. swine industry and, to our knowledge, represents the first epidemiological model of commercial U.S. swine using actual data on farm-level animal movement.

TI How effective are approaches to migrant screening for infectious
   diseases in Europe? A systematic review
AB Rates of migration to Europe, and within Europe, have increased in recent years, with considerable implications for health systems. Migrants in Europe face a disproportionate burden of tuberculosis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C, yet experience a large number of barriers to accessing statutory health care on arrival. A better understanding of how to deliver effective and cost-effective screening, vaccination, and health services to this group is now crucial. We did a systematic review to document and assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of approaches used for infectious diseases screening, and to explore facilitators and barriers experienced by migrants to accessing screening programmes. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched Embase, PubMed, PsychINFO, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science (1989 to July 1, 2015, updated on Jan 1, 2018), with no language restrictions, and systematically approached experts across the European Union (EU) for grey literature. Inclusion criteria were primary research studies assessing screening interventions for any infectious disease in the migrant (foreign-born) population residing in EU or European Economic Area (EEA) countries. Primary outcomes were the following effectiveness indicators: uptake of screening, coverage, infections detected, and treatment outcomes. Of 4112 unique records, 47 studies met our inclusion criteria, from ten European countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK) encompassing 248 402 migrants. We found that most European countries screening migrants focus on single diseases only-predominantly active or latent tuberculosis infection-and specifically target asylum seekers and refugees, with 22 studies reporting on other infections (including HIV and hepatitis B and C). An infection was detected in 3.74% (range 0.00-95.16) of migrants. Latent tuberculosis had the highest prevalence across all infections (median 15.02% [0.35-31.81]). Uptake of screening by migrants was high (median 79.50% [18.62-100.00]), particularly in primary health-care settings (uptake 96.77% [76.00-100.00]). However, in 24.62% (0.12-78.99) of migrants screening was not completed and a final diagnosis was not made. Pooled data highlight high treatment completion in migrants (83.79%, range 0.00-100.00), yet data were highly heterogeneous for this outcome, masking important disparities between studies and infections, with only 54.45% (35.71-72.27) of migrants with latent tuberculosis ultimately completing treatment after screening. Coverage of the migrant population in Europe is low (39.29% [14.53-92.50]). Data on cost-effectiveness were scarce, but suggest moderate to high cost-effectiveness of migrant screening programmes depending on migrant group and disease targeted. European countries have adopted a variety of approaches to screening migrants for infections; however, these are limited in scope to single diseases and a narrow subset of migrants, with low coverage. More emphasis must be placed on developing innovative and sustainable strategies to facilitate screening and treatment completion and improve health outcomes, encompassing multiple key infections with consideration given to a wider group of high-risk migrants. Policy makers and researchers involved with global migration need to ensure a longer-term view on improving health outcomes in migrant populations as they integrate into health systems in host countries.

TI Small-scale spatial variation in infection risk shapes the evolution of
   a Borrelia resistance gene in wild rodents
AB Spatial variation in pathogen-mediated selection is predicted to influence the evolutionary trajectory of host populations and lead to spatial variation in their immunogenetic composition. However, to date few studies have been able to directly link small-scale spatial variation in infection risk to host immune gene evolution in natural, nonhuman populations. Here, we use a natural rodent-Borrelia system to test for associations between landscape-level spatial variation in Borrelia infection risk along replicated elevational gradients in the Swiss Alps and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) evolution, a candidate gene for Borrelia resistance, across bank vole (Myodes glareolus) populations. We found that Borrelia infection risk (i.e., the product of Borrelia prevalence in questing ticks and the average tick load of voles at a sampling site) was spatially variable and significantly negatively associated with elevation. Across sampling sites, Borrelia prevalence in bank voles was significantly positively associated with Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. We observed a significant association between naturally occurring TLR2 polymorphisms in hosts and their Borrelia infection status. The TLR2 variant associated with a reduced likelihood of Borrelia infection was most common in rodent populations at lower elevations that face a high Borrelia infection risk, and its frequency changed in accordance with the change in Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. These results suggest that small-scale spatial variation in parasite-mediated selection affects the immunogenetic composition of natural host populations, providing a striking example that the microbial environment shapes the evolution of the host's immune system in the wild.

TI Sympatric Parasites Have Similar Host-Associated, but Asynchronous,
   Patterns of Diversification
AB Parasitism is a common symbiotic interaction across diverse natural systems. Using a comparative evolutionary approach, we investigated the contributions of both host phylogeny and abiotic factors toward diversification of phylogenetically independent endoparasites that inhabit essentially the same physical space. We tested for host-parasite and parasite-parasite phylogenetic concordance in western North American chipmunks (Rodentia: Sciuridae) and two distantly related species of pinworms (Nematoda: Oxyurida). Deep structure in molecular phylogenies revealed signals of host-associated divergence in both parasite species, while shallower phylogeographic structure varied between the two parasites. This suggests that although these parasites experienced similar landscapes and cyclic climate processes, temporally distinctive diversification events were associated with differences in the initiation of their association with host lineages. When climate cycles initiate diversification, partially congruent, but asynchronous, host-associated parasite phylogenies may emerge.

TI Parasite rearing and infection temperatures jointly influence disease
   transmission and shape seasonality of epidemics
AB Seasonal epidemics erupt commonly in nature and are driven by numerous mechanisms. Here, we suggest a new mechanism that could determine the size and timing of seasonal epidemics: rearing environment changes the performance of parasites. This mechanism arises when the environmental conditions in which a parasite is produced impact its performance independently from the current environment. To illustrate the potential for "rearing effects", we show how temperature influences infection risk (transmission rate) in a Daphnia-fungus disease system through both parasite rearing temperature and infection temperature. During autumnal epidemics, zooplankton hosts contact (eat) fungal parasites (spores) reared in a gradually cooling environment. To delineate the effect of rearing temperature from temperature at exposure and infection, we used lab experiments to parameterize a mechanistic model of transmission rate. We also evaluated the rearing effect using spores collected from epidemics in cooling lakes. We found that fungal spores were more infectious when reared at warmer temperatures (in the lab and in two of three lakes). Additionally, the exposure (foraging) rate of hosts increased with warmer infection temperatures. Thus, both mechanisms cause transmission rate to drop as temperature decreases over the autumnal epidemic season (from summer to winter). Simulations show how these temperature-driven changes in transmission rate can induce waning of epidemics as lakes cool. Furthermore, via thermally dependent transmission, variation in environmental cooling patterns can alter the size and shape of epidemics. Thus, the thermal environment drives seasonal epidemics through effects on hosts (exposure rate) and the infectivity of parasites (a rearing effect). Presently, the generality of parasite rearing effects remains unknown. Our results suggest that they may provide an important but underappreciated mechanism linking temperature to the seasonality of epidemics.

TI The molecular genetic basis of herbivory between butterflies and their

AB Interactions between herbivorous insects and their host plants are a central component of terrestrial food webs and a critical topic in agriculture, where a substantial fraction of potential crop yield is lost annually to pests. Important insights into plant-insect interactions have come from research on specific plant defences and insect detoxification mechanisms. Yet, much remains unknown about the molecular mechanisms that mediate plant-insect interactions. Here we use multiple genome-wide approaches to map the molecular basis of herbivory from both plant and insect perspectives, focusing on butterflies and their larval host plants. Parallel genome-wide association studies in the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae, and its host plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, pinpointed a small number of butterfly and plant genes that influenced herbivory. These genes, along with much of the genome, were regulated in a dynamic way over the time course of the feeding interaction. Comparative analyses, including diverse butterfly/plant systems, showed a variety of genome-wide responses to herbivory, as well as a core set of highly conserved genes in butterflies as well as their host plants. These results greatly expand our understanding of the genomic causes and evolutionary consequences of ecological interactions across two of nature's most diverse taxa, butterflies and flowering plants.

TI Gene exchange drives the ecological success of a multi-host bacterial
   pathogen
AB The capacity for some pathogens to jump into different host-species populations is a major threat to public health and food security. Staphylococcus aureus is a multi-host bacterial pathogen responsible for important human and livestock diseases. Here, using a population-genomic approach, we identify humans as a major hub for ancient and recent S. aureus host-switching events linked to the emergence of endemic livestock strains, and cows as the main animal reservoir for the emergence of human epidemic clones. Such host-species transitions are associated with horizontal acquisition of genetic elements from host-specific gene pools conferring traits required for survival in the new host-niche. Importantly, genes associated with antimicrobial resistance are unevenly distributed among human and animal hosts, reflecting distinct antibiotic usage practices in medicine and agriculture. In addition to gene acquisition, genetic diversification has occurred in pathways associated with nutrient acquisition, implying metabolic remodelling after a host switch in response to distinct nutrient availability. For example, S. aureus from dairy cattle exhibit enhanced utilization of lactose-a major source of carbohydrate in bovine milk. Overall, our findings highlight the influence of human activities on the multi-host ecology of a major bacterial pathogen, underpinned by horizontal gene transfer and core genome diversification.

TI Divergent parasite infections in sympatric cichlid species in Lake
   Victoria
AB Parasitism has been proposed as a factor in host speciation, as an agent affecting coexistence of host species in species-rich communities and as a driver of post-speciation diversification. Young adaptive radiations of closely related host species of varying ecological and genomic differentiation provide interesting opportunities to explore interactions between patterns of parasitism, divergence and coexistence of sympatric host species. Here, we explored patterns in ectoparasitism in a community of 16 fully sympatric cichlid species at Makobe Island in Lake Victoria, a model system of vertebrate adaptive radiation. We asked whether host niche, host abundance or host genetic differentiation explains variation in infection patterns. We found significant differences in infections, the magnitude of which was weakly correlated with the extent of genomic divergence between the host species, but more strongly with the main ecological gradient, water depth. These effects were most evident with infections of Cichlidogyrus monogeneans, whereas the only host species with a strictly crevice-dwelling niche, Pundamilia pundamilia, deviated from the general negative relationship between depth and parasitism. In accordance with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, we also found that host abundance tended to be positively associated with infections in some parasite taxa. Data on the Pundamilia sister species pairs from three other islands with variable degrees of habitat (crevice) specialization suggested that the lower parasite abundance of P.pundamilia at Makobe could result from both habitat specialization and the evolution of specific resistance. Our results support influences of host genetic differentiation and host ecology in determining infections in this diverse community of sympatric cichlid species.

TI Host use dynamics in a heterogeneous fitness landscape generates
   oscillations in host range and diversification
AB Colonization of novel hosts is thought to play an important role in parasite diversification, yet little consensus has been achieved about the macroevolutionary consequences of changes in host use. Here, we offer a mechanistic basis for the origins of parasite diversity by simulating lineages evolved in silico. We describe an individual-based model in which (i) parasites undergo sexual reproduction limited by genetic proximity, (ii) hosts are uniformly distributed along a one-dimensional resource gradient, and (iii) host use is determined by the interaction between the phenotype of the parasite and a heterogeneous fitness landscape. We found two main effects of host use on the evolution of a parasite lineage. First, the colonization of a novel host allowed parasites to explore new areas of the resource space, increasing phenotypic and genotypic variation. Second, hosts produced heterogeneity in the parasite fitness landscape, which led to reproductive isolation and therefore, speciation. As a validation of the model, we analyzed empirical data from Nymphalidae butterflies and their host plants. We then assessed the number of hosts used by parasite lineages and the diversity of resources they encompass. In both simulated and empirical systems, host diversity emerged as the main predictor of parasite species richness.

TI Genetic diversity, infection prevalence, and possible transmission
   routes of Bartonella spp. in vampire bats
AB Bartonella spp. are globally distributed bacteria that cause endocarditis in humans and domestic animals. Recent work has suggested bats as zoonotic reservoirs of some human Bartonella infections; however, the ecological and spatiotemporal patterns of infection in bats remain largely unknown. Here we studied the genetic diversity, prevalence of infection across seasons and years, individual risk factors, and possible transmission routes of Bartonella in populations of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in Peru and Belize, for which high infection prevalence has previously been reported. Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA gene for a subset of PCR-positive blood samples revealed sequences that were related to Bartonella described from vampire bats from Mexico, other Neotropical bat species, and streblid bat flies. Sequences associated with vampire bats clustered significantly by country but commonly spanned Central and South America, implying limited spatial structure. Stable and nonzero Bartonella prevalence between years supported endemic transmission in all sites. The odds of Bartonella infection for individual bats was unrelated to the intensity of bat flies ectoparasitism, but nearly all infected bats were infested, which precluded conclusive assessment of support for vector-borne transmission. While metagenomic sequencing found no strong evidence of Bartonella DNA in pooled bat saliva and fecal samples, we detected PCR positivity in individual saliva and feces, suggesting the potential for bacterial transmission through both direct contact (i.e., biting) and environmental (i.e., fecal) exposures. Further investigating the relative contributions of direct contact, environmental, and vector-borne transmission for bat Bartonella is an important next step to predict infection dynamics within bats and the risks of human and livestock exposures.

TI Reactive and pre-emptive vaccination strategies to control hepatitis E
   infection in emergency and refugee settings: A modelling study
AB Background
   Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is the leading cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Symptomatic infection is associated with case fatality rates of -20% in pregnant women and it is estimated to account for -10,000 annual pregnancy-related deaths in southern Asia alone. Recently, large and well-documented outbreaks with high mortality have occurred in displaced population camps in Sudan, Uganda and South Sudan. However, the epidemiology of HEV is poorly defined, and the value of different immunisation strategies in outbreak settings uncertain. We aimed to estimate the critical epidemiological parameters for HEV and to evaluate the potential impact of both reactive vaccination (initiated in response to an epidemic) and pre-emptive vaccination.
   Methods
   We analysed data from one of the world's largest recorded HEV epidemics, which occurred in internally-displaced persons camps in Uganda (2007-2009), using transmission dynamic models to estimate epidemiological parameters and assess the potential impact of reactive and pre-emptive vaccination strategies.
   Results
   Under baseline assumptions we estimated the basic reproduction number of HEV in three separate camps to range from 3.7 (95% Credible Interval [Crl] 2.8, 5.1) to 8.5 (5.3, 11.4). Mean latent and infectious periods were estimated to be 34 (95% Crl 28, 39) and 40 (95% Crl 23, 71) days respectively.
   Assuming 90% vaccine coverage, reactive two-dose vaccination of those aged 16-65 years excluding pregnant women (for whom vaccine is not licensed), if initiated after 50 reported cases, led to mean camp-specific reductions in mortality of 10 to 29%. Pre-emptive vaccination with two doses reduced mortality by 35 to 65%. Both strategies were more effective if coverage was extended to groups for whom the vaccine is not currently licensed. For example, two dose pre-emptive vaccination, if extended to include pregnant women, led to mean reductions in mortality of 66 to 82%.
   Conclusions
   HEV has a high transmission potential in displaced population settings. Substantial reductions in mortality through vaccination are expected, even if used reactively. There is potential for greater impact if vaccine safety and effectiveness can be established in pregnant women.

TI Improved methods to capture the total societal benefits of zoonotic
   disease control: Demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of an integrated
   control programme for Taenia solium, soil transmitted helminths and
   classical swine fever in northern Lao PDR
AB Background
   Control and elimination of zoonotic diseases requires robust information about their effect on both human and livestock health in order to enable policy formulation and the allocation of resources. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of controlling Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in both humans and pigs, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in humans by integrating their control to on-going human and animal health control programmes in northern Lao People's Democratic Republic.
   Method
   A cross-sectional study was carried out in 49 households, focusing on the prevalence of T. solium taenias/cysticercosis and soil transmitted helminths before and after a twelve month intervention. The village data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire through a door-to-door survey. The village data was then projected to the wider northern Lao PDR population using stochastic modelling and cost-effectiveness ratio (after aggregating the net cost to capture both human and animal health parameters) and GDP per capita as a threshold, to determine the cost-effectiveness of the integrated control of T. sollumtaeniasis/ cysticercosis and STH, assuming linear scaling out of the intervention. The zoonotic DALY (zDALY) approach was also used as an alternative method of estimating the cost-effectiveness ratio of controlling T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in humans and pigs.
   Findings
   Using cost-effectiveness analysis after aggregating the net cost and control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis alone as the base case, the study found that simultaneous control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in humans and pigs, STH in humans and Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in pigs was USD 14 per DALY averted and USD 234 per zDALY averted using zDALY method hence considered highly cost-effective whereas controlling T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis without incorporating STH and CSF was the least cost-effective (USD 3,672 per DALY averted). Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of controlling T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in people and pigs using zDALY as an alternative method was USD 3,662 per zDALY averted which was quite close to our findings using the aggregate net cost method.
   Conclusion
   The study showed that control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis alone in humans and pigs is not cost-effective in northern Lao PDR whereas control of STH is. Consequently, integrating T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis control with other cost-effective programmes such as STH and CSF markedly improved the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This is especially important in low resource countries where control of zoonotic neglected tropical diseases could be integrated with the human and animal health sectors to optimize use of the limited resources.

TI Health preparedness plan for dengue detection during the 2020 summer
   Olympic and Paralympic games in Tokyo
AB Background
   Participants in mass gathering events are at risk of acquiring imported and locally endemic infectious diseases. The 2014 dengue outbreak in Tokyo gathered attention since it was the first time in 70 years for Japan to experience an autochthonous transmission. Preparation for emerging infectious threats is essential even in places where these outbreaks have been largely unknown. The aim of this study is to identify strategies for early detection and prevention of dengue infection during the 2020 summer Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We modified and adapted the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) methodology, generally used in industrial manufacturing, to examine the current controls for dengue detection and assessment. Information on existing controls were obtained from publicly available resources. Our analysis revealed that the national infectious disease control system to detect dengue in Japan is robust. However, in the case of large assemblies of international visitors for special events when the spread of communicable and vector-borne diseases increases, there are three main gaps that could be reinforced. First, cyclical training or a certification program on tropical disease management is warranted for physicians, especially those working in non-infectious disease-designated hospitals or clinics. Second, multi-language communication methods need to be strengthened especially in the health and hospitality sector. Third, owners of accommodations should consider incorporating a formal tropical disease-training program for their staff members and have a contingency plan for infectious disease-suspected travelers.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our findings may facilitate physicians and public health officials where new controls would be beneficial for the 2020 summer Olympics and Paralympics. The FMEA framework has the potential to be applied to other infectious diseases, not just dengue.

TI Hendra Virus Spillover is a Bimodal System Driven by Climatic Factors
AB Understanding environmental factors driving spatiotemporal patterns of disease can improve risk mitigation strategies. Hendra virus (HeV), discovered in Australia in 1994, spills over from bats (Pteropus sp.) to horses and thence to humans. Below latitude -22 degrees, almost all spillover events to horses occur during winter, and above this latitude spillover is aseasonal. We generated a statistical model of environmental drivers of HeV spillover per month. The model reproduced the spatiotemporal pattern of spillover risk between 1994 and 2015. The model was generated with an ensemble of methods for presence-absence data (boosted regression trees, random forests and logistic regression). Presences were the locations of horse cases, and absences per spatial unit (2.7x2.7km pixels without spillover) were sampled with the horse census of Queensland and New South Wales. The most influential factors indicate that spillover is associated with both cold-dry and wet conditions. Bimodal responses to several variables suggest spillover involves two systems: one above and one below a latitudinal area close to -22 degrees. Northern spillovers are associated with cold-dry and wet conditions, and southern with cold-dry conditions. Biologically, these patterns could be driven by immune or behavioural changes in response to food shortage in bats and horse husbandry. Future research should look for differences in these traits between seasons in the two latitudinal regions. Based on the predicted risk patterns by latitude, we recommend enhanced preventive management for horses from March to November below latitude 22 degrees south.

TI Environmental Drivers of Ranavirus in Free-Living Amphibians in
   Constructed Ponds
AB Amphibian ranaviruses occur globally, but we are only beginning to understand mechanisms for emergence. Ranaviruses are aquatic pathogens which can cause>90% mortality in larvae of many aquatic-breeding amphibians, making them important focal host taxa. Host susceptibilities and virulence of ranaviruses have been studied extensively in controlled laboratory settings, but research is needed to identify drivers of infection in natural environments. Constructed ponds, essential components of wetland restoration, have been associated with higher ranavirus prevalence than natural ponds, posing a conundrum for conservation efforts, and emphasizing the need to understand potential drivers. In this study, we analyzed 4years of Frog virus 3 prevalence and associated environmental parameters in populations of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and green frogs (Lithobates clamitans) in a constructed pond system. High prevalence was best predicted by low temperature, high host density, low zooplankton concentrations, and Gosner stages approaching metamorphosis. This study identified important variables to measure in assessments of ranaviral infection risk in newly constructed ponds, including effects of zooplankton, which have not been previously quantified in natural settings. Examining factors mediating diseases in natural environments, particularly in managed conservation settings, is important to both validate laboratory findings in situ, and to inform future conservation planning, particularly in the context of adaptive management.

TI Using Parasitic Load to Measure the Effect of Anthropogenic Disturbance
   on Vervet Monkeys
AB Vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, thrive in urban areas of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and present a suitable model to assess parasitic load as a measure of anthropogenic disturbance, such as urbanization. We collected vervet monkey faecal samples from four study sites representing a gradient of land use and urbanization. We assessed faecal parasites using the faecal flotation method calculating eggs per gram and parasite richness. Overall, the more urban vervet monkey populations had a significantly higher parasite richness and abundance. Our study shows the applicability of using parasite load to measure the effect of urbanization on wildlife.

TI Indirect ecological effects interact with community genetic effects in a
   host - parasite system and dramatically reduce parasite burden
AB Community genetic (CG) effects and ecological factors create a complex set of interactions that are key drivers of evolutionary dynamics in ecological systems. To date, most studies investigating trait variation have focused on either effects of intraspecific genetic variation or on genotype by environment (GxE) interactions in isolation. Poorly investigated but very important are the interactions between CGs and indirect ecological effects (IEEs) that are caused by plant-soil interactions. Here, we tested how CGs in a cabbage host and its aphid parasite depended on the ecological conditions under which the host was grown. We established microcosms of different cabbage cultivars and aphid genotypes on soils inoculated with samples of other soils previously trained with onion. We hypothesized that such IEEs will have significantly different outcomes for ecosystems than predicted from simpler CG or GxE studies. Our analysis demonstrated a large IEE that differed by context and aphid genotype causing reduced parasite population sizes by up to 900. The IEE is induced by insect-repellent properties and the micro'time of the onion. Our results highlight the importance of interacting IEEs and CGs for ecosystems dynamics showing that IEEs offer sustainable solutions by dramatically reducing parasite burden on cash crops.

TI Determinants of Gammaherpesvirus Shedding in Saliva Among Ugandan
   Children and Their Mothers
AB Background. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are transmitted via saliva, but factors associated with salivary shedding are unknown.
   Methods. We measured the DNA load of both viruses in saliva specimens collected from approximately 500 Ugandan mothers and their 6-year-old children, testing all participants for EBV and KSHV-seropositive individuals for KSHV.
   Results. EBV and KSHV were shed by 72% and 22% of mothers, respectively, and by 85% and 40% of children, respectively; boys were more likely than girls to shed KSHV (48% vs 30%) but were equally likely to shed EBV. Children shed more KSHV and EBV than mothers, but salivary loads of EBV and KSHV were similar. KSHV shedding increased with increasing anti-KSHV (K8.1) antibodies in mothers and with decreasing antimalarial antibodies both in mothers and children. Among mothers, 40% of KSHV shedders also shed EBV, compared with 75% of KSHV nonshedders; among children, EBV was shed by 65% and 83%, respectively.
   Conclusions. In summary, in this population, individuals were more likely to shed EBV than KSHV in saliva. We identified several factors, including child's sex, that influence KSHV shedding, and we detected an inverse relationship between EBV and KSHV shedding, suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between the two viruses.

TI Cytophilic Antibodies Against Key Plasmodium falciparum Blood Stage
   Antigens Contribute to Protection Against Clinical Malaria in a High
   Transmission Region of Eastern India
AB Background. The collection of clinical data from a tribal population in a malaria-endemic area of India suggests the occurrence of naturally acquired immunity (NAI) against Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
   Methods. Quantity and functionality of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against intact merozoites and recombinant proteins were assessed in a 13-month longitudinal cohort study of 121 individuals, 3-60 years of age.
   Results. Opsonic phagocytosis of merozoites activity was strongly associated (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .18-.66; P = .0013) with protection against febrile malaria. Of the different IgG subclasses, only IgG3 antibodies against intact whole merozoites was significantly associated with protection against febrile malaria (HR = 0.47; 95% CI = .26-.86; P = .01). Furthermore, a combination of IgG3 antibody responses against Pf12, MSP3.7, MSP3.3, and MSP2(FC27) was strongly associated with protection against febrile malaria (HR = 0.15; 95% CI, .06-.37; P = .0001).
   Conclusions. These data suggest that NAI may, at least in part, be explained by opsonic phagocytosis of merozoites and IgG3 responses against whole merozoites, and in particular to a combination of 4 antigens is critical in this population. These results may have implications in the development of a subunit malaria vaccine.

TI Successful Infection of Tick Cell Cultures of Rhipicephalus sanguineus
   (Tropical Lineage) with Ehrlichia canis
AB There are two distinct lineages of ticks, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, in South America: tropical and temperate lineages. Only the tropical lineage is recognized as competent vector for Ehrlichia canis. The epidemiological data of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis is congruent with the distribution of the two lineages of R. sanguineus. Herein, we report the infection of R. sanguineus (tropical lineage) cell cultures with E. canis, after cryopreservation. R. sanguineus (tropical lineage) cell identity was confirmed by sequencing using a 16S rDNA gene fragment. Tick cell cultures were prepared in L-15B medium supplemented with 10%, 15%, and 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), and 10% of Tryptose Phosphate Broth (TPB). Cell cultures developed better at the concentration of 20% of FBS. Cultures in the fifth harvest (approximately 7 months later) were selected for the first infections. Optimal R. sanguineus cell growth and adhesion was observed (5.0x10(6) cells/mL, and the population doubling time every 57h). Once infected with E. canis, the cultures were maintained in L-15B medium supplemented with 2% and 5% of FBS fortified with iron and 10% TPB. Infected cells were also cryopreserved. DNA was extracted from infected and noninfected cells and analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR targeting the E. canis-dsb gene. Primary culture of the fifth passage was infected by E. canis and it maintained the pathogen for at least 40 days before partial cell destruction. Subcultures of infected cells (fresh and cryopreserved cultures) onto new tick cell cultures were successful. The E. canis infection was confirmed by real-time PCR and light and transmission electron microscopy. The R. sanguineus (tropical lineage) cells infected with E. canis successfully infected new tick cell cultures, showing that these cells could be an alternative substrate for maintenance of this pathogen.

TI The ecology of movement and behaviour: a saturated tripartite network
   for describing animal contacts
AB Ecologists regularly use animal contact networks to describe interactions underlying pathogen transmission, gene flow, and information transfer. However, empirical descriptions of contact often overlook some features of individual movement, and decisions about what kind of network to use in a particular setting are commonly ad hoc. Here, we relate individual movement trajectories to contact networks through a tripartite network model of individual, space, and time nodes. Most networks used in animal contact studies (e.g. individual association networks, home range overlap networks, and spatial networks) are simplifications of this tripartite model. The tripartite structure can incorporate a broad suite of alternative ecological metrics like home range sizes and patch occupancy patterns into inferences about contact network metrics such as modularity and degree distribution. We demonstrate the model's utility with two simulation studies using alternative forms of ecological data to constrain the tripartite network's structure and inform expectations about the harder-to-measure metrics related to contact.

TI Sampling considerations for a potential Zika virus urosurvey in New York
   City
AB In 2016, imported Zika virus (ZIKV) infections and the presence of a potentially competent mosquito vector (Aedes albopictus) implied that ZIKV transmission in New York City (NYC) was possible. The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene developed contingency plans for a urosurvey to rule out ongoing local transmission as quickly as possible if a locally acquired case of confirmed ZIKV infection was suspected. We identified tools to (1) rapidly estimate the population living in any given 150-m radius (i.e. within the typical flight distance of an Aedes mosquito) and (2) calculate the sample size needed to test and rule out the further local transmission. As we expected near-zero ZIKV prevalence, methods relying on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution were inappropriate. Instead, we assumed a hypergeometric distribution, 10 missed cases at maximum, a urine assay sensitivity of 92.6% and 100% specificity. Three suspected example risk areas were evaluated with estimated population sizes of 479-4,453, corresponding to a minimum of 133-1244 urine samples. This planning exercise improved our capacity for ruling out local transmission of an emerging infection in a dense, urban environment where all residents in a suspected risk area cannot be feasibly sampled.

TI Travel distance and human movement predict paths of emergence and
   spatial spread of chikungunya in Thailand
AB Human movement contributes to the probability that pathogens will be introduced to new geographic locations. Here we investigate the impact of human movement on the spatial spread of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Southern Thailand during a recent re-emergence. We hypothesised that human movement, population density, the presence of habitat conducive to vectors, rainfall and temperature affect the transmission of CHIKV and the spatio-temporal pattern of cases seen during the emergence. We fit metapopulation transmission models to CHIKV incidence data. The dates at which incidence in each of 151 districts in Southern Thailand exceeded specified thresholds were the target of model fits. We confronted multiple alternative models to determine which factors were most influential in the spatial spread. We considered multiple measures of spatial distance between districts and adjacency networks and also looked for evidence of long-distance translocation (LDT) events. The best fit model included driving-distance between districts, human movement, rubber plantation area and three LDT events. This work has important implications for predicting the spatial spread and targeting resources for control in future CHIKV emergences. Our modelling framework could also be adapted to other disease systems where population mobility may drive the spatial advance of outbreaks.

TI Host Dispersal Responses to Resource Supplementation Determine Pathogen
   Spread in Wildlife Metapopulations
AB Many wildlife species occupy landscapes that vary in the distribution, abundance, and quality of food resources. Increasingly, urbanized and agricultural habitats provide supplemental food resources that can have profound consequences for host distributions, movement patterns, and pathogen exposure. Understanding how host and pathogen dispersal across landscapes is affected by the spatial extent of food-supplemented habitats is therefore important for predicting the consequences for pathogen spread and impacts on host occupancy. Here we develop a generalizable metapopulation model to understand how the relative abundance of provisioned habitats across the landscape and how the host dispersal responses to provisioning and infection influence patch occupancy by hosts and their pathogens. We find that pathogen invasion and landscape-level infection prevalence are greatest when provisioning increases patch attractiveness and disperser production and when infection has minimal costs on dispersal success. Alternatively, if provisioning promotes site fidelity or reduces disperser production, increasing the fraction of food-supplemented habitats can reduce landscape-scale infection prevalence and minimize disease-induced declines in host occupancy. This work highlights the importance of considering how resources and infection jointly influence host dispersal for predicting how changing resource distributions influence the spread of infectious diseases.

   Pneumonia
AB The characteristics and risk factors of pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) infection in humans are poorly known. We performed virological, pathological, and epidemiological analyses of a Dutch case, and compared the results with those of a US case. Both infections occurred in transplant patients under immunosuppressive therapy and caused fatal respiratory failure. Both virus isolates clustered with PPMV-1, which has pigeons and doves as reservoir. Experimentally inoculated pigeons became infected and transmitted the virus to naive pigeons. Both patients were likely infected by contact with infected pigeons or doves. Given the large populations of feral pigeons with PPMV-1 infection in cities, increasing urbanization, and a higher proportion of immunocompromised individuals, the risk of severe human PPMV-1 infections may increase. We recommend testing for avian paramyxovirus type 1, including PPMV-1, in respiratory disease cases where common respiratory pathogens cannot be identified.

TI Novel Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis via Neurapheresis Therapy
AB Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) has emerged as the most common life-threatening fungal meningitis worldwide. Current management involves a sequential, longitudinal regimen of antifungals; despite a significant improvement in survival compared with uniform mortality without treatment, this drug paradigm has not led to a consistent cure. Neurapheresis therapy, extracorporeal filtration of yeasts from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in infected hosts, is presented here as a novel, one-time therapy for CM. In vitro filtration of CSF through this platform yielded a 5-log reduction in concentration of the yeast and a 1-log reduction in its polysaccharide antigen over 24 hours. Additionally, an analogous closed-loop system achieved 97% clearance of yeasts from the subarachnoid space in a rabbit model over 4-6 hours. This is the first publication demonstrating the direct ability to rapidly clear, both in vitro and in vivo, the otherwise slowly removed fungal pathogen that directly contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in CM.

TI Assessment of ultra-sensitive malaria diagnosis versus standard
   molecular diagnostics for malaria elimination: an in-depth molecular
   community cross-sectional study
AB Background Submicroscopic malaria infections contribute to transmission in exposed populations but their extent is underestimated even by standard molecular diagnostics. Sophisticated sampling and ultra-sensitive molecular methods can maximise test sensitivity but are not feasible in routine surveillance. Here we investigate the gains achievable by using increasingly sensitive methods with the aim to understand what diagnostic sensitivity is necessary to guide malaria interventions.
   Methods Venous blood samples were collected from participants in a cross-sectional survey in two coastal medium-endemic villages in Madang province, Papua New Guinea. Using ultra-sensitive quantitative PCR (us-qPCR) on concentrated high-volume blood samples (2 mL) as reference, we quantified the proportion of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections and gametocyte carriers detectable in fingerprick blood volumes (200 mu L) by standard 18S rRNA qPCR, us-qPCR, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and ultra-sensitive P falciparum RDT. We further compared the epidemiological patterns observed with each diagnostic approach in the study population.
   Findings Venous blood samples were collected from 300 participants between Dec 5, 2016, and Feb 24, 2017 (ie, during peak rainy season). Standard qPCR identified 87 (54%) of 161 P falciparum infections and 73 (52%) of 141 P vivax infections detected by the reference method. us-qPCR identified an additional 11 (7%) P falciparum infections and 14 (10%) P vivax infections. 80 (86%) of 93 P falciparum gametocyte carriers and 75 (91%) of 82 P vivax gametocyte carriers were found among infections detectable by us-qPCR. Ultra-sensitive RDT missed half of P falciparum infections detected by standard qPCR, including high gametocytaemic infections. Epidemiological patterns corresponded well between standard qPCR and the reference method. As the prevalence of P vivax decreased with increasing age, the proportion of P vivax infections undetectable by standard qPCR increased.
   Interpretation Almost all potentially transmitting parasite carriers were identified with us-qPCR on fingerprick blood volumes. Analysing larger blood volumes revealed a large pool of ultra-low-density P falciparum and P vivax infections, which are unlikely to be transmitted. Therefore, current RDTs cannot replace molecular diagnostics for identifying potential P falciparum transmitters. Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Foliar pathogens are unlikely to stabilize coexistence of competing
   species in a California grassland
AB Pathogen infection is common in wild plants and animals, and may regulate their populations. If pathogens have narrow host ranges and increase with the density of their favored hosts, they may promote host species diversity by suppressing common species to the benefit of rare species. Yet, because many pathogens infect multiple co-occurring hosts, they may not strongly respond to the relative abundance of a single host species. Are natural communities dominated by specialized pathogens that respond to the relative abundance of a specific host or by pathogens with broad host ranges and limited responses to the relative abundance of single host? The answer determines the potential for pathogens to promote host coexistence, as often hypothesized, or to have negligible or even negative effects on host coexistence. We lack a systematic understanding of the impacts, identities, and host ranges of pathogens in natural communities. Here we characterize a community of foliar fungal pathogens and evaluate their host specificity and fitness impacts in a California grassland community of native and exotic species. We found that most of the commonly isolated fungal pathogens were multi-host, with intermediate to low specialization. The amount of pathogen damage each host experienced was independent of host species local relative abundance. Despite pathogen sharing among the host species, fungal communities slightly differed in composition across host species. Plants with high pathogen damage tended to have lower seed production but the relationship was weak, suggesting limited fitness impacts. Moreover, seed production was not dependent on the local relative abundance of each plant species, suggesting that stabilizing coexistence mechanisms may operate at larger spatial scales in this community. Because foliar pathogens in this grassland community are multi-host and have small fitness impacts, they are unlikely to promote negative frequency dependence or plant species coexistence in this system. Still, given that pathogen community composition differentiates across host species, some more subtle feedbacks between host relative abundance and pathogen community composition, damage, and fitness impacts are possible, which could, in turn, promote either coexistence or competitive exclusion.

TI Seasonal shifts in the insect gut microbiome are concurrent with changes
   in cold tolerance and immunity
AB 1. Seasonal changes in the environment, such as varying temperature, have the potential to change the functional relationship between ectothermic animals, such as insects, and their microbiomes. Our objectives were to determine: (a) whether seasonal changes in temperature shift the composition of the insect gut microbiome, and (b) whether changes in the microbiome are concomitant with changes in the physiology of the host, including the immune system and response to cold.
   2. We exposed laboratory populations of the spring field cricket, Gryllus veletis (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), to simulated overwintering conditions in both a laboratory microcosm and a field-like microcosm containing soil and leaves. In summer, autumn, winter and spring, we extracted and sequenced 16S bacterial genomic DNA from cricket guts, to capture seasonal variation in the composition of the microbiome.
   3. The composition of the gut microbiome was similar between microcosms, and overall highly anaerobic. In both microcosms, we captured similar seasonal variation in the composition of the microbiome, where overwintering resulted in permanent changes to these microbial communities. In particular, the abundance of Pseudomonas spp. decreased, and that of Wolbachia spp. increased, during overwintering.
   4. Concurrent with overwintering changes in the gut microbiome, G.veletis acquire freeze tolerance and immune function shifts temporarily, returning to summer levels of activity in the spring. In a specific manner, haemocyte concentrations increase but survival of fungal infection decreases in the winter, whereas the ability to clear bacteria from the haemolymph remains unchanged.
   5. Overall, we demonstrate that the gut microbiome does shift seasonally, and in concert with other physiological changes. We hypothesize that these changes may be linked, and suggest that it will next be important to determine whether these changes in the microbiome contribute to host overwintering success.

AB Measuring contemporary dispersal in highly mobile terrestrial species is challenging, especially when species are characterized by low levels of population differentiation. Directly transmitted viruses can be used as a surrogate for traditional methods of tracking host movement. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a species-specific lentivirus, which has an exceptionally high mutation rate and circulates naturally in wild felids. Using samples derived from 35 lion (Panthera leo) prides, we tested the prediction that FIV in lions (FIVPle) can be used to track the dispersal of individuals between prides. As FIVPle subtypes are geographically structured throughout Africa, we predicted that this marker could be used to detect phylogeographic structure of lions at smaller spatial scales. Phylogenetic analyses of FIV(Ple)pol-RT sequences showed that core pride members (females and subadults) shared evolutionary close viral lineages which differed from neighbouring core prides, whereas sequences from sexually mature males associated with the same pride were always the most divergent. In six instances, natal pride associations of divergent male lions could be inferred, on the assumption that FIVPle infections are acquired during early life stages. Congruence between the genetic pattern of FIV and pride structure suggests that vertical transmission plays an important role in lion FIV dynamics. At a fine spatial scale, significant viral geographic structuring was also detected between lions occurring north of the Olifants River within the Kruger National Park (KNP) and those occupying the southern and central regions. This pattern was further supported by phylogenetic analyses and the confinement of FIVPle subtype E to the northern region of KNP. The study provides new insights into the use of retroviral sequences to predict host dispersal and fine-scale contemporary geographic structure in a social felid species.

TI Evidence for convergent evolution of host parasitic manipulation in
   response to environmental conditions
AB Environmental conditions exert strong selection on animal behavior. We tested the hypothesis that the altered behavior of hosts due to parasitic manipulation is also subject to selection imposed by changes in environmental conditions over time. Our model system is ants manipulated by parasitic fungi to bite onto vegetation. We analyzed the correlation between forest type (tropical vs. temperate) and the substrate where the host bites (biting substrate: leaf vs. twigs), the time required for the fungi to reach reproductive maturity, and the phylogenetic relationship among specimens from tropical and temperate forests from different parts of the globe. We show that fungal development in temperate forests is longer than the period of time leaves are present and the ants are manipulated to bite twigs. When biting twigs, 90% of the dead ants we examined had their legs wrapped around twigs, which appears to provide better attachment to the plant. Ancestral state character reconstruction suggests that leaf biting is the ancestral trait and that twig biting is a convergent trait in temperate regions of the globe. These three lines of evidence suggest that changes in environmental conditions have shaped the manipulative behavior of the host by its parasite.

TI Participatory survey of Rift Valley fever in nomadic pastoral
   communities of North-central Nigeria: The associated risk pathways and
   factors
AB Background
   Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging neglected mosquito-borne viral zoonotic disease of domestic animals and humans, with potential for global expansion. The objectives of this study were: to assess perceived relative burden and seasonality of RVF in nomadic cattle herds and validate the burden with sero-prevalence impact; and assess perceived risk factors associated with the disease and risk pathways for RVF virus in nomadic pastoral herds of North-central Nigeria using pastoralists' existing veterinary knowledge.
   Methods
   Participatory Epidemiology (PE) survey was conducted in Fulani nomadic pastoral communities domiciled in Niger State between January and December 2015. A cross-sectional sero-prevalence investigation was also carried out in nomadic pastoral cattle herds to validate outcomes of PE. A total of nine nomadic pastoral communities were purposively selected for qualitative impact assessment using Participatory Rural Appraisal tools, while 97 cattle randomly sampled from 15 purposively selected nomadic herds and had their sera analyzed using c-ELISA. Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance W statistics and OpenEpi 2.3.1 were used for statistical analyses.
   Results
   Mean proportional piles (relative burden) of RVF (Gabi-gabi(F)) was 8.3%, and nomads agreement on the burden was strong (W = 0.6855) and statistically significant (P<0.001). This was validated by 11.3% (11/97; 95% CI: 6.1-18.9) sero-positivity (quantitative impact). Mean matrix scores of prominent clinical signs associated with RVF were fever (3.1), anorexia (2.1), abortion (4.1), nasal discharge (3.3), neurological disorder (8.4), diarrhoea (3.2), and sudden death (4.4), with strong agreement (W = 0.6687) and statistically significant (p<0.001). Mean proportional piles of pastoralists' perceived risk factors identified to influenced RVF occurrence were: availability of mosquitoes (18 piles, 17.6%), high cattle density (16 piles, 15.9%) and high rainfall (12 piles, 12.2%). Agreement on the risk factors was strong (W = 0.8372) and statistically significant (p<0.01). Mean matrix scores for the Entry pathway of RVF virus into the nomadic pastoral herds were: presence of RVFV infected mosquitoes (tiny biting flies) (7.9), presence of infected cattle in herds (8.4), and contacts of herd with infected wild animals at grazing (10.1). Mean matrix scores for the Spread pathway of RVF virus in herds were bites of infected mosquitoes (5.1), contacts with infected aborted fetuses/fluids (7.8), and contaminated pasture with aborted fetuses/fluids (9.7). Agreement on risk pathways was strong (W = 0.6922) and statistically significant (p<0.03). Key informants scored RVF to occurred more in Damina or late rainy season (5.3), followed by Kaka or early dry season (3.3), with strong agreement (W = 0.8719) and statistically significant (P<0.01). This study highlighted the significant existing knowledge level about RVF contained in nomadic pastoralists.
   Conclusions
   The use of PE approach is needful in active surveillance of livestock diseases in pastoral communities domiciled in highly remote areas. RVF surveillance system, control and prevention programmes that take the identified risk factors and pathways into consideration will be beneficial to the livestock industry in Nigeria, and indeed Africa. An 'OneHealth' approach is needed to improve efficiency of RVF research, surveillance, prevention and control systems, so as to assure food security and public health in developing countries.

TI Risk factors for HTLV-1 infection in Central Africa: A rural
   population-based survey in Gabon
AB Background
   Human T-Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human oncoretrovirus that infects at least 5 to 10 million people worldwide and is associated with severe diseases. Africa appears as the largest HTLV-1 endemic area. However, the risk factors for the acquisition of HTLV-1 remain poorly understood in Central Africa.
   Methods
   We conducted an epidemiological survey between 2013 and 2017, in rural areas of 6 provinces of Gabon, in a rainforest environment. Epidemiological data were obtained and blood samples were collected after informed consent. Plasma were screened for HTLV-1 antibodies by ELISA and the positive samples were then tested by Western blot (WB). Genomic DNA derived from buffy-coat was subjected to two semi-nested PCRs amplifying either HTLV-1 envgene or LTR region fragments.
   Results
   We recruited 2,060 individuals over 15 years old, including 1,205 men and 855 women (mean age: 49 years). Of these, 299 were found to be ELISA HTLV-1/2 seropositive. According to WB criteria, 136 were HTLV-1 (6.6%), 25 HTLV-1/2 (1.2%) and 9 HTLV seroreactive (0.4%). PCR results showed that 146 individuals were positive for at least one PCR: 104 for the env gene and 131 for the LTR region. Based on both serological and molecular results, 179 individuals were considered infected with HTLV-1, leading to an overall prevalence of 8.7%. The distribution of HTLV-1 infection was heterogeneous across the country. Based on multivariable analyses, female gender, increasing age, ethnicity (Pygmy) and multiple hospitalizations (more than 5 times) were found to be independent risk factors for HTLV-1 infection. Furthermore, a non-human primate bite appeared to be marginally associated with a higher risk of HTLV-1 infection.
   Conclusion
   Based on state-of-the-art serological and molecular methods, we have demonstrated that rural adult populations in Gabon are highly endemic for HTLV-1. Our results regarding risk factors should lead to public health actions aiming to reduce HTLV-1 transmission.

TI Development of reverse genetics systems and investigation of host
   response antagonism and reassortment potential for Cache Valley and
   Kairi viruses, two emerging orthobunyaviruses of the Americas
AB Orthobunyaviruses such as Cache Valley virus (CVV) and Kairi virus (KRIV) are important animal pathogens. Periodic outbreaks of CVV have resulted in the significant loss of lambs on North American farms, whilst KRIV has mainly been detected in South and Central America with little overlap in geographical range. Vaccines or treatments for these viruses are unavailable. One approach to develop novel vaccine candidates is based on the use of reverse genetics to produce attenuated viruses that elicit immune responses but cannot revert to full virulence. The full genomes of both viruses were sequenced to obtain up to date genome sequence information. Following sequencing, minigenome systems and reverse genetics systems for both CVV and KRIV were developed. Both CVV and KRIV showed a wide in vitro cell host range, with BHK-21 cells a suitable host cell line for virus propagation and titration. To develop attenuated viruses, the open reading frames of the NSs proteins were disrupted. The recombinant viruses with no NSs protein expression induced the production of type I interferon (IFN), indicating that for both viruses NSs functions as an IFN antagonist and that such attenuated viruses could form the basis for attenuated viral vaccines. To assess the potential for reassortment between CVV and KRIV, which could be relevant during vaccination campaigns in areas of overlap, we attempted to produce M segment reassortants by reverse genetics. We were unable to obtain such viruses, suggesting that it is an unlikely event.

TI Inter- and intra-host sequence diversity reveal the emergence of viral
   variants during an overwintering epidemic caused by dengue virus
   serotype 2 in southern Taiwan
AB Purifying selection during dengue viral infection has been suggested as the driving force of viral evolution and the higher complexity of the intra-host quasi-species is thought to offer an adaptive advantage for arboviruses as they cycle between arthropod and vertebrate hosts. However, very few studies have been performed to investigate the viral genetic changes within (intra-host) and between (inter-host) humans in a spatio-temporal scale. Viruses of different serotypes from various countries imported to Taiwan cause annual outbreaks. During 2001-2003, two consecutive outbreaks were caused by dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and resulted in a larger-scale epidemic with more severe dengue cases in the following year. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the viruses from both events were similar and related to the 2001 DENV-2 isolate from the Philippines. We comprehensively analyzed viral sequences from representative dengue patients and identified three consensus genetic variants, group la, lb and II, with different spatio-temporal population dynamics. The phylodynamic analysis suggested group lb variants, characterized by lower genetic diversity, transmission rate, and intra-host variant numbers, might play the role of maintenance variants. The residential locations among the patients infected by group lb variants were in the outer rim of case clusters throughout the 2001-2003 period whereas group la and II variants were located in the centers of case clusters, suggesting that group lb viruses might serve as "sheltered overwintering" variants in an undefined ecological niche. Further deep sequencing of the viral envelope (E) gene directly from individual patient serum samples confirmed the emergence of variants belonging to three quasi-species (group la, lb, and II) and the ancestral role of the viral variants in the latter phase of the 2001 outbreak contributed to the later, larger-scale epidemic beginning in 2002. These findings enhanced our understanding of increasing epidemic severity over time in the same epidemic area. It also highlights the importance of combining phylodynamic and deep sequencing analysis as surveillance tools for detecting dynamic changes in viral variants, particularly searching for and monitoring any specific viral subpopulation. Such subpopulations might have selection advantages in both fitness and transmissibility leading to increased epidemic severity.

TI Quantifying the value of surveillance data for improving model
   predictions of lymphatic filariasis elimination
AB Background
   Mathematical models are increasingly being used to evaluate strategies aiming to achieve the control or elimination of parasitic diseases. Recently, owing to growing realization that process-oriented models are useful for ecological forecasts only if the biological processes are well defined, attention has focused on data assimilation as a means to improve the predictive performance of these models.
   Methodology and principal findings
   We report on the development of an analytical framework to quantify the relative values of various longitudinal infection surveillance data collected in field sites undergoing mass drug administrations (MDAs) for calibrating three lymphatic filariasis (LF) models (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, and TRANSFIL), and for improving their predictions of the required durations of drug interventions to achieve parasite elimination in endemic populations. The relative information contribution of site-specific data collected at the time points proposed by the WHO monitoring framework was evaluated using model-data updating procedures, and via calculations of the Shannon information index and weighted variances from the probability distributions of the estimated timelines to parasite extinction made by each model. Results show that data-informed models provided more precise forecasts of elimination timelines in each site compared to model-only simulations. Data streams that included year 5 post-MDA microfilariae (mf) survey data, however, reduced each model's uncertainty most compared to data streams containing only baseline and/or post-MDA 3 or longer-term mf survey data irrespective of MDA coverage, suggesting that data up to this monitoring point may be optimal for informing the present LF models. We show that the improvements observed in the predictive performance of the best data-informed models may be a function of temporal changes in inter-parameter interactions. Such best data-informed models may also produce more accurate predictions of the durations of drug interventions required to achieve parasite elimination.
   Significance
   Knowledge of relative information contributions of model only versus data-informed models is valuable for improving the usefulness of LF model predictions in management decision making, learning system dynamics, and for supporting the design of parasite monitoring programmes. The present results further pinpoint the crucial need for longitudinal infection surveillance data for enhancing the precision and accuracy of model predictions of the intervention durations required to achieve parasite elimination in an endemic location.

TI Vector competence of Aedes bromeliae and Aedes vitattus mosquito
   populations from Kenya for chikungunya virus
AB Background
   Kenya has experienced outbreaks of chikungunya in the past years with the most recent outbreak occurring in Mandera in the northern region in May 2016 and in Mombasa in the coastal region from November 2017 to February 2018. Despite the outbreaks in Kenya, studies on vector competence have only been conducted on Aedes aegypti. However, the role played by other mosquito species in transmission and maintenance of the virus in endemic areas remains unclear. This study sought to determine the possible role of rural Aedes bromeliae and Aedes vittatus in the transmission of chikungunya virus, focusing on Kilifi and West Pokot regions of Kenya.
   Methods
   Four day old female mosquitoes were orally fed on chikungunya virus-infected blood at a dilution of 1:1 of the viral isolate and blood (10(6.4) plaque-forming units [PFU]/ml) using artificial membrane feeder (Hemotek system) for 45 minutes. The engorged mosquitoes were picked and incubated at 29-30 degrees C ambient temperature and 70-80% humidity in the insectary. At days 5, 7 and 10 post-infection, the mosquitoes were carefully dissected to separate the legs and wings from the body and their proboscis individually inserted in the capillary tube containing minimum essential media (MEM) to collect salivary expectorate. The resultant homogenates and the salivary expectorates were tested by plaque assay to determine virus infection, dissemination and transmission potential of the mosquitoes.
   Results
   A total of 515 female mosquitoes (311 Ae. bromeliae and 204 Ae. vittatus) were exposed to the East/Central/South Africa (ECSA) lineage of chikungunya virus. Aedes vittatus showed high susceptibility to the virus ranging between 75-90% and moderate dissemination and transmission rates ranging from 35-50%. Aedes bromeliae had moderate susceptibility ranging between 26-40% with moderate dissemination and transmission rates ranging from 27-55%.
   Conclusion
   This study demonstrates that both Ae. vittatus and Ae. bromeliae populations from West Pokot and Kilifi counties in Kenya are competent vectors of chikungunya virus. Based on these results, the two areas are at risk of virus transmission in the event of an outbreak. This study underscores the need to institute vector competence studies for populations of potential vector species as a means of evaluating risk of transmission of the emerging and reemerging arboviruses in diverse regions of Kenya.

TI Uncovering vector, parasite, blood meal and microbiome patterns from
   mixed-DNA specimens of the Chagas disease vector Triatoma dimidiata
AB Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted by >140 triatomine species across the Americas. In Central America, the main vector is Triatoma dimidiata, an opportunistic blood meal feeder inhabiting both domestic and sylvatic ecotopes. Given the diversity of interacting biological agents involved in the epidemiology of Chagas disease, having simultaneous information on the dynamics of the parasite, vector, the gut micro biome of the vector, and the blood meal source would facilitate identifying key biotic factors associated with the risk of T. cruzi transmission. In this study, we developed a RADseq-based analysis pipeline to study mixed-species DNA extracted from T. dimidiata abdomens. To evaluate the efficacy of the method across spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design that spanned from individual villages within Guatemala to major biogeographic regions of Central America. Information from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatics tools and used to evaluate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and predominant Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in the region, the population genetic structure of T. dimidiata, gut microbial diversity, and the blood meal history. An average of 3.25 million reads per specimen were obtained, with approximately 1% assigned to the parasite, 20% to the vector, 11% to bacteria, and 4% to putative blood meals. Using a total of 6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we detected nine infected vectors harboring two distinct DTUs: Tcl and a second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector specimens were sufficiently variable for population genomic analyses, with a total of 25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs across all samples that were sufficient to detect geographic genetic structure at both local and regional scales. We observed a diverse microbiotic community, with significantly higher bacterial species richness in infected T. dimidiata abdomens than those that were not infected. Unifrac analysis suggests a common assemblage of bacteria associated with infection, which co-occurs with the typical gut microbial community derived from the local environment. We identified vertebrate blood meals from five T. dimidiata abdomens, including chicken, dog, duck and human; however, additional detection methods would be necessary to confidently identify blood meal sources from most specimens. Overall, our study shows this method is effective for simultaneously generating genetic data on vectors and their associated parasites, along with ecological information on feeding patterns and microbial interactions that may be followed up with complementary approaches such as PCR-based parasite detection, 18S eukaryotic and 16S bacterial barcoding.

TI Distinct monocyte subset phenotypes in patients with different clinical
   forms of chronic Chagas disease and seronegative dilated cardiomyopathy
AB Background
   Chronic infection with Trypanosoma cruzi leads to a constant stimulation of the host immune system. Monocytes, which are recruited in response to inflammatory signals, are divided into classical CD14(hi)CD16(-), non-classical CD14(lo)CD16(+) and intermediate CD14(hi)CD16(+) subsets. In this study, we evaluated the frequencies of monocyte subsets in the different clinical stages of chronic Chagas disease in comparison with the monocyte profile of seronegative heart failure subjects and seronegative healthy controls. The effect of the anti parasite drug therapy benznidazole on monocyte subsets was also explored.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   The frequencies of the different monocyte subsets and their phenotypes were measured by flow cytometry. Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies were quantified by conventional serological tests. T. cruzi-infected subjects with mild or no signs of cardiac disease and patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy unrelated to T. cruzi infection showed increased levels of non-classical CD14(lo)CD16(+) monocytes compared with healthy controls. In contrast, the monocyte profile in T. cruzi-infected subjects with severe cardiomyopathy was skewed towards the classical and intermediate subsets. After benznidazole treatment, non-classical monocytes CD14(lo)CD16(+) decreased while classical monocytes CD14(hi)CD16(-) increased.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The different clinical stages of chronic Chagas disease display distinct monocyte profiles that are restored after anti-parasite drug therapy. T. cruzi-infected subjects with severe cardiac disease displayed a profile of monocytes subsets suggestive of a more pronounced inflammatory environment compared with subjects suffering from heart failure not related to T. cruzi infection, supporting that parasite persistence might also alter cell components of the innate immune system.

TI Epidemiological characterization of incident cases of Rickettsia
   infection in rural areas of Uraba region, Colombia
AB Introduction
   Most of the studies related to rickettsial infection in Colombia are cross-sectional because of the challenge in conducting prospective studies on infectious disease that may have a difficult diagnosis. Although cross-sectional studies are essential to detect people exposed to rickettsiae, they are not suited to demonstrate the recent circulation of this pathogen in areas at risk of transmission.
   Objective
   To characterize the epidemiology of incident cases of Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsial infection in humans and equines from rural areas of Uraba region in Colombia where outbreaks of rickettsiae previously occurred.
   Materials and methods
   A prospective study was conducted in the Alto de Mulatos and Las Changas in the Uraba region. Serum samples and socio-ecological information were collected from 597 people enrolled in 2015, and a second sample was collected from 273 people a year later. Indirect immune-fluorescence assays for detection of IgG antibody against rickettsiae were done using slides with Rickettsia rickettsii antigens. A titer >= 128 was considered positive. Incident cases were defined as (i) serological conversion of IgG titers from seronegative to seropositive or (ii) at least a four-fold increase in IgG end point titers in the second sample.
   Results
   The cumulative incidence of rickettsial infection was 6.23% (95%CI 3.67-9.78) in humans and 32.31% (21/65) of incident cases in equines. Incident cases were mostly females (82.35%), the median age of cases was 41.02 years (IQR 18.62-54.1), and 29.41% reported tick bites during the study period. Results from multivariate analysis showed that removal of ticks after working outdoors is a protective factor for rickettsial infection (RR 0.26, 95%CI 0.08-0.84) and that a higher incidence of infection occurred in people who reported fever in the last year (RR 4.26, 95%CI 1.15-9.31).
   Conclusions
   These results showed recent circulation of SFG rickettsiae in areas where previous lethal outbreaks have been reported, supporting the implementation of preventive measures to halt rickettsial transmission in the studied communities.

TI Development of an urban molecular xenomonitoring system for lymphatic
   filariasis in the Recife Metropolitan Region, Brazil
AB Introduction
   Molecular xenomonitoring (MX) pathogen detection in the mosquito rather than human is a promising tool for lymphatic filariasis (LF) surveillance. In the Recife Metropolitan Region (RMR), the last LF focus in Brazil, Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes have been implicated in transmitting Wuchereria bancrofti parasites. This paper presents findings on the ideal mosquito collection method, mosquito dispersion, W. bancrofti infection in mosquitoes and W. bancrofti antigen in humans to aid MX development.
   Methods
   Experiments occurred within two densely populated urban areas of Olinda, RMR, in July and August 2015. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps were compared to battery-powered aspirators as collection methods, and mosquito dispersion was measured by mosquito mark release recapture (MMRR). Female Cx. quinquefasciatus were tested by PCR for W. bancrofti infection, and study area residents were screened by rapid tests for W. bancrofti antigen.
   Results
   Aspirators caught 2.6 times more total Cx. quinquefasciatus, including 38 times more blood fed and 5 times more gravid stages, than CDC light traps. They also collected 123 times more Aedes aegypti. Of the 9,644 marked mosquitoes released, only ten (0.01%) were recaptured, nine of which were < 50m (34.8m median, 85.4m maximum) from the release point. Of 9,169 unmarked mosquitoes captured in the MMR, 38.3% were unfed, 48.8% blood-fed, 5.5% semi-gravid, and 7.3% gravid. PCR on 182 pools (1,556 mosquitoes) found no evidence of W. bancrofti infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus. Rapid tests on 110 of 111 eligible residents were all negative for W. bancrofti antigen.
   Conclusions
   Aspirators were more effective than CDC light traps at capturing Ae. aegyptiand all but unfed stages of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Female Cx. quinquefasciatus traveled short (< 86m) distances in this urban area. Lack of evidence for W. bancrofti infection in mosquitoes and antigen in humans in these fine-scale studies does not indicate that LF transmission has ceased in the RMR. A MX surveillance system should consider vector-specific collection methods, mosquito dispersion, and spatial scale but also local context, environmental factors such as sanitation, and host factors such as infection prevalence and treatment history.

TI Genetic diversity in two Plasmodium vivax protein ligands for
   reticulocyte invasion
AB The interaction between Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) and Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) has been described as critical for the invasion of human reticulocytes, although increasing reports of P. vivax infections in Duffy-negative individuals questions its unique role. To investigate the genetic diversity of the two main protein ligands for reticulocyte invasion, PvDBP and P. vivax Erythrocyte Binding Protein (PvEBP), we analyzed 458 isolates collected in Cambodia and Madagascar from individuals genotyped as Duffy-positive. First, we observed a high proportion of isolates with multiple copies PvEBP from Madagascar (56%) where Duffy negative and positive individuals coexist compared to Cambodia (19%) where Duffy-negative population is virtually absent. Whether the gene amplification observed is responsible for alternate invasion pathways remains to be tested. Second, we found that the PvEBP gene was less diverse than PvDBP gene (12 vs. 33 alleles) but provided evidence for an excess of nonsynonymous mutations with the complete absence of synonymous mutations. This finding reveals that PvEBP is under strong diversifying selection, and confirms the importance of this protein ligand in the invasion process of the human reticulocytes and as a target of acquired immunity. These observations highlight how genomic changes in parasite ligands improve the fitness of P. vivax isolates in the face of immune pressure and receptor polymorphisms.

TI Population genetic analysis of Chadian Guinea worms reveals that human
   and non-human hosts share common parasite populations
AB Following almost 10 years of no reported cases, Guinea worm disease (GWD or dracunculiasis) reemerged in Chad in 2010 with peculiar epidemiological patterns and unprecedented prevalence of infection among non-human hosts, particularly domestic dogs. Since 2014, animal infections with Guinea worms have also been observed in the other three countries with endemic transmission (Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan), causing concern and generating interest in the parasites' true taxonomic identity and population genetics. We present the first extensive population genetic data for Guinea worm, investigating mitochondrial and microsatellite variation in adult female worms from both human and non-human hosts in the four endemic countries to elucidate the origins of Chad's current outbreak and possible host-specific differences between parasites. Genetic diversity of Chadian Guinea worms was considerably higher than that of the other three countries, even after controlling for sample size through rarefaction, and demographic analyses are consistent with a large, stable parasite population. Genealogical analyses eliminate the other three countries as possible sources of parasite reintroduction into Chad, and sequence divergence and distribution of genetic variation provide no evidence that parasites in human and non-human hosts are separate species or maintain isolated transmission cycles. Both among and within countries, geographic origin appears to have more influence on parasite population structure than host species. Guinea worm infection in non-human hosts has been occasionally reported throughout the history of the disease, particularly when elimination programs appear to be reaching their end goals. However, no previous reports have evaluated molecular support of the parasite species identity. Our data confirm that Guinea worms collected from non-human hosts in the remaining endemic countries of Africa are Dracunculus medinensis and that the same population of worms infects both humans and dogs in Chad. Our genetic data and the epidemiological evidence suggest that transmission in the Chadian context is currently being maintained by canine hosts.

TI A simian-adenovirus-vectored rabies vaccine suitable for
   thermostabilisation and clinical development for low-cost single-dose
   pre-exposure prophylaxis
AB Background
   Estimates of current global rabies mortality range from 26,000 to 59,000 deaths per annum. Although pre-exposure prophylaxis using inactivated rabies virus vaccines (IRVs) is effective, it requires two to three doses and is regarded as being too expensive and impractical for inclusion in routine childhood immunization programmes.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Here we report the development of a simian-adenovirus-vectored rabies vaccine intended to enable cost-effective population-wide pre-exposure prophylaxis against rabies. ChAdOx2 RabG uses the chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 (AdC68) backbone previously shown to achieve pre-exposure protection against rabies in non-human primates. ChAdOx2 differs from AdC68 in that it contains the human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) E4 orf6/7 region in place of the AdC68 equivalents, enhancing ease of manufacturing in cell lines which provide AdHu5 E1 proteins in trans.
   We show that immunogenicity of ChAdOx2 RabG in mice is comparable to that of AdC68 RabG and other adenovirus serotypes expressing rabies virus glycoprotein. High titers of rabies virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) are elicited after a single dose. The relationship between levels of VNA activity and rabies virus glycoprotein monomer-binding antibody differs after immunization with adenovirus-vectored vaccines and IRV vaccines, suggesting routes to further enhancement of the efficacy of the adenovirus-vectored candidates. We also demonstrate that ChAdOx2 RabG can be thermostabilised using a low-cost method suitable for clinical bio-manufacture and ambient-temperature distribution in tropical climates. Finally, we show that a dose-sparing effect can be achieved by formulating ChAdOx2 RabG with a simple chemical adjuvant. This approach could lower the cost of ChAdOx2 RabG and other adenovirus-vectored vaccines.
   Conclusions/Significance
   ChAdOx2 RabG may prove to be a useful tool to reduce the human rabies death toll. We have secured funding for Good Manufacturing Practice- compliant bio-manufacture and Phase I clinical trial of this candidate.

TI Spatial heterogeneity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is driven
   by environmental factors and rodent community composition
AB Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease caused mainly by two hantaviruses in China: Hantaan virus and Seoul virus. Environmental factors can significantly affect the risk of contracting hantavirus infections, primarily through their effects on rodent population dynamics and human-rodent contact. We aimed to clarify the environmental risk factors favoring rodent-to-human transmission to provide scientific evidence for developing effective HFRS prevention and control strategies. The 10-year (2006-2015) field surveillance data from the rodent hosts for hantavirus, the epidemiological and environmental data extracted from satellite images and meteorological stations, rodent-to-human transmission rates and impacts of the environment on rodent community composition were used to quantify the relationships among environmental factors, rodent species and HFRS occurrence. The study included 709 cases of HFRS. Rodent species in Chenzhou, a hantavirus hotspot, comprise mainly Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, R. flavipectus and some other species (R. losea and Microtus fortis calamorum). The rodent species played different roles across the various land types we examined, but all of them were associated with transmission risks. Some species were associated with HFRS occurrence risk in forest and water bodies. R. norvegicus and R. flavipectus were associated with risk of HFRS incidence in grassland, whereas M. musculus and R. flavipectus were associated with this risk in built-on land. The rodent community composition was also associated with environmental variability. The predictive risk models based on these significant factors were validated by a good-fit model, where: cultivated land was predicted to represent the highest risk for HFRS incidence, which accords with the statistics for HFRS cases in 2014-2015. The spatial heterogeneity of HFRS disease may be influenced by rodent community composition, which is associated with local environmental conditions. Therefore, future work should focus on preventing HFRS is moist, warm environments.

TI Exploring the impact of inoculum dose on host immunity and morbidity to
   inform model-based vaccine design
AB Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.

TI Comparative demography elucidates the longevity of parasitic and
   symbiotic relationships
AB Parasitic and symbiotic relationships govern vast nutrient and energy flows, yet controversy surrounds their longevity. Enduring relationships may engender parallel phylogenies among hosts and parasites, but so may ephemeral relationships when parasites colonize related hosts. An understanding of whether symbiont and host populations have grown and contracted in concert would be useful when considering the temporal durability of these relationships. Here, we devised methods to compare demographic histories derived from genomic data. We compared the historical growth of the agent of severe human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, and its mosquito vector, Anopheles gambiae, to human and primate histories, thereby discerning long-term parallels and anthropogenic population explosions. The growth history of Trichinella spiralis, a zoonotic parasite disseminated by swine, proved regionally specific, paralleling distinctive growth histories for wild boar in Asia and Europe. Parallel histories were inferred for an anemone and its algal symbiont (Exaiptasia pallida and Symbiodinium minutum). Concerted growth in potatoes and the agent of potato blight (Solanum tuberosum and Phytophthora infestans) did not commence until the age of potato domestication. Through these examples, we illustrate the utility of comparative historical demography as a new exploratory tool by which to interrogate the origins and durability of myriad ecological relationships. To facilitate future use of this approach, we introduce a tool called C-PSMC to align and evaluate the similarity of demographic history curves.

TI Carrying a selfish genetic element predicts increased migration
   propensity in free-living wild house mice
AB Life is built on cooperation between genes, which makes it vulnerable to parasitism. Selfish genetic elements that exploit this cooperation can achieve large fitness gains by increasing their transmission relative to the rest of the genome. This leads to counter-adaptations that generate unique selection pressures on the selfish genetic element. This arms race is similar to host-parasite coevolution, as some multi-host parasites alter the host's behaviour to increase the chance of transmission to the next host. Here, we ask if, similarly to these parasites, a selfish genetic element in house mice, the t haplotype, also manipulates host behaviour, specifically the host's migration propensity. Variants of the t that manipulate migration propensity could increase in fitness in a meta-population. We show that juvenile mice carrying the t haplotype were more likely to emigrate from and were more often found as migrants within a long-term free-living house mouse population. This result may have applied relevance as the t has been proposed as a basis for artificial gene drive systems for use in population control.

TI Vaccine-Associated Maintenance of Epithelial Integrity Correlated With
   Protection Against Virus Entry
AB To identify the mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) might penetrate the epithelial barrier during sexual transmission to women and the mechanisms of vaccine-associated protection against entry, we characterized early epithelial responses to vaginal inoculation of simian immunodeficiency virus strain mac251 (SIVmac251) in naive or SIVmac239 Delta nef-vaccinated rhesus macaques. Vaginal inoculation induced an early stress response in the cervicovaginal epithelium, which was associated with impaired epithelial integrity, damaged barrier function, and virus and bacterial translocation. In vaccinated animals, early stress responses were suppressed, and the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity correlated with prevention of virus entry. These vaccine-protective effects were associated with a previously described mucosal system for locally producing and concentrating trimeric gp41 antibodies at the mucosal interface and with formation of SIV-specific immune complexes that block the stress responses via binding to the epithelial receptor FCGR2B and subsequent inhibitory signaling. Thus, blocking virus entry may be one protective mechanism by which locally concentrated non-neutralizing Ab might prevent HIV sexual transmission to women.

TI Murine Renal Transcriptome Profiles Upon Leptospiral Infection:
   Implications for Chronic Kidney Diseases
AB Background. Leptospirosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp leads to kidney damage that may progress to chronic kidney disease. However, how leptospiral infections induced renal damage is unclear.
   Methods. We apply microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies to investigate the first murine transcriptome-wide, leptospires-mediated changes in renal gene expression to identify biological pathways associated with kidney damage.
   Results. Leptospiral genes were detected in renal transcriptomes of mice infected with Leptospira interrogans at day 28 postinfection, suggesting colonization of leptospires within the kidney with propensity of chronicity. Comparative differential gene expression and pathway analysis were investigated in renal transcriptomes of mice infected with pathogens and nonpathogens. Pathways analysis showed that Toll-like receptor signaling, complements activation, T-helper 1 type immune response, and T cell-mediated immunity/chemotaxis/proliferation were strongly associated with progressive tubulointerstitial damage caused by pathogenic leptospiral infection. In addition, 26 genes related with complement system, immune function, and cell-cell interactions were found to be significantly up-regulated in the L interrogans-infected renal transcriptome.
   Conclusions. Our results provided comprehensive knowledge regarding the host transcriptional response to leptospiral infection in murine kidneys, particularly the involvement of cell-to-cell interaction in the immune response. It would provide valuable resources to explore functional studies of chronic renal damage caused by leptospiral infection.

TI Migratory monarchs that encounter resident monarchs show life-history
   differences and higher rates of parasite infection
AB Environmental change induces some wildlife populations to shift from migratory to resident behaviours. Newly formed resident populations could influence the health and behaviour of remaining migrants. We investigated migrant-resident interactions among monarch butterflies and consequences for life history and parasitism. Eastern North American monarchs migrate annually to Mexico, but some now breed year-round on exotic milkweed in the southern US and experience high infection prevalence of protozoan parasites. Using stable isotopes (delta H-2, delta C-13) and cardenolide profiles to estimate natal origins, we show that migrant and resident monarchs overlap during fall and spring migration. Migrants at sites with residents were 13 times more likely to have infections and three times more likely to be reproductive (outside normal breeding season) compared to other migrants. Exotic milkweed might either attract migrants that are already infected or reproductive, or alternatively, induce these states. Increased migrant-resident interactions could affect monarch parasitism, migratory success and long-term conservation.

TI Inbreeding shapes tuberculosis progression in female adult badgers
   (Meles meles)
AB In Focus: Beton, C. H., Delahay, R. J., Smith, F. A. P., Robertson, A., McDonald, R. A., Young, A. J., Burke T. A., & Hodgson, D. (2018). Inbreeding intensifies sex- and age-dependent disease in a wild mammal. Journal of Animal Ecology, 87, 1497-1499. Increasing crossbreeding of relatives promotes inbreeding which, in turn, can cause a reduction in fitness and the emergence of a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression. Benton etal., used the badger (Meles meles)Mycobacterium bovis model system to study the relationship between inbreeding, disease, ageing and sex. A link between multilocus homozygosity (general effect) and TB progression (measured as antibody response to infection) and between homozygosity at specific loci (local effect) and TB progression were established in this study, highlighting the importance of host genetic background in determining host disease outcomes, and thus on shaping disease dynamics in wild populations. Moreover, the authors demonstrated for the first time in a natural population that this positive association might be modulated by sex and age. In infected individuals, inbreeding only affects disease progression in adult females.

TI Disentangling the drivers of invasion spread in a vector-borne tree
   disease
AB Pine wilt disease (PWD) invaded southern Japan in the early 1900s and has gradually expanded its range to northern Honshu (Japanese mainland). The disease is caused by a pathogenic North American nematode, which is transmitted by native pine sawyer beetles. Recently, the disease has invaded other portions of East Asia and Europe where extensive mortality of host pines is anticipated to resemble historical patterns seen in Japan. There is a critical need to identify the main drivers of PWD invasion spread so as to predict the future spread and evaluate containment strategies in newly invaded world regions. But the coupling of pathogen and vector population dynamics introduces considerable complexity that is important for understanding this and other plant disease invasions. In this study, we analysed historical (1980-2011) records of PWD infection and vector abundance, which were spatially extensive but recorded at coarse categorical levels (none, low and high) across 403 municipalities in northern Honshu. We employed a multistate occupancy model that accounted both for demographic stochasticity and observation errors in categorical data. Analysis revealed that sparse sawyer populations had lower probabilities of transition to high abundance than did more abundant populations even when regional abundance stayed the same, suggesting the existence of positive density dependence, that is an Allee effect, in sawyer dynamics. Climatic conditions (average accumulated degree days) substantially limited invasion spread in northern regions, but this climatic influence on sawyer dynamics was generally weaker than the Allee effect. Our results suggest that tactics (eg sanitation logging of infected pines) which strengthen Allee effects in sawyer dynamics may be effective strategies for slowing the spread of PWD.

TI Transmission risk predicts avoidance of infected conspecifics in
   Trinidadian guppies
AB Associating with conspecifics afflicted with infectious diseases increases the risk of becoming infected, but engaging in avoidance behaviour incurs the cost of lost social benefits. Across systems, infected individuals vary in the transmission risk they pose, so natural selection should favour risk-sensitive avoidance behaviour that optimally balances the costs and benefits of sociality. Here, we use the guppy Poecilia reticulata-Gyrodactylus turnbulli host-parasite system to test the prediction that individuals avoid infected conspecifics in proportion to the transmission risk they pose. In dichotomous choice tests, uninfected fish avoided both the chemical and visual cues, presented separately, of infected conspecifics only in the later stages of infection. A transmission experiment indicated that this avoidance behaviour accurately tracked transmission risk (quantified as both the speed at which transmission occurs and the number of parasites transmitting) through the course of infection. Together, these findings reveal that uninfected hosts can use redundant cues across sensory systems to inform dynamic risk-sensitive avoidance behaviour. This correlation between the transmission risk posed by infected individuals and the avoidance response they elicit has implications for the evolutionary ecology of infectious disease, and its explicit inclusion may improve the ability of epidemic models to predict disease spread.

TI Combined bottom-up and top-down pressures drive catastrophic population
   declines of Arctic skuas in Scotland
AB Understanding drivers of population change is critical for effective species conservation. In the northeast Atlantic Ocean, recent changes amongst seabird communities are linked to human and climate change impacts on food webs. Many species have declined severely, with food shortages, and increased predation reducing productivity. Arctic skua Stercorarius parasiticus, a kleptoparasite of other seabirds, is one such species. The aim of the study was to determine relative effects of bottom-up and top-down pressures on Arctic skuas across multiple colonies in a rapidly declining national population. Long-term monitoring data were used to quantify changes in population size and productivity of Arctic skuas, their hosts (black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, common guillemot Uria aalge, Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica, Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea) and an apex predator (great skua Stercorarius skua) over 24years (1992-2015) in Scotland. We used digital mapping and statistical models to determine relative effects of bottom-up (host productivity) and top-down (great skua density) pressures on Arctic skuas across 33 colonies, and assess variation between three colony types classified by host abundance. Arctic skuas declined by 81% and their hosts by 42%-92%, whereas at most colonies great skuas increased. Annual productivity declined in Arctic skuas and their hosts, and reduced Arctic skua breeding success was a driver of the species' population decline. Arctic skua productivity was positively associated with annual breeding success of hosts and negatively with great skua density. Intercolony variation suggested Arctic skua trends and productivity were most sensitive to top-down pressures at smaller colonies of host species where great skuas had increased most, whereas bottom-up pressures dominated at large colonies of host species. Scotland's Arctic skua population is declining rapidly, with bottom-up and top-down pressures simultaneously reducing breeding success to unsustainably low levels. Marine food web alterations, strongly influenced by fisheries management and climate change, are driving the decline, and this study demonstrates severe vulnerability of seabirds to rapid change in human-modified ecosystems. Potential but untested conservation solutions for Arctic skuas include marine protected areas, supplementary feeding within colonies and management of great skuas.

TI Seven decades of mountain hare counts show severe declines where
   high-yield recreational game bird hunting is practised
AB 1. Recreational hunting is widespread and can benefit nature conservation when well-practised, monitored, and regulated. Management for recreational red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica shooting on upland heathland in the UK causes conservation conflict because the intensive habitat, predator, and disease management needed to maintain high-grouse densities for "driven" shooting has detrimental environmental impacts, notably for raptor populations.
   2. Sustainable management of mountain hares Lepus timidus scoticus, a game species in the same landscapes, poses a challenge. Control of transmission to grouse of a viral disease, louping-ill, for which mountain hares are a host, has become an additional motivation to kill mountain hares since research during 1993-2001 suggested that culls might reduce infection rates in grouse.
   3. We analysed population trends of mountain hares from spring counts on moorland managed for grouse shooting and on contiguous alpine land. On moorland sites, a long-term decline (4.6% per annum) from 1954 to 1999 increased to 30.7% per annum from then until 2017, with a density index falling to <1% of initial levels after 2008. Before 1999, declines were associated with conifer planting and were least severe where heather burning characteristic of grouse management was present. Grouse moors had the highest rate of decline after 1999.
   4. On alpine sites, the density index increased by 2.0% per annum from 1954 to 2007, then declined by 12.3% per annum but remained within the previous range of variation.
   5. Despite lack of evidence that it increases grouse numbers, reduction of louping-ill transmission to grouse became a more frequent justification for mountain hare culls at a time consistent with it causing these recent, rapid mountain hare declines on grouse moors.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Long-term field counts suggest that intensification of game bird management has resulted in severe, recent declines in mountain hare numbers, exacerbating longer term declines associated with land-use change. Management practices founded on misinterpretation of earlier research are the probable cause. Regulation of hare culling would provide a framework for formal tests of whether culls affect grouse surpluses. It would also provide an opportunity to examine mountain hare populations' resilience to culls of varying size and seasonal timing.

TI Applying a Bayesian weighted surveillance approach to detect chronic
   wasting disease in white-tailed deer
AB 1. Surveillance is critical for early detection of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Weighted surveillance leverages heterogeneity in infection risk to increase sampling efficiency.
   2. Here, we apply a Bayesian approach to estimate weights for 16 surveillance classes of white-tailed deer in Wisconsin, USA, relative to hunter-harvested yearling males. We used these weights to conduct a surveillance programme for detecting chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer at Shenandoah National Park (SHEN) in Virginia, USA.
   3. Generally, for surveillance, risk of infection increased with age and was greater in males. Clinical suspect deer had the highest risk, with weight estimates of 33.33 and 9.09 for community-reported and hunter-reported suspect deer, respectively. Fawns had the lowest risk with an estimated weight of 0.001.
   4. We used surveillance weights for Wisconsin deer to determine sampling effort required to detect a CWD-positive case in SHEN if prevalence in yearling males >= 0.025. The sampling required to detect CWD was 37-91 adult deer, depending on the adult male: female ratio in the surveillance stream. We collected rectal biopsies from 49 female and 21 male adult deer, and 10 additional samples from vehicle-killed deer. CWD was not detected and we concluded with 95% probability that prevalence in the reference population (yearling males) was between 0.0% and 3.6%.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our approach allows managers to estimate relative surveillance weights for different host classes and quantify limits of disease detection in real time when only a sample of animals from a population can be tested, resulting in considerable cost savings for agencies performing wildlife disease detection surveillance. Additionally, it provides a rigorous means of estimating prevalence limits when a disease/pathogen is not detected in a sample set. It is therefore applicable to other wildlife, domestic animal and human disease systems, which can be characterized by surveillance classes with heterogeneous probability of infection. This methodology is also extendable to other disciplines such as invasive species, environmental toxicology, and generally, any ecological question seeking to efficiently use scarce financial and human resources to maximize the detection probability of a rare event.

TI Previous exposure to myxoma virus reduces survival of European rabbits
   during outbreaks of rabbit haemorrhagic disease
AB 1. Exploiting synergies among diseases or parasites could increase the efficacy of biological control of invasive species. In Australia, two viruses were introduced to control European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus: myxoma virus in 1950 and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus in 1995. While these biological controls caused initial declines of >95% in affected populations, and despite recurring outbreaks of both diseases, rabbits remain a problem in many areas.
   2. We used 18 years of capture-mark-recapture, dead recovery, and antibody assay data from a sentinel population in South Australia to test whether these two diseases interact to modify the survival of individual wild rabbits. We compared four joint, multistate, dead-recovery models to test the hypotheses that rabbit haemorrhagic disease and myxoma viruses have synergistic (i.e., previous exposure to one virus affects survival during outbreaks of the other virus) or additive effects (i.e., previous exposure to one virus does not affect survival during outbreaks of the other virus).
   3. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease outbreaks reduced the survival of individuals with no immunity by more than half during the 58-day capture-trip intervals, i.e., from 0.86-0.90 to 0.37-0.48. Myxomatosis outbreaks had a smaller effect, reducing survival to 0.74-0.82; however, myxomatosis outbreaks were more prolonged, spanning more than twice as many trips.
   4. There was considerable information-theoretic support (wAIC(c) = 0.69) for the model in which exposure to myxomatosis affected survival during rabbit haemorrhagic disease outbreaks. Rabbits previously exposed to myxoma virus had lower survival during rabbit haemorrhagic disease outbreaks than rabbits never exposed to either virus. There was negligible support for the model in which previous exposure to rabbit haemorrhagic disease affected survival in myxomatosis outbreaks (wAIC(c) < 0.01).
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that biological control agents can have a greater impact than single-pathogen challenge studies might suggest. Introducing additional biological control agents might therefore increase the mortality of rabbits beyond the additive effects of individual biological controls. Furthermore, our results show that by understanding and exploiting disease synergies, managers could increase the efficacy of biological controls for other invasive animals.

TI The roles of migratory and resident birds in local avian influenza
   infection dynamics
AB 1. Migratory birds are an increasing focus of interest when it comes to infection dynamics and the spread of avian influenza viruses (AIV). However, we lack detailed understanding of migratory birds' contribution to local AIV prevalence levels and their downstream socio-economic costs and threats.
   2. To explain the potential differential roles of migratory and resident birds in local AIV infection dynamics, we used a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. We investigated five (mutually non- exclusive) mechanisms potentially driving observed prevalence patterns: (1) a pronounced birth pulse (e.g. the synchronised annual influx of immunologically naive individuals), (2) short-term immunity, (3) increase in susceptible migrants, (4) differential susceptibility to infection (i.e. transmission rate) for migrants and residents, and (5) replacement of migrants during peak migration.
   3. SIR models describing all possible combinations of the five mechanisms were fitted to individual AIV infection data from a detailed longitudinal surveillance study in the partially migratory mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos). During autumn and winter, the local resident mallard community also held migratory mallards that exhibited distinct AIV infection dynamics.
   4. Replacement of migratory birds during peak migration in autumn was found to be the most important mechanism driving the variation in local AIV infection patterns. This suggests that a constant influx of migratory birds, likely immunological naive to locally circulating AIV strains, is required to predict the observed temporal prevalence patterns and the distinct differences in prevalence between residents and migrants.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis reveals a key mechanism that could explain the amplifying role of migratory birds in local avian influenza virus infection dynamics; the constant flow and replacement of migratory birds during peak migration. Apart from monitoring efforts, in order to achieve adequate disease management and control in wildlife-with knock-on effects for livestock and humans,-we conclude that it is crucial, in future surveillance studies, to record host demographical parameters such as population density, timing of birth and turnover of migrants.

TI Pathogen dynamics under both bottom-up host resistance and top-down
   hyperparasite attack
AB 1. The relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down control of population dynamics has been the focus of much debate. In infectious disease biology, research is typically focused on the bottom-up process of host resistance, wherein the direction of control flows from the lower to the higher trophic level to impact on pathogen population size and epidemiology. However, the importance of top-down control by a pathogen's natural enemies has been mostly overlooked.
   2. Here, we explore the effects of, and interaction between, host genotype (i.e., genetic susceptibility to pathogen infection) and infection by a hyperparasitic fungus, Ampelomyces spp., on the establishment and early epidemic growth and transmission of a powdery mildew plant pathogen (Podosphaera plantaginis). We used a semi-natural field experiment to contrast the impacts of hyperparasite infection, host-plant resistance and spatial structure to reveal the key factors that determine pathogen spread. We then used a laboratory-based inoculation approach to test whether the field experiment results hold across multiple pathogen-host genetic combinations and to explore hyperparasite effects on the pathogen's later life-history stages.
   3. We found that hyperparasite infection had a negligible effect on within-host infection development and between-host spread of the pathogen during the onset of epidemics. In contrast, host-plant resistance was the major determinant of whether plants became infected, and host genotype and proximity to an infection source determined infection severity.
   4. Our laboratory study showed that, while the interaction between host and pathogen genotypes was the key determinant of infection outcome, hyperparasitism did, on average, reduce the severity of infection. Moreover, hyperparasite infection negatively influenced the production of the pathogen's overwintering structures.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that bottom-up host resistance affects pathogen spread, but top-down control of powdery mildew pathogens is likely more effective against later life-history stages. Further, while hyperparasitism in this system can reduce early pathogen growth under stable laboratory conditions, this effect is not detectable in a semi-natural environment. Considering the effects of hyperparasites at multiple points in pathogen's life history will be important when considering hyperparasite-derived biocontrol measures in other natural and agricultural systems.

TI Periodic, Parasite-Mediated Selection For and Against Sex
AB Asexual lineages should rapidly replace sexual populations. Why sex then? The Red Queen hypothesis proposes that parasite-mediated selection against common host genotypes could counteract the per capita birth rate advantage of asexuals. Under the Red Queen hypothesis, fluctuations in parasite-mediated selection can drive fluctuations in the asexual population, leading to the coexistence of sexual and asexual reproduction. Does shifting selection by parasites drive fluctuations in the fitness and frequency of asexuals in nature? Combining long-term field data with mesocosm experiments, we detected a shift in the direction of parasite selection in the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and its coevolving parasite, Microphallus sp. In the early 2000s, asexuals were more infected than sexuals. A decade later, the asexuals had declined in frequency and were less infected than sexuals. Over time, the mean infection prevalence of asexuals equaled that of sexuals but varied far more. This variation in asexual infection prevalence suggests the potential for parasite-mediated fluctuations in asexual fitness. Accordingly, we detected fitness consequences of the shift in parasite selection: when they were less infected than sexuals, asexuals increased in frequency in the field and in paired mesocosms that isolated the effect of parasites. The match between field and experiment argues that coevolving parasites drive temporal change in the relative fitness and frequency of asexuals, potentially promoting the coexistence of reproductive modes in P. antipodarum.

TI Genetic Diversity Among Candida albicans Isolated from Humans and Cattle
   with Respiratory Distress in Egypt
AB As human populaces develop, they are progressively squeezed into higher living densities. The same is true for horticulture and animals expected to bolster these communities. Despite the high potential for zoonotic transmission, connections among humans and cattle have been understudied; however, Candida albicans remains the most important medical mycosis. The genesis of the mycobiome can vary, and interactions between humans and cattle are progressively being perceived as a key interface for disease transmission. INT1 is a unique gene from Candida albicans; hence, it has been used for detection as well as intraspecific and interspecific phylogenetic analysis of C. albicans collected from human patients and cattle with pulmonary distress in urban-rural populations. A total of 1,921 specimens were examined by direct microscopy and culture to recover yeast associated with human infection. Identification was performed by micromorphology using an API 20C AUX system. The fungal species identified in bovine nasal specimens were Alternaria species (15%), Penicillium species, and C. albicans (6.7%). Other fungal species, such as Aspergillus niger, Torulopsis species, Mucor species (5%), Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium species, Trichosporon species (3.3%), C. rugosa, C. tropical, and Saccharomyces species (1.7%), were also isolated. In human sputum specimens, C. albicans (20%) and C. parapsilosis (2.7%) were the only reported yeast species in our samples. The four identified C. albicans species (two human and two cattle) were subjected to INT1 gene sequence analysis, which confirmed major phylogenetic relationships among human and cattle isolates. This finding highlights the public health importance of bovines as a potential source for C. albicans zoonotic transmission to humans in an urban-rural community. Additionally, the close relationship between circulating C. albicans strains recorded in Egypt and the United States indicates the possible cross-species transmission of C. albicans between imported foreign and native cattle breeds.

TI Effects of Rickettsia amblyommatis Infection on the Vector Competence of
   Amblyomma americanum Ticks for Rickettsia rickettsii
AB Although Dermacentor spp. ticks are considered the primary vectors of Rickettsia rickettsii in the United States, other North American tick species are also capable of transmitting the agent, including the lone star tickAmblyomma americanum. The lone star tick is an aggressive human-biting tick abundant in the South, Central, and Mid-Atlantic United States, which has been shown to be a competent vector of R. rickettsii in laboratory studies. However in nature, A. americanum frequently carry Rickettsia amblyommatisanother member of the spotted fever groupwith the prevalence of infection reaching 84% in some populations. It has been postulated that the presence of an endosymbiotic Rickettsia in a significant proportion of a vector population would diminish or even block transmission of pathogenic Rickettsia in ticks from generation to generation due to transovarial interference. We measured the ability of R. amblyommatis-infected A. americanum to acquire R. rickettsii from an infected host with a bloodmeal, and transmit it transstadially, horizontally (to a susceptible host), and vertically to the next generation. Larvae from both the R. amblyommatis-infected and R. amblyommatis-free cohorts acquired R. rickettsii from infected guinea pigs, but the presence of the symbiont diminished the ability of coinfected engorged larvae to transmit R. rickettsii transstadially. Conversely, acquisition of R. rickettsii by cofeeding was unaffected in R. amblyommatis-infected nymphs and adults; prevalence of R. rickettsii in engorged adults reached 97% in both R. amblyommatis-infected and R. amblyommatis-free cohorts. In guinea pigs exposed to dually infected nymphs, R. rickettsii infection was milder than in those fed upon nymphs infected with R. rickettsii only. The frequency of transovarial transmission of R. rickettsii in the R. amblyommatis-infected cohort (31%) appeared lower than that in the R. amblyommatis-free cohort (48%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Larval progenies of dually infected A. americanum females transmitted R. rickettsii to naive guinea pigs confirming viability of the pathogen. Thus, the vector competence of A. americanum for R. rickettsii was not significantly affected by R. amblyommatis.

Seven flea species (Chaetopsylla globiceps, Pulex irritans, Archaeopsylla erinacei, Chaetopsylla rothschildi, Chaetopsylla trichosa, Ctenocephalides canis, and Ctenopthalmus assimilis) and three species of hard ticks (Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes hexagonus, Haemaphysalis concinna) were recorded on sampled animals. Consequently, the DNA of five different pathogen taxa was confirmed in collected arthropod vectors: Bartonella spp. (in P. irritans, Ch. globiceps, and Ct. assimilis), Rickettsia spp. (in A. erinacei, I. ricinus, I. hexagonus, and H. concinna), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (in I. ricinus), Theileria sp. (in Ch. globiceps and H. concinna), and Hepatozoon canis (in I. ricinus and I. hexagonus). Mycoplasma spp., Dipylidium caninum, and Acanthocheilonema reconditum were not found in fleas or ticks in this study.

TI Q Fever in Rural Australia: Education Versus Vaccination
AB Background: Q fever is an infection caused by Coxiella burnetii, a zoonotic disease acquired from both wild and domestic animals. Northern rural New South Wales (NSW) communities in Australia have an increased risk of exposure to this organism. Both the acute and chronic phases of the infection are associated with significant morbidity, which is often increased by delayed recognition and treatment. Recent termination of vaccination programs in Australia may increase the risk of infection in these populations. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated the current knowledge base and overall understanding of clinicians on the epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of Q fever in the Northern New South Wales Local Health District. Results: Forty-five participants responded to the survey. Among those, 35 participants (78%) were hospital based and 10 (22%) were from doctors working in the community. Thirty-one (72%) clinicians answered bacteria as the cause of Q fever, 34 (79.1%) participants selected animals as the reservoir of Q fever infection, and 22 (51%) identified inhalation as the form of transmission. The majority identified livestock rearing occupations (84%) as a high-risk group; however, only 65-70% identified stock yard and meat workers as groups also at risk. Furthermore, 23 (51%) of the participants considered those living in rural and remote communities as high risk. Conclusions: Our results identified gaps in knowledge of clinicians in the epidemiology and diagnosis of acute Q fever infection. With the termination of vaccination programs, this study highlights the need for education programs that can increase Q fever awareness toward prompt identification and treatment.

TI Community-wide consequences of sexual dimorphism: evidence from nectar
   microbes in dioecious plants
AB Intraspecific trait variation is receiving renewed interest as a factor affecting the structure of multi-species communities within and across trophic levels. One pervasive form of intraspecific trait variation is sexual dimorphism in animals and plants, which might exert large effects particularly on the communities of host-associated organisms, but the extent of these effects is not well understood. We investigated whether host-associated microbial communities developed differently in the floral nectar of female and male individuals of the dioecious shrubs, Eurya emarginata and E. japonica. We found that nectar-colonizing microbes such as bacteria and fungi were more than twice as prevalent and, overall, more than 10 times as abundant in male flowers as in female flowers. Microbial species composition also differed between flower sexes. To examine potential mechanisms behind these differences, we manipulated the frequency of flower visitation by animals and the order of arrival of microbial species to nectar. Animal visitation frequency affected microbial communities more greatly in male flowers, while arrival order affected them more in female flowers. These sex-specific effects appeared attributable to differences in how animals and microbes altered the chemical characteristics of nectar that limited microbial growth. Taken together, our results provide evidence that sexual dimorphism can have large effects on the structure of host-associated communities.

TI Disease where you dine: plant species and floral traits associated with
   pathogen transmission in bumble bees
AB Hotspots of disease transmission can strongly influence pathogen spread. Bee pathogens may be transmitted via shared floral use, but the role of plant species and floral trait variation in shaping transmission dynamics is almost entirely unexplored. Given the importance of pathogens for the decline of several bee species, understanding whether and how plant species and floral traits affect transmission could give us important tools for predicting which plant species may be hotspots for disease spread. We assessed variation in transmission via susceptibility (probability of infection) and mean intensity (cell count of infected bees) of the trypanosomatid gut pathogen Crithidia bombi to uninfected Bombus impatiens workers foraging on 14 plant species, and assessed the role of floral traits, bee size and foraging behavior on transmission. We also conducted a manipulative experiment to determine how the number of open flowers affected transmission on three plant species, Penstemon digitalis, Monarda didyma, and Lythrum salicaria. Plant species differed fourfold in the overall mean abundance of Crithidia in foraging bumble bees (mean including infected and uninfected bees). Across plant species, bee susceptibility and mean intensity increased with the number of reproductive structures per inflorescence (buds, flowers and fruits); smaller bees and those that foraged longer were also more susceptible. Trait-based models were as good or better than species-based models at predicting susceptibility and mean intensity based on AIC values. Surprisingly, floral size and morphology did not significantly predict transmission across species. In the manipulative experiment, more open flowers increased mean pathogen abundance fourfold in Monarda, but had no effect in the other two plant species. Our results suggest that variation among plant species, through their influence on pathogen transmission, may shape bee disease dynamics. Given widespread investment in pollinator-friendly plantings to support pollinators, understanding how plant species affect disease transmission is important for recommending plant species that optimize pollinator health.

TI Resolving the paradox of clumped seed dispersal: positive density and
   distance dependence in a bat-dispersed species
AB One of the hypothesized benefits of seed dispersal is to escape density- and distance-responsive, host-specific, natural enemies near maternal plants where conspecific seed and seedling densities are high. Such high conspecific neighbor densities typically result in lower offspring growth and survival (i.e., negative density-dependent effects), yet many dispersal modes result in clumped seed distributions. New World leaf-nosed bats transport fruits to their feeding roosts and deposit seeds, thereby creating high-density seed/seedling patches beneath feeding roosts in heterospecific trees away from maternal trees, which seemingly nullifies a key benefit of seed dispersal. Such dispersal may still be adaptive if negative density-dependent effects are reduced under feeding roosts or if the benefit of being dispersed away from maternal trees outweighs negative effects of conspecific seed/seedling density below roosts. We mapped the entire post-germination population of a bat-dispersed tree species Calophyllum longifolium (Calophyllaceae) in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama in each of three successive years. We tested two hypotheses: (1) distance-dependent effects are stronger than density-dependent effects on seedling performance because seedlings far from conspecific adults are more likely to escape natural enemies even when at high densities and (2) negative density-dependent effects will be reduced far from vs. near conspecific adults. Density and distance were naturally decoupled, as expected. However, in contrast to our expectation, we found positive density effects on seedling survival and density-dependent effects did not differ with distance from conspecific adults. Both density and distance had positive effects on seedling survival when considered together, while only year had a significant effect on seedling growth. Thus, both being dispersed under bat feeding roosts and escaping the vicinity of conspecific adults were beneficial for C. longifolium seedling survival, supporting the directed dispersal and escape hypotheses, respectively. Despite resulting in high densities of conspecific seedlings, favorable habitat under bat feeding roosts and lack of negative density-dependent effects appear to provide evolutionary advantages in C. longifolium.

TI Landscape structure and ecology influence the spread of a bat fungal
   disease
AB White-nose syndrome (WNS), affecting multiple North American bat species during the hibernation period, is a highly pathogenic disease caused by the psychrophilic fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Because the fungal pathogen persists in the hibernation site environment independently of the hosts, previous theory on spatial disease dynamics cannot predict WNS epidemics. However, the ability to understand factors contributing to the spread of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in North America is crucial to the management of infected and susceptible bat populations as well as the conservation of threatened and endangered bat species. Utilizing recent theory on environmental opportunistic pathogens, we modelled the effect of (a) landscape clustering, (b) environmental conditions in hibernacula and (c) microbial competition on the spread of WNS. We used available, already published data to construct and parameterize our model, which takes into account the spatial distribution of hibernation sites, temperature conditions in both the outside ambient and hibernation site environment, bat population dynamics, dispersal and infection by the pathogen, which also has its host-independent dynamics with the environment. We also consider the effect of outside-host competition between the pathogen and other micro-organisms on spatial disease dynamics. Our model suggests that pathogen loads accumulate in poorly connected hibernacula at short host dispersal, which can help found the epidemic. In contrast, invasion of the landscape is most successful at long host dispersal distances, with homogenous hibernation site distribution and heterogeneous between-hibernation site temperatures. Also, increasing the mean temperature across hibernacula increases fungal growth rate, leading to higher disease prevalence and faster invasion rate. Increasing spatial heterogeneity in hibernaculum temperatures results in the formation of disease hotspots in warmer hibernacula, facilitating more effective spread of the disease in the landscape. Cold-adapted competing microbes can prevent invasion, and therefore, overwintering in cold hibernacula increases probability of host survival. Sites that were suboptimal for overwintering prior to WNS may have importance in preventing local extirpations. Although the model is tailored for WNS, due to pressing need for results that can assist in planning conservation measures, these novel results can be broadly applied to other environmentally transmitted diseases. A is available for this article.

TI Quantitative host resistance drives the evolution of increased virulence
   in an emerging pathogen
AB Emergent infectious diseases can have a devastating impact on host populations. The high selective pressures on both the hosts and the pathogens frequently lead to rapid adaptations not only in pathogen virulence but also host resistance following an initial outbreak. However, it is often unclear whether hosts will evolve to avoid infection-associated fitness costs by preventing the establishment of infection (here referred to as qualitative resistance) or by limiting its deleterious effects through immune functioning (here referred to as quantitative resistance). Equally, the evolutionary repercussions these different resistance mechanisms have for the pathogen are often unknown. Here, we investigate the co-evolutionary dynamics of pathogen virulence and host resistance following the epizootic outbreak of the highly pathogenic bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum in North American house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus). Using an evolutionary modelling approach and with a specific emphasis on the evolved resistance trait, we demonstrate that the rapid increase in the frequency of resistant birds following the outbreak is indicative of strong selection pressure to reduce infection-associated mortality. This, in turn, created the ecological conditions that selected for increased bacterial virulence. Our results thus suggest that quantitative host resistance was the key factor underlying the evolutionary interactions in this natural host-pathogen system.

TI Vertical transmission of naturally occurring Bunyamwera and
   insect-specific flavivirus infections in mosquitoes from islands and
   mainland shores of Lakes Victoria and Baringo in Kenya
AB Background
   Many arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes have been implicated as causative agents of both human and animal illnesses in East Africa. Although epidemics of arboviral emerging infectious diseases have risen in frequency in recent years, the extent to which mosquitoes maintain pathogens in circulation during inter-epidemic periods is still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate whether arboviruses may be maintained by vertical transmission via immature life stages of different mosquito vector species.
   Methodology
   We collected immature mosquitoes (egg, larva, pupa) on the shores and islands of Lake Baringo and Lake Victoria in western Kenya and reared them to adults. Mosquito pools (<= 25 specimens/pool) of each species were screened for mosquito-borne viruses by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing of multiplex PCR products of genus-specific primers (alphaviruses, flaviviruses, phleboviruses and Bunyamwera-group orthobunya-viruses). We further confirmed positive samples by culturing in baby hamster kidney and Aedes mosquito cell lines and re-sequencing.
   Principal findings
   Culex univittatus (2/31pools) and Anopheles gambiae (1/77 pools) from the Lake Victoria region were positive for Bunyamwera virus, a pathogenic virus that is of public health concern. In addition, Aedes aegypti (3/50), Aedes luteocephalus (3/13), Aedes spp. (2/15), and Culex pipiens (1/140) pools were positive for Aedes flaviviruses at Lake Victoria, whereas at Lake Baringo, three pools of An. gambiae mosquitoes were positive for Anopheles flavivirus. These insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs), which are presumably non-pathogenic to vertebrates, were found in known medically important arbovirus and malaria vectors.
   Conclusions
   Our results suggest that not only ISFVs, but also a pathogenic arbovirus, are naturally maintained within mosquito populations by vertical transmission, even in the absence of vertebrate hosts. Therefore, virus and vector surveillance, even during inter-epidemics, and the study of vector-arbovirus-ISFV interactions, may aid in identifying arbovirus transmission risks, with the potential to inform control strategies that lead to disease prevention.

TI A comparison of Zika and dengue outbreaks using national surveillance
   data in the Dominican Republic
AB Background
   Aedes-borne arboviruses continue to precipitate epidemics worldwide. In Dominican Republic, the appearance of Zika virus cases that closely followed a large dengue epidemic provided an opportunity to study the different transmission drivers behind these two flaviviruses. Retrospective datasets were used to collect information on the populations at risk and descriptive statistics were used to describe the outbreaks on a national scale.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Expectedly, box plots showed that 75% of dengue was reported in those aged <20 years while Zika infections were more widely dispersed among the population. Dengue attack rates were marginally higher among males at 25.9 per 10,000 population vs. 21.5 per 10,000 population for females. Zika infections appeared to be highly clustered among females (73.8% (95% CI 72.6%, 75.0%; p<0.05)); age-adjusted Zika attack rates among females were 7.64 per 10,000 population compared with 2.72 per 10,000 population among males. R0 calculations stratified by sex also showed a significantly higher metric among females: 1.84 (1.82, 1.87; p<0.05) when compared to males at 1.72 (1.69, 1.75; p<0.05). However, GBS attack rates stratified by sex revealed slightly higher risk in males vs. females, at 0.62 and 0.57 per 10,000 population respectively.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Evidence suggests little impact of existing dengue immunity on reported attack rates of Zika at the population level. Confounding of R0 and incident risk calculations by sex-specific over-reporting can alter the reliability of epidemiological metrics, which could be addressed using associated proxy syndromes or conditions to explore seemingly sex-skewed incidence. The findings indicate that community awareness campaigns, through influencing short-term health seeking behaviour, remain the most plausible mechanism behind increased reporting among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot yet be ruled out. Media campaigns and screening are therefore recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on clinical Zika outcomes among dengue seropositive individuals.

TI Molecular genotyping, diversity studies and high-resolution molecular
   markers unveiled by microsatellites in Giardia duodenalis
AB Background
   Giardia duodenalis (synonyms G. lamblia and G. intestinalis) is an enteric protozoan parasite of a wide range of mammalian hosts, including humans and various domestic and wild animals. There is considerable genetic variability in G. duodenalis and isolates of this parasite have been divided into eight genetic assemblages. Microsatellites markers can be used to discriminate isolates with a high level of sensitivity. This study was conducted to identify and characterize genomic microsatellites (simple sequence repeats-SSRs), sequences of one- to six-nucleotide motifs repeated in tandem, present in the available genomes of G. duodenalis and to develop new markers that can serve as a tool for detection and for characterizing the genetic diversity of this parasite.
   Methodology/ Principal findings
   For each genetic assemblage, polymorphism levels for the microsatellite markers were evaluated. After performing the analysis using the MISA and SciRoKo software, 1,853 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified. In all the genomes, trinucleotide repeats were the most common class followed by tetranucleotide. Many of the SSR loci are assemblage-specific, and 36 SSR loci shared among all the genomes were identified. Together with hypothetical proteins, variant-specific surface proteins represented nearly half of the annotated SSR loci. The results regarding the most common repeat among the SSRs led us to infer that positive selection occurred to avoid frameshift mutations. Additionally, based on interand intra-genetic assemblages polymorphism analyses, we unveiled previously undetected genetic variation, indicating that the microsatellite markers we developed are useful molecular tools for epidemiological inferences based on population genetics patterns and processes.
   Conclusions
   There is increasing demand for the development of new molecular markers and for the characterization of pathogens at a higher resolution level. In this study, we present 60 G. duodenalis microsatellites markers that exhibited high polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification efficiency among the different genetic assemblages. Twenty of these markers presented nucleotide sequence polymorphisms and may be used as a genotyping tool. The monomorphic markers can be used for the detection of the parasite at the species and genetic assemblage level. These polymorphic markers revealed a genetic diversity that was previously undetectable, thus they can be considered valuable molecular tools for high resolution markers in future studies investigating Giardia and may also be used for epidemiological inferences based on populations genetics patterns and processes.

TI Seasonal and interannual risks of dengue introduction from South-East
   Asia into China, 2005-2015
AB Due to worldwide increased human mobility, air-transportation data and mathematical models have been widely used to measure risks of global dispersal of pathogens. However, the seasonal and interannual risks of pathogens importation and onward transmission from endemic countries have rarely been quantified and validated. We constructed a modelling framework, integrating air travel, epidemiological, demographical, entomological and meteorological data, to measure the seasonal probability of dengue introduction from endemic countries. This framework has been applied retrospectively to elucidate spatiotemporal patterns and increasing seasonal risk of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China via air travel in multiple populations, Chinese travelers and local residents, over a decade of 2005-15. We found that the volume of airline travelers from South-East Asia into China has quadrupled from 2005 to 2015 with Chinese travelers increased rapidly. Following the growth of air traffic, the probability of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China has increased dramatically from 2005 to 2015. This study also revealed seasonal asymmetries of transmission routes: Sri Lanka and Maldives have emerged as origins; neglected cities at central and coastal China have been increasingly vulnerable to dengue importation and onward transmission. Compared to the monthly occurrence of dengue reported in China, our model performed robustly for importation and onward transmission risk estimates. The approach and evidence could facilitate to understand and mitigate the changing seasonal threat of arbovirus from endemic regions.

TI Serological evidence of inter-epizootic/interepidemic circulation of
   Rift Valley fever virus in domestic cattle in Kyela and Morogoro,
   Tanzania
AB Background
   Tanzania is among the Rift Valley fever (RVF) epizootic/endemic countries in sub Saharan Africa, where RVF disease outbreaks occur within a range of 3 to 17-year intervals. Detection of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibodies in animals in regions with no previous history of outbreaks raises the question of whether the disease is overlooked due to lack-of effective surveillance systems, or if there are strains of RVFV with low pathogenicity. Furthermore, which vertebrate hosts are involved in the inter-epidemic and inter-epizootic maintenance of RVFV? In our study region, the Kyela and Morogoro districts in Tanzania, no previous RVF outbreaks have been reported.
   Methodology
   The study was conducted from June 2014 to October 2015 in the Kyela and Morogoro districts, Tanzania. Samples (n = 356) were retrieved from both the local breed of zebu cattle (Bos indicus) and Bos indicus/Bos Taurus cross breed. RVFV antibodies were analyzed by two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approaches. Initially, samples were analyzed by a RVFV multi-species competition ELISA (cELISA), which detected both RVFV IgG and IgM antibodies. All serum samples that were positive with the cELISA method were specifically analysed for the presence of RVFV IgM antibodies to trace recent infection. A plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT80) was performed to determine presence of RVFV neutralizing antibodies in all cELISA positive samples.
   Findings
   Overall RVFV seroprevalence rate in cattle by cELISA in both districts was 29.2% (104 of 356) with seroprevalence rates of 33% (47/147) in the Kyela district and 27% (57/209) in the Morogoro district. In total, 8.4% (30/356) of all cattle sampled had RVFV IgM antibodies, indicating current disease transmission. When segregated by districts, the IgM antibody seroprevalence was 2.0% (3/147) and 12.9% (27/209) in Kyela and Morogoro districts respectively. When the 104 cELISA positive samples were analyzed by PRNT80 to confirm that RVFV-specific antibodies were present, the majority (89%, 93/104) had RVFV neutralising antibodies.
   Conclusion
   The results provided evidence of widespread prevalence of RVFV antibody among cattle during an inter-epizootic/inter-epidemic period in Tanzania in regions with no previous history of outbreaks. There is a need for further investigations of RVFV maintenance and transmission in vertebrates and vectors during the long inter-epizootic/inter-epidemic periods.

TI The ectodomains of the lymphocyte scavenger receptors CD5 and CD6
   interact with tegumental antigens from Echinococcus granulosus sensu
   lato and protect mice against secondary cystic echinococcosis
AB Background
   Scavenger Receptors (SRs) from the host's innate immune system are known to bind multiple ligands to promote the removal of non-self or altered-self targets. CD5 and CD6 are two highly homologous class I SRs mainly expressed on all T cells and the B1a cell subset, and involved in the fine tuning of activation and differentiation signals delivered by the antigen-specific receptors (TCR and BCR, respectively), to which they physically associate. Additionally, CD5 and CD6 have been shown to interact with and sense the presence of conserved pathogen-associated structures from bacteria, fungi and/or viruses.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We report herein the interaction of CD5 and CD6 lymphocyte surface receptors with Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.). Binding studies show that both soluble and membrane-bound forms of CD5 and CD6 bind to intact viable protoscoleces from E. granulosus s.l. through recognition of metaperiodate-resistant tegumental components. Proteomic analyses allowed identification of thioredoxin peroxidase for CD5, and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (cyclophilin) and endophilin B1 (antigen P-29) for CD6, as their potential interactors. Further in vitro assays demonstrate that membrane-bound or soluble CD5 and CD6 forms differentially modulate the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine release induced following peritoneal cells exposure to E. granulosus s.l. tegumental components. Importantly, prophylactic infusion of soluble CD5 or CD6 significantly ameliorated the infection outcome in the mouse model of secondary cystic echinococcosis.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Taken together, the results expand the pathogen binding properties of CD5 and CD6 and provide novel evidence for their therapeutic potential in human cystic echinococcosis.

TI Use of anthropophilic culicid-based xenosurveillance as a proxy for
   Plasmodium vivax malaria burden and transmission hotspots identification
AB Vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases, causing more than one million deaths annually. Malaria remains one of the most important public health problems worldwide. These vectors are bloodsucking insects, which can transmit disease-producing microorganisms during a blood meal. The contact of culicids with human populations living in malaria-endemic areas suggests that the identification of Plasmodium genetic material in the blood present in the gut of these mosquitoes may be possible. The process of assessing the blood meal for the presence of pathogens is termed 'xenosurveillance'. In view of this, the present work investigated the relationship between the frequency with which Plasmodium DNA is found in culicids and the frequency with which individuals are found to be carrying malaria parasites. A cross-sectional study was performed in a peri-urban area of Manaus, in the Western Brazilian Amazon, by simultaneously collecting human blood samples and trapping culicids from households. A total of 875 individuals were included in the study and a total of 13,374mosquito specimens were captured. Malaria prevalence in the study area was 7.7%. The frequency of households with at least one culicid specimen carrying Plasmodium DNA was 6.4%. Plasmodium infection incidence was significantly related to whether any Plasmodium positive blood-fed culicid was found in the same household [IRR 3.49 (CI95% 1.38-8.84); p = 0.008] and for indoor-collected culicids [IRR 4.07 (CI95% 1.25-13.24); p = 0.020]. Furthermore, the number of infected people in the house at the time of mosquito collection was related to whether there were any positive blood-fed culicid mosquitoes in that household for collection methods combined [IRR 4.48 (CI95% 2.22-9.05); p<0.001] or only for indoor-collected culicids [IRR 4.88 (CI95%2.01-11.82); p<0.001]. Our results suggest that xenosurveillance can be used in endemic tropical regions in order to estimate the malaria burden and identify transmission foci in areas where Plasmodium vivax is predominant.

TI Rodent control to fight Lassa fever: Evaluation and lessons learned from
   a 4-year study in Upper Guinea
AB Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever caused by an arenavirus. The disease is endemic in West African countries, including Guinea. The rodents Mastomys natalensis and Mastomys erythroleucus have been identified as Lassa virus reservoirs in Guinea. In the absence of a vaccine, rodent control and human behavioural changes are the only options to prevent Lassa fever in highly endemic areas. We performed a 4 year intervention based on chemical rodent control, utilizing anticoagulant rodenticides in 3 villages and evaluating the rodent abundance before and after treatment. Three additional villages were investigated as controls. Analyses to assess the effectiveness of the intervention, bait consumption and rodent dynamics were performed. Anthropological investigations accompanied the intervention to integrate local understandings of human-rodent cohabitation and rodent control intervention. Patterns of bait consumption showed a peak at days 5-7 and no consumption at days 28-30. There was no difference between Bromadiolone and Difenacoum bait consumption. The main rodent species found in the houses was M. natalensis. The abundance of M. natalensis, as measured by the trapping success, varied between 3.6 and 16.7% before treatment and decreased significantly to 1-2% after treatment. Individuals in treated villages welcomed the intervention and trapping because mice are generally regarded as a nuisance. Immediate benefits from controlling rodents included protection of food and belongings. Before the intervention, local awareness of Lassa fever was non-existent. Despite their appreciation for the intervention, local individuals noted its limits and the need for complementary actions. Our results demonstrate that chemical treatment provides an effective tool to control local rodent populations and can serve as part of an effective, holistic approach combining rodent trapping, use of local rodenticides, environmental hygiene, house repairs and rodent-proof storage. These actions should be developed in collaboration with local stakeholders and communities.

TI Identification and binding mode of a novel Leishmania Trypanothione
   reductase inhibitor from high throughput screening
AB Trypanothione reductase (TR) is considered to be one of the best targets to find new drugs against Leishmaniasis. This enzyme is fundamental for parasite survival in the host since it reduces trypanothione, a molecule used by the tryparedoxin/tryparedoxin peroxidase system of Leishmania to neutralize hydrogen peroxide produced by host macrophages during infection. In order to identify new lead compounds against Leishmania we developed and validated a new luminescence-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay that allowed us to screen a library of 120,000 compounds. We identified a novel chemical class of TR inhibitors, able to kill parasites with an IC50 in the low micromolar range. The X-ray crystal structure of TR in complex with a compound from this class (compound 3) allowed the identification of its binding site in a pocket at the entrance of the NADPH binding site. Since the binding site of compound 3 identified by the X-ray structure is unique, and is not present in human homologs such as glutathione reductase (hGR), it represents a new target for drug discovery efforts.

TI Antivirus effectiveness of ivermectin on dengue virus type 2 in Aedes
   albopictus
AB Background
   Dengue fever is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease over the past 50 years, with a 30-fold increase in global incidence. Dengue vector control is a key component for the dengue control strategy, since no absolutely effective vaccine or drug is available yet. However, the rapid rise and spread of mosquito insecticide resistance have become major threats to the efficiency of insecticide-based vector control activities. Thus, innovative vector control tools are badly needed. This study aims to confirm the antivirus effectiveness of ivermectin on dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) in Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894), then to explore its potential use in the combating to the dengue epidemics.
   Methods
   Aedes albopictus were first infected with DENV-2 in human whole blood, and at the fourth day after infectious blood feeding, they were divided into eight groups. Seven of them were held for six days with access to 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ng/ml ivermectin, respectively, and the last one was set as a historical control group, which was stored at -80 degrees C until being detected at the same time with the other groups. Each mosquito was detected using realtime fluorescent RT-PCR kit. DENV-2 RNA concentration (copies/ml) and infection rate in each group were compared.
   Results
   Both of quantitatively and qualitatively inhibiting effects of ivermectin have been detected in this study. Generally, DENV-2 replicated well in Aedes albopictus without ivermectin intervention, whose virus loads exhibited significantly higher when the mosquitoes were holding from 4 days to 10 days after infectious blood feeding. In contrast, with the treatment of ivermectin, the infection rate was reduced by as much as 49.63%. The regression equation between infection rates (Y-2) and ivermectin concentration log(2) values (X-2) was obtained as Y-2 = 91.41-7.21* X-2 with R-2 = 0.89.
   Conclusion
   Ivermectin can directly or indirectly inhibit DENV-2 multiplication in Aedes albopictus. Moreover, the actual concentration for application in zooprophylaxis needs to be confirmed in the further field trials.

TI Backpack PCR: A point-of-collection diagnostic platform for the rapid
   detection of Brugia parasites in mosquitoes
AB Background
   Currently, molecular xenomonitoring efforts for lymphatic filariasis rely on PCR or real-time PCR-based detection of Brugia malayi, Brugia timori and Wuchereria bancrofti in mosquito vectors. Most commonly, extraction of DNA from mosquitoes is performed using silica column-based technologies. However, such extractions are both time consuming and costly, and the diagnostic testing which follows typically requires expensive thermal cyclers or real-time PCR instruments. These expenses present significant challenges for laboratories in many endemic areas. Accordingly, in such locations, there exists a need for inexpensive, equipment-minimizing diagnostic options that can be transported to the field and implemented in minimal resource settings. Here we present a novel diagnostic approach for molecular xenomonitoring of filarial parasites in mosquitoes that uses a rapid, NaOH-based DNA extraction methodology coupled with a portable, battery powered PCR platform and a test strip-based DNA detection assay. While the research reported here serves as a proof-of-concept for the backpack PCR methodology for the detection of filarial parasites in mosquitoes, the platform should be easily adaptable to the detection of W. bancrofti and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Through comparisons with standard silica column-based DNA extraction techniques, we evaluated the performance of a rapid, NaOH-based methodology for the extraction of total DNA from pools of parasite-spiked vector mosquitoes. We also compared our novel test strip-based detection assay to real-time PCR and conventional PCR coupled with gel electrophoresis, and demonstrated that this method provides sensitive and genus-specific detection of parasite DNA from extracted mosquito pools. Finally, by comparing laboratory-based thermal cycling with a field-friendly miniaturized PCR approach, we have demonstrated the potential for the point-of-collection-based use of this entire diagnostic platform that is compact enough to fit into a small backpack.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Because this point-of-collection diagnostic platform eliminates reliance on expensive and bulky instrumentation without compromising sensitivity or specificity of detection, it provides an alternative to cost-prohibitive column-dependent DNA extractions that are typically coupled to detection methodologies requiring advanced laboratory infrastructure. In doing so, this field-ready system should increase the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring within B. malayi-endemic locations. Of greater importance, this backpack PCR system also provides the proof-of-concept framework for the development of a parallel assay for the detection of W. bancrofti.

TI A host immune hormone modifies parasite species interactions and
   epidemics: insights from a field manipulation
AB Parasite epidemics can depend on priority effects, and parasite priority effects can result from the host immune response to prior infection. Yet we lack experimental evidence that such immune-mediated priority effects influence epidemics. To address this research gap, we manipulated key host immune hormones, then measured the consequences for within-host parasite interactions, and ultimately parasite epidemics in the field. Specifically, we applied plant immune-signalling hormones to sentinel plants, embedded into a wild host population, and tracked foliar infections caused by two common fungal parasites. Within-host individuals, priority effects were altered by the immune-signalling hormone, salicylic acid (SA). Scaling up from within-host interactions, hosts treated with SA experienced a lower prevalence of a less aggressive parasite, increased burden of infection by a more aggressive parasite, and experienced fewer co-infections. Together, these results indicate that by altering within-host priority effects, host immune hormones can drive parasite epidemics. This study therefore experimentally links host immune hormones to within-host priority effects and parasite epidemics, advancing a more mechanistic understanding of how interactions among parasites alter their epidemics.

TI Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis Analysis of Bacteria in Italian
   Ticks and First Detection of Streptococcus equi in Rhipicephalus bursa
   from the Lazio Region
AB Tick-borne diseases are an increasing problem for the community. Ticks harbor a complex microbial population acquired while feeding on a variety of animals. Profiling the bacterial population by 16S rDNA amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis enables detection of the broad spectrum of bacteria that settles in the ticks. This study identified known and unknown tick-infecting bacteria in samples from Italy. Seven adult ticks from different hosts and origins were analyzed: two Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks from dogs (Lombardia), two Rhipicephalus bursa ticks from bovines (Lazio), and three Ixodes ricinus ticks from humans (Marche). The major result was the first report of the zoonotic agent Streptococcus equi in ticks. S. equi is a species complex of highly contagious pathogens. Subsequent to S. equi detection in a R. bursa tick removed from a bovine of Lazio in 2012, we studied 95 R. bursa samples collected from 3 bovines, 3 ponies, and 1 sheep grazing in the same area in 2012 and from 6 ponies grazing there in 2017. The results of a specific PCR assay indicated a not sporadic occurrence of S. equi in ticks. This finding provides a basis for assessing the potential of ticks to harbor and disperse S. equi.

TI Vector-Borne Zoonotic Pathogens in Eurasian Moose (Alces alces alces)
AB Climate change, with warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, has affected the distribution of vectors and vector-borne diseases. In the northern hemisphere, vectors are spreading north, and with them, pathogens of zoonotic and animal health impact. Eurasian moose (Alces alces alces) are physiologically and anatomically adapted for cold climate, and are rarely considered ideal hosts of vectors, apart from deer keds (Lipoptena cervi). To investigate the presence of vector-borne pathogens, spleen samples from 615 moose were collected in southern Sweden from 2008 to 2015. The samples were analyzed with a high-throughput PCR method for 24 bacterial, and 12 parasitic pathogens. Anaplasma (82%), Borrelia (3%), Babesia (3%), and Bartonella (1%) DNA was found, showing that moose are exposed to, and can act as hosts of some of these pathogens, which can have an impact of both animal and human health. These results show that Swedish moose are exposed to pathogens that in some instances are more commonly found in regions with warmer climate, and highlights the importance of also considering moose as sentinels of vector-borne pathogens. Further research is needed to understand the effect of these pathogens on the health of individual moose and to elucidate whether climate change and moose population density interact to create the pattern observed.

TI Resource-Effective Serosurveillance for the Detection of West Nile Virus
   in Switzerland Using Abattoir Samples of Free-Range Laying Hens
AB West Nile virus (WNV) is an important zoonotic pathogen maintained in a natural transmission cycle between mosquitoes and birds as reservoir hosts. In dead-end hosts, such as humans, infection may result in fatal neurologic disease translating into disease and death-related suffering and increased health care costs. In humans, WNV may also be transmitted through blood transfusions and organ transplants. WNV is not present in Switzerland yet, but competent vector species (especially Culex pipiens and Aedes japonicus) are prevalent and an introduction of the virus, likely through wild birds, is expected at any time. Therefore, it is important for Switzerland to be prepared and establish a surveillance system for WNV to initiate increased prevention activities, such as the screening of blood and organ donations and public education activities in case virus circulation is detected. The long-term goal of these surveillance measures would be a reduced infection rate in humans resulting in less suffering and reduced health care costs. To provide the basis for a pragmatic and resource-effective WNV surveillance program, this study used aliquots of serum samples of free-range laying hens taken at the abattoir and collected in the frame of the ongoing Swiss Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease monitoring program for a 2-year period. All 961 aliquots were analyzed using a commercial competitive WNV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The study allowed to set up sampling and laboratory routines as a basis for future WNV surveillance activities. At this stage there is no evidence for circulation of WNV in Switzerland.

TI Sex bias in ability to cope with cancer: Tasmanian devils and facial
   tumour disease
AB Knowledge of the ecological dynamics between hosts and pathogens during t he initial stages of disease emergence is crucial to understanding the potential for evolution of new interspecific interactions. Tasmanian devil (Sareophilus harrish) populations have declined precipitously owing to infection by a transmissible cancer (devil facial tumour disease, DFTD) that emerged approximately 20 years ago. Since the emergence of DFTD, and as the disease spreads across Tasmania, the number of devils has dropped up to 90% across 80% of the species's distributional range. As a result, the disease is expected to act as a strong selective force on hosts to develop mechanisms of tolerance and /or resistance to the infection. We assessed the ability of infected devils to cope with infection, which translates into host tolerance to the cancer, by using the reaction norm of the individual body condition by tumour burden. We found that body condition of infected hosts is negatively affected by cancer progression. Males and females presented significant differences in their tolerance levels to infection, with males suffering declines of up to 25% of their body condition, in contrast to less than 5% in females. Sex-related differences in tolerance to cancer progression may select for changes in life-history strategies of the host and could also alter the selective environment for the tumours.

TI Metrics matter: the effect of parasite richness, intensity and
   prevalence on the evolution of host migration
AB Parasites have long been thought to influence the evolution of migration, but precisely determining the conditions under which this occurs by quantifying costs of infection remains a challenge. Here we developed a model that demonstrates how the metric used to describe infection (richness/diversity, prevalence or intensity) shapes the prediction of whether migration will evolve. The model shows that predictions based on minimizing richness yield opposite results compared to those based on minimizing prevalence, is with migration only selected for when minimizing prevalence. Consistent with these findings, empirical studies that measure parasite diversity typically find that migrants are worse off than residents, while those measuring prevalence or intensity find the opposite. Our own empirical analysis of fish parasite data finds that migrants (of all types) have higher parasite richness than residents, but with no significant difference in either prevalence or intensity.

TI Trade and conservation implications of new beak and feather disease
   virus detection in native and introduced parrots
AB Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), caused by Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), has spread rapidly around the world, raising concerns for threatened species conservation and biosecurity associated with the global pet bird trade. The virus has been reported in several wild parrot populations, but data are lacking for many taxa and geographical areas with high parrot endemism. We aimed to advance understanding of BFDV distribution in many data-deficient areas and determine phylogenetic and biogeographic associations of the virus in 5 parrot species across Africa, the Indian Ocean islands, Asia, and Europe and focused specifically on the highly traded and invasive Psittacula krameri. Blood, feather, and tissue samples were screened for BFDV through standard polymerase chain reaction. Isolates obtained from positive individuals were then analyzed in a maximum likelihood phylogeny along with all other publically available global BFDV sequences. We detected BFDV in 8 countries where it was not known to occur previously, indicating the virus is more widely distributed than currently recognized. We documented for the first time the presence of BFDV in wild populations of P. krameri within its native range in Asia and Africa. We detected BFDV among introduced P. krameri in Mauritius and the Seychelles, raising concerns for island endemic species in the region. Phylogenetic relationships between viral sequences showed likely pathways of transmission between populations in southern Asia and western Africa. A high degree of phylogenetic relatedness between viral variants from geographically distant populations suggests recent introductions, likely driven by global trade. These findings highlight the need for effective regulation of international trade in live parrots, particularly in regions with high parrot endemism or vulnerable taxa where P. krameri could act as a reservoir host.

TI A model for leptospire dynamics and control in the Norway rat (Rattus
   norvegicus) the reservoir host in urban slum environments
AB Leptospirosis is a zoonosis that humans can contract via contact with animal reservoirs directly or with water contaminated with their urine. The primary reservoir of pathogenic leptospires within urban slum environments is the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus). Motivated by the annual outbreaks of human leptospirosis in slum urban settings, the within population infection dynamics of the Norway rat were investigated in Pau da Lima, an community in Salvador, Brazil. A mechanistic model of the dynamics of leptospire infection was informed by extensive field and laboratory data was developed and explored analytically. To identify the intraspecific transmission route of most importance, a global sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number to its components was performed. In addition, different methods of rodent control were investigated by calculating target reproduction numbers. Our results suggest environmental transmission plays an important role in the maintenance of infection in the rodent population. To control numbers of wild Norway rats, combinations of controls are recommended but environmental control should also be investigated to reduce prevalence of infection in rats.

TI Using serological studies to reconstruct the history of bluetongue
   epidemic in French cattle under successive vaccination campaigns
AB Bluetongue virus is a vector-borne pathogen affecting ruminants that has caused major epidemics in France. Reconstructing the history of bluetongue in French cattle under control strategies such as vaccination has been hampered by the high level of sub-clinical infection, incomplete case data and poor understanding of vaccine uptake over time and space. To tackle these challenges, we used three age-structured serological surveys carried out in cattle (N = 22,342) from ten administrative subdivisions called departments. We fitted catalytic models within a Bayesian MCMC framework to reconstruct the force of seroconversion from infection or vaccination, and the population-level susceptibility per semester between 2007 and 2016. In the departments of the study area, we estimated that 36% of cattle had been infected prior to vaccine rollout that became compulsory from July 2008. The last outbreak case was notified in December 2009, at which time 83% of the animals were seropositive, under the cumulative effect of vaccination and infection. The probability of seroconversion per semester dropped below 10% after 2010 when vaccination became optional. Vaccine uptake was smaller during the 2012 campaign than during the one in 2011, with strong regional contrasts. Eighty four percent of cattle were susceptible when bluetongue re-emerged in 2015. Thus, serological surveys can be used to estimate vaccine uptake and the magnitude of infection, the relative effect of which can sometimes be inferred using prior knowledge on reported incidence and vaccination dates.

TI Practical unidentifiability of a simple vector-borne disease model:
   Implications for parameter estimation and intervention assessment
AB Mathematical modeling has an extensive history in vector-borne disease epidemiology, and is increasingly used for prediction, intervention design, and understanding mechanisms. Many studies rely on parameter estimation to link models and data, and to tailor predictions and counterfactuals to specific settings. However, few studies have formally evaluated whether vector-borne disease models can properly estimate the parameters of interest given the constraints of a particular dataset. Identifiability analysis allows us to examine whether model parameters can be estimated uniquely-a lack of consideration of such issues can result in misleading or incorrect parameter estimates and model predictions. Here, we evaluate both structural (theoretical) and practical identifiability of a commonly used compartmental model of mosquito-borne disease, using the 2010 dengue epidemic in Taiwan as a case study. We show that while the model is structurally identifiable, it is practically unidentifiable under a range of human and mosquito time series measurement scenarios. In particular, the transmission parameters form a practically identifiable combination and thus cannot be estimated separately, potentially leading to incorrect predictions of the effects of interventions. However, in spite of the unidentifiability of the individual parameters, the basic reproduction number was successfully estimated across the unidentifiable parameter ranges. These identifiability issues can be resolved by directly measuring several additional human and mosquito life-cycle parameters both experimentally and in the field. While we only consider the simplest case for the model, we show that a commonly used model of vector-borne disease is unidentifiable from human and mosquito incidence data, making it difficult or impossible to estimate parameters or assess intervention strategies. This work illustrates the importance of examining identifiability when linking models with data to make predictions and inferences, and particularly highlights the importance of combining laboratory, field, and case data if we are to successfully estimate epidemiological and ecological parameters using models.

TI Excess mortality in Guadeloupe and Martinique, islands of the French
   West Indies, during the chikungunya epidemic of 2014
AB In some chikungunya epidemics, deaths are not completely captured by traditional surveillance systems, which record case and death reports. We evaluated excess deaths associated with the 2014 chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemic in Guadeloupe and Martinique, Antilles. Population (784 097 inhabitants) and mortality data, estimated by sex and age, were accessed from the Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques in France. Epidemiological data, cases, hospitalisations and deaths on CHIKV were obtained from the official epidemiological reports of the Cellule de Institut de Veille Sanitaire in France. Excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the expected and observed deaths for all age groups for each month in 2014 and 2015, considering the upper limit of 99% confidence interval. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a strong correlation between monthly excess deaths and reported cases of chikungunya (R = 0.81, p < 0.005) and with a 1-month lag (R = 0.87, p < 0.001); and a strong correlation was also observed between monthly rates of hospitalisation for CHIKV and excess deaths with a delay of 1 month (R = 0.87, p < 0.0005). The peak of the epidemic occurred in the month with the highest mortality, returning to normal soon after the end of the CHIKV epidemic. There were excess deaths in almost all age groups, and excess mortality rate was higher among the elderly but was similar between male and female individuals. The overall mortality estimated in the current study (639 deaths) was about four times greater than that obtained through death declarations (160 deaths). Although the aetiological diagnosis of all deaths associated with CHIKV infection is not always possible, already well-known statistical tools can contribute to the evaluation of the impact of CHIKV on mortality and morbidity in the different age groups.

TI On the relationship between body condition and parasite infection in
   wildlife: a review and meta-analysis
AB Body condition metrics are widely used to infer animal health and to assess costs of parasite infection. Since parasites harm their hosts, ecologists might expect negative relationships between infection and condition in wildlife, but this assumption is challenged by studies showing positive or null condition-infection relationships. Here, we outline common condition metrics used by ecologists in studies of parasitism, and consider mechanisms that cause negative, positive, and null condition-infection relationships in wildlife systems. We then perform a meta-analysis of 553 condition-infection relationships from 187 peer-reviewed studies of animal hosts, analysing observational and experimental records separately, and noting whether authors measured binary infection status or intensity. Our analysis finds substantial heterogeneity in the strength and direction of condition-infection relationships, a small, negative average effect size that is stronger in experimental studies, and evidence for publication bias towards negative relationships. The strongest predictors of variation in study outcomes are host thermoregulation and the methods used to evaluate body condition. We recommend that studies aiming to assess parasite impacts on body condition should consider host-parasite biology, choose condition measures that can change during the course of infection, and employ longitudinal surveys or manipulate infection status when feasible.

TI Natural Selection on Antihelminth Antibodies in a Wild Mammal Population
AB An effective immune response is expected to confer fitness benefits through improved resistance to parasites but also incur energetic costs that negatively impact fitness-related traits, such as reproduction. The fitness costs and benefits of an immune response are likely to depend on host age, sex, and levels of parasite exposure. Few studies have examined the full extent to which patterns of natural selection on immune phenotypes vary across demographic groups and environments in the wild. Here, we assessed natural selection on plasma levels of three functionally distinct isotypes (IgA, IgE, and IgG) of antibodies against a prevalent nematode parasite measured in a wild Soay sheep population over 26 years. We found little support for environment-dependent selection or reproductive costs. However, antibody levels were negatively associated with parasite egg counts and positively associated with subsequent survival, albeit in a highly age- and isotype-dependent manner. Raised levels of antiparasite IgA best predicted reduced egg counts, but this did not predict survival in lambs. In adults increased antiparasite IgG predicted reduced egg counts, and in adult females IgG levels also positively predicted overwinter survival. Our results highlight the potential importance of age- and sex-dependent selection on immune phenotypes in nature and show that patterns of selection can vary even among functionally related immune markers.

TI Multiscale Immune Selection and the Transmission-Diversity Feedback in
   Antigenically Diverse Pathogen Systems
AB Antigenic diversity is commonly used by pathogens to enhance their transmission success. Within-host clonal antigenic variation helps to maintain long infectious periods, whereas high levels of allelic diversity at the population level significantly expand the pool of susceptible individuals. Diversity, however, is not necessarily a static property of a pathogen population but in many cases is generated by the very act of infection and transmission, and it is therefore expected to respond dynamically to changes in transmission and immune selection. We hypothesized that this coupling creates a positive feedback whereby infection and disease transmission promote the generation of diversity, which itself facilitates immune evasion and further infections. To investigate this link in more detail, we considered the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, one of the most important antigenically diverse pathogens. We developed an individual-based model in which antigenic diversity emerges as a dynamic property from the underlying transmission processes. Our results show that the balance between stochastic extinction and the generation of new antigenic variants is intrinsically linked to within-host and between-host immune selection. This in turn determines the level of diversity that can be maintained in a given population. Furthermore, the transmission-diversity feedback can lead to temporal lags in the response to natural or intervention-induced perturbations in transmission rates. Our results therefore have important implications for monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of disease control efforts.

TI Reemergence of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus in the Americas
AB We summarize and analyze historical and current data regarding the reemergence of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV; genus Flavivirus) in the Americas. Historically, SLEV caused encephalitis outbreaks in the United States; however, it was not considered a public health concern in the rest of the Americas. After the introduction of West Nile virus in 1999, activity of SLEV decreased considerably in the United States. During 2014-2015, SLEV caused a human outbreak in Arizona and caused isolated human cases in California in 2016 and 2017. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the emerging SLEV in the western United States is related to the epidemic strains isolated during a human encephalitis outbreak in Cordoba, Argentina, in 2005. Ecoepidemiologic studies suggest that the emergence of SLEV in Argentina was caused by the introduction of a more pathogenic strain and increasing populations of the eared dove (amplifying host).

TI External Reinfection of a Fungal Pathogen Does not Contribute to
   Pathogen Growth
AB Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease of amphibians caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has led to devastating declines in amphibian populations worldwide. Current theory predicts that Bd infections are maintained through both reproduction on the host's skin and reinfection from sources outside of the host. To investigate the importance of external reinfection on pathogen burden, we infected captive-bred individuals of the highly susceptible Panamanian Golden Frog, Atelopus glyphus, and wild-caught glass frogs, Espadarana prosoblepon, with Bd. We housed the animals in one of three treatments: individually, in heterospecific pairs, and in conspecific pairs. For 8 weeks, we measured the Bd load and shedding rate of all frogs. We found that Atelopus had high rates of increase in both Bd load and shedding rate, but pathogen growth rates did not differ among treatments. The infection intensity of Espadarana co-housed with Atelopus was indistinguishable from those housed singly and those in conspecific pairs, despite being exposed to a large external source of Bd zoospores. Our results indicate that Bd load in both species is driven by pathogen replication within an individual, with reinfection from outside the host contributing little to the amplification of host fungal load.

TI Effects of host colony size and hygiene behaviours on social spider
   kleptoparasite loads along an elevation gradient
AB Group living animals are likely to attract more parasites than solitary ones. Parasite loads, however, should also depend on environmental conditions and on host characteristics and behaviours. Previous work has found that social spider colonies harbour communities of kleptoparasitic spiders that forego building their own web and, instead, steal prey from their social host. We examined kleptoparasite loads and host hygiene behaviours in colonies of social and subsocial spiders in the genus Anelosimus along an elevation gradient in eastern Ecuador. We found that kleptoparasite loads declined dramatically with increasing elevation. Host hygiene behaviours, such as debris removal, web repair and interactions with the parasites, also declined with elevation. Within elevations, species with more frequent hygiene behaviours appeared more successful at keeping parasites at bay. Contrary to our predictions, parasite density declined with host nest and colony size. The decline in parasite loads at higher elevations likely reflects a lower rate of energy exchange between colonies and their environments, where colder temperatures mean fewer and smaller prey for colonies to process. The decline in parasite density with host colony size may reflect a decline in the number of accessible prey in larger host colonies, as larger colonies should capture fewer but larger insects due to scaling properties of their three-dimensional webs. Social immunity, whereby a social host uses social behaviour to fight against parasites, has been studied in eusocial and non-eusocial insects. This study opens up social spiders as a novel system in which to study how host characteristics interact with environmental factors to affect parasite loads. It also introduces the concept of group-level immunity to social spiders and suggests a role for colony-level metabolism in determining ecological patterns in parasitism. A is available for this article.

TI Manipulating host resistance structure reveals impact of pathogen
   dispersal and environmental heterogeneity on epidemics
AB Understanding how variation in hosts, parasites, and the environment shapes patterns of disease is key to predicting ecological and evolutionary outcomes of epidemics. Yet in spatially structured populations, variation in host resistance may be spatially confounded with variation in parasite dispersal and environmental factors that affect disease processes. To tease apart these disease drivers, we paired surveys of natural epidemics with experiments manipulating spatial variation in host susceptibility to infection. We mapped epidemics of the wind-dispersed powdery mildew pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis in five populations of its plant host, Plantago lanceolata. At 15 replicate sites within each population, we deployed groups of healthy potted 'sentinel' plants from five allopatric host lines. By tracking which sentinels became infected in the field and measuring pathogen connectivity and microclimate at those sites, we could test how variation in these factors affected disease when spatial variation in host resistance and soil conditions was minimized. We found that the prevalence and severity of sentinel infection varied over small spatial scales in the field populations, largely due to heterogeneity in pathogen prevalence on wild plants and unmeasured environmental factors. Microclimate was critical for disease spread only at the onset of epidemics, where humidity increased infection risk. Sentinels were more likely to become infected than initially healthy wild plants at a given field site. However, in a follow-up laboratory inoculation study we detected no significant differences between wild and sentinel plant lines in their qualitative susceptibility to pathogen isolates from the field populations, suggesting that primarily non-genetic differences between sentinel and wild hosts drove their differential infection rates in the field. Our study leverages a multi-faceted experimental approach to disentangle important biotic and abiotic drivers of disease patterns within wild populations.

TI No measurable fitness cost to experimentally evolved host defence in the
   Caenorhabditis elegans-Serratia marcescens host-parasite system
AB Host susceptibility to parasites can vary over space and time. Costs associated with the maintenance of host defence are thought to account for a portion of this variation. Specifically, trade-offs wherein elevated defence is maintained at the cost of fitness in the absence of the parasite may cause levels of host defence to change over time and differ between populations. In previous studies, we found that populations of the host nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, evolved greater levels of parasite avoidance and resistance against the bacterial parasite, Serratia marcescens. Here, we passaged these host populations either in the presence or absence of the parasite to test for a cost of elevated host defences. After 16 generations, we found that elevated levels of host defence were maintained during evolution in both the presence and absence of the parasite. Further, this maintenance of defence was not the result of limited standing genetic variation, but rather the absence of a measurable cost associated with defence. Therefore, costs associated with host defence may not broadly account for differences in host susceptibility across space and time.

TI Exposure of Owned Dogs and Feeding Ticks to Spotted Fever Group
   Rickettsioses in Central Italy
AB Dogs may be useful sentinels for public health monitoring of spotted fever group rickettsioses (SFGR). The aim of this study was to determine the exposure to SFGR among dogs and feeding ticks in central Italy. A total of 344 dogs and 607 adult ticks (395 Rhipicephalus sanguineus and 212 Ixodes ricinus specimens) collected from the coats of sampled animals were included in the study. Canine serum samples were analyzed by indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) for IgG antibodies against Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia rickettsii. All the ticks and buffy coats were processed by a PCR targeting a fragment of gltA followed by sequencing. Overall, 56 dogs (16.3%) tested positive for one or both rickettsial antigens by IFAT with endpoint titers ranging from 1:64 to 1:2048; 38 (11%) serum samples reacted against R. conorii, 46 (13.4%) reacted against R. rickettsii, and 28 (8.1%) reacted simultaneously against both rickettsial agents. All buffy coats were PCR negative. Rickettsial DNA was revealed in 39 (18.4%) I. ricinus and in 10 (2.5%) R. sanguineus specimens. The amplicons sequencing showed three SFGR, that is, R. conorii detected in 10 R. sanguineus specimens and Rickettsia helvetica and Rickettsia monacensis detected in 7 and 32 I. ricinus ticks. Nine out of the 10 R. conorii isolates were obtained from ticks collected from seronegative dogs, and one specimen from a dog tested positive for both R. rickettsii and R. conorii by immunofluorescence assay. Among the seven ticks tested positive for R. helvetica, six were recovered from the coats of seronegative dogs and one from a dog having antibodies against R. conorii; the 32 isolates of R. monacensis were obtained from 28 seronegative and 4 R. conorii/R. rickettsii-positive dogs. The results highlight the non-negligible exposure of the canine population to SFGR in the sampled areas.

TI An Innovative Study Design to Assess the Community Effect of
   Interventions to Mitigate HIV Epidemics Using Transmission-Chain
   Phylodynamics
AB Given globalization and other social phenomena, controlling the spread of infectious diseases has become an imperative public health priority. A plethora of interventions that in theory can mitigate the spread of pathogens have been proposed and applied. Evaluating the effectiveness of such interventions is costly and in many circumstances unrealistic. Most important, the community effect (i.e., the ability of the intervention to minimize the spread of the pathogen from people who received the intervention to other community members) can rarely be evaluated. Here we propose a study design that can build and evaluate evidence in support of the community effect of an intervention. The approach exploits molecular evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in order to track new infections as having arisen from either a control or an intervention group. It enables us to evaluate whether an intervention reduces the number and length of new transmission chains in comparison with a control condition, and thus lets us estimate the relative decrease in new infections in the community due to the intervention. We provide as an example one working scenario of a way the approach can be applied with a simulation study and associated power calculations.

TI Genome-Wide Sequence Analysis of Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus
   Shows Diversification Driven by Recombination
AB Background. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) establishes lifelong infection in the human host and has been associated with a variety of malignancies. KSHV displays striking geographic variation in prevalence, which is highest in sub-Sa-haran Africa. The current KSHV genome sequences available are all tumor cell line-derived or primary tumor-associated viruses, which have provided valuable insights into KSHV genetic diversity.
   Methods. Here, we sequenced 45 KSHV genomes from a Ugandan population cohort in which KSHV is endemic; these are the only genome sequences obtained from nondiseased individuals and of KSHV DNA isolated from saliva.
   Results. Population structure analysis, along with the 25 published genome sequences from other parts of the world, showed whole-genome variation, separating sequences and variation within the central genome contributing to clustering of genomes by geography. We reveal new evidence for the presence of intragenic recombination and multiple recombination events contributing to the divergence of genomes into at least 5 distinct types.
   Discussion. This study shows that large-scale genome-wide sequencing from clinical and epidemiological samples is necessary to capture the full extent of genetic diversity of KSHV, including recombination, and provides evidence to suggest a revision of KSHV genotype nomenclature.

TI Lessons From the West Africa Ebola Epidemic: A Systematic Review of
   Epidemiological and Social and Behavioral Science Research Priorities
AB This systematic literature review compared the epidemiological (EPI) research and the qualitative social and behavioral science (SBS) research published during the West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic. Beginning with an initial capture of over 2000 articles, we extracted 236 EPI and 171 SBS studies to examine how disciplinary priorities affected research conducted during the EVD response, with implications for epidemic response effectiveness. Building on this research, we set forth a roadmap for the closer integration of EPI and SBS research in all aspects of epidemic preparedness and response that incorporates the lessons of the West Africa EVD outbreak. Key priorities include the following: (1) developing the capacity to systematically quantify qualitative sociocultural variables; (2) establishing interdisciplinary collaborations to improve "risk segmentation" practices; (3) creating and prepositioning qualitative indicators and composite sociocultural indexes for rapid deployment in outbreaks; (4) integrating novel systems with community resources; (5) developing new techniques for modeling social mobilization and community engagement; (6) prioritizing good data and complex analyses early in emergencies; and (7) learning from past experiences. Our findings support a program of action that situates data collection and analysis in real-time, recursive, integrated efforts to move community attitudes, behaviors, and responses into epidemiological research. We offer recommendations to improve coordinated, multidisciplinary approaches to health emergencies.

TI NKG2D Regulation of Lung Pathology and Dendritic Cell Function Following
   Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection
AB Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory tract infection in vulnerable populations. Natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DC) are important for the effector functions of both cell types following infection.
   Methods. Wild-type and NKG2D-deficient mice were infected with RSV. Lung pathology was assessed by histology. Dendritic cell function and phenotype were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. The expression of NKG2D ligands on lung and lymph node DCs was measured by immunostaining and flow cytometry. Adoptive transfer experiments were performed to assess the importance of NKG2D-dependent DC function in RSV infection.
   Results. NKG2D-deficient mice exhibited greater lung pathology, marked by the accumulation of DCs following RSV infection. Dendritic cells isolated from NKG2D-deficient mice had impaired responses toward Toll-like receptor ligands. Dendritic cells expressed NKG2D ligands on their surface, which was further increased in NKG2D-deficient mice and during RSV infection. Adoptive transfer of DCs isolated from wild-type mice into the airways of NKG2D-deficient mice ameliorated the enhanced inflammation in NKG2D-deficient mice after RSV infection.
   Conclusion. NKG2D-dependent interactions with DCs control the phenotype and function of DCs and play a critical role in pulmonary host defenses against RSV infection.

TI Untangling the knots: Co-infection and diversity of Bartonella from wild
   gerbils and their associated fleas
AB Based on molecular data, previous studies have suggested a high overall diversity and co-infection rates of Bartonella bacteria in wild rodents and their fleas. However, partial genetic characterization of uncultured co-infecting bacteria limited sound conclusions concerning intra- and inter-specific diversity of the circulating Bartonella. To overcome this limitation, Bartonella infections of wild populations of two sympatric gerbil species and their fleas were explored by multiple isolations of Bartonella organisms. Accordingly, 448 pure Bartonella isolates, obtained from 20 rodent blood and 39 flea samples, were genetically characterized to the genotype and species levels. Results revealed a remarkable diversity and co-infection rates of Bartonella among these sympatric rodents and their associated fleas. Specifically, 38 genotypes, classified into four main Bartonella species, were identified. Co-infection was confirmed in 56% of the samples, which contained two to four Bartonella genotypes per sample, belonging to up to three different species. Recombination within and between these species was demonstrated, serving as a direct evidence of the frequent bacteria-bacteria interactions. Moreover, despite the noticeable interchange of common Bartonella genotypes between rodents and fleas, the co-occurrence of genotypes was not random and differences in the overall diversity, and the ecological and phylogenetic similarities of the infection compositions were significantly associated with the carrier type (rodent vs. flea) and the rodent species. Thus, comprehensive identification of the co-infecting organisms enabled the elucidation of ecological factors affecting the Bartonella distribution among reservoirs and vectors. This study may serve as a model for the investigation of other vector-borne organisms and their relationships with Bartonella.

TI Multiple infections, relatedness and virulence in the anther-smut fungus
   castrating Saponaria plants
AB Multiple infections (co-occurrence of multiple pathogen genotypes within an individual host) can have important impacts on diseases. Relatedness among pathogens can affect the likelihood of multiple infections and their consequences through kin selection. Previous studies on the castrating anther-smut fungus Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae have shown that multiple infections occur in its host plant Silene latifolia. Relatedness was high among fungal genotypes within plants, which could result from competitive exclusion between unrelated fungal genotypes, from population structure or from interactions between plant and fungal genotypes for infection ability. Here, we aimed at disentangling these hypotheses using M. saponariae and its host Saponaria officinalis, both experimentally tractable for these questions. By analysing populations using microsatellite markers, we also found frequent occurrence of multiple infections and high relatedness among strains within host plants. Infections resulting from experimental inoculations in the greenhouse also revealed high relatedness among strains co-infecting host plants, even in clonally replicated plant genotypes, indicating that high relatedness within plants did not result merely from plant x fungus interactions or population structure. Furthermore, hyphal growth in vitro was affected by the presence of a competitor growing nearby and by its genetic similarity, although this latter effect was strain-dependent. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that relatedness-dependent competitive exclusion occurs in Microbotryum fungi within plants. These microorganisms can thus respond to competitors and to their level of relatedness.

TI The role of parasite dispersal in shaping a host-parasite system at
   multiple evolutionary scales
AB Parasite dispersal can shape host-parasite interactions at both deep and shallow timescales. One approach to understanding the effects of dispersal is to study parasite lineages that differ in dispersal capability but are from the same group of hosts. In this study, we compared phylogenetic and population genetic patterns of wing and body lice from ground-doves. Wing lice are more capable of dispersal than body lice. We sequenced full genomes of individual lice for multiple representatives of several wing and body louse species. From these data, we assembled genes for phylogenetic analysis and called SNPs for population genetic analysis. At the phylogenetic level, body lice showed more codivergence with their hosts than did wing lice. However, both wing and body lice exhibited some phylogenetic congruence with their hosts. Within species, body lice showed more population genetic structure than wing lice, although both types of lice showed some structure according to biogeography. Body lice also had significantly lower heterozygosity than wing lice, suggesting more inbreeding. Our results demonstrate that dispersal can shape a host-parasite system across evolutionary time, but also that other factors (e.g., host association and biogeography) can have varying degrees of influence on different groups of parasites and at different evolutionary scales.

TI Holobiont suture zones: Parasite evidence across the European house
   mouse hybrid zone
AB Parasite hybrid zones resulting from host secondary contact have never been described in nature although parasite hybridization is well known and secondary contact should affect them similarly to free-living organisms. When host populations are isolated, diverge and recontact, intimate parasites (host specific, direct life cycle) carried during isolation will also meet and so may form parasite hybrid zones. If so, we hypothesize these should be narrower than the host's hybrid zone as shorter parasite generation time allows potentially higher divergence. We investigate multilocus genetics of two parasites across the European house mouse hybrid zone. We find each host taxon harbours its own parasite taxa. These also hybridize: Parasite hybrid zones are significantly narrower than the host's. Here, we show a host hybrid zone is a suture zone for a subset of its parasite community and highlight the potential of such systems as windows on the evolutionary processes of host-parasite interactions and recombinant pathogen emergence.

TI Virus-virus interactions and host ecology are associated with RNA virome
   structure in wild birds
AB Little is known about the factors that shape the ecology of RNA viruses in nature. Wild birds are an important case in point, as other than influenza A virus, avian samples are rarely tested for viruses, especially in the absence of overt disease. Using bulk RNA-sequencing ("meta-transcriptomics"), we revealed the viral diversity present in Australian wild birds through the lens of the ecological factors that may determine virome structure and abundance. A meta-transcriptomic analysis of four Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes (shorebird) species sampled in temperate and arid Australia revealed the presence of 27 RNA virus genomes, 18 of which represent newly described species. The viruses identified included a previously described gammacoronavirus and influenza A viruses. Additionally, we identified novel virus species from the families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae. We noted differences in virome structure that reflected underlying differences in location and influenza A infection status. Red-necked Avocets (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) from Australia's arid interior possessed the greatest viral diversity and abundance, markedly higher than individuals sampled in temperate Australia. In Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and dabbling ducks (Anas spp.), viral abundance and diversity were higher and more similar in hosts that were positive for influenza A infection compared to those that were negative for this virus, despite samples being collected on the same day and from the same location. This study highlights the extent and diversity of RNA viruses in wild birds and lays the foundation for understanding the factors that determine virome structure in wild populations.

TI Full-Length Envelope Analyzer (FLEA): A tool for longitudinal analysis
   of viral amplicons
AB Next generation sequencing of viral populations has advanced our understanding of viral population dynamics, the development of drug resistance, and escape from host immune responses. Many applications require complete gene sequences, which can be impossible to reconstruct from short reads. HIV env, the protein of interest for HIV vaccine studies, is exceptionally challenging for long-read sequencing and analysis due to its length, high substitution rate, and extensive indel variation. While long-read sequencing is attractive in this setting, the analysis of such data is not well handled by existing methods. To address this, we introduce FLEA (Full-Length Envelope Analyzer), which performs end-to-end analysis and visualization of long-read sequencing data. FLEA consists of both a pipeline (optionally run on a high-performance cluster), and a client-side web application that provides interactive results. The pipeline transforms FASTQ reads into high-quality consensus sequences (HQCSs) and uses them to build a codon-aware multiple sequence alignment. The resulting alignment is then used to infer phylogenies, selection pressure, and evolutionary dynamics. The web application provides publication-quality plots and interactive visualizations, including an annotated viral alignment browser, time series plots of evolutionary dynamics, visualizations of gene-wide selective pressures (such as dN/dS) across time and across protein structure, and a phylogenetic tree browser. We demonstrate how FLEA may be used to process Pacific Biosciences HIV env data and describe recent examples of its use. Simulations show how FLEA dramatically reduces the error rate of this sequencing platform, providing an accurate portrait of complex and variable HIV env populations. A public instance of FLEA is hosted at http://flea.datamonkey.org. The Python source code for the FLEA pipeline can be found at https://github.com/veg/flea-pipeline. The client-side application is available at https://github.com/veg/flea-web-app. A live demo of the P018 results can be found at http://flea.murrell.group/view/P018.

TI Hosts mobility and spatial spread of Rickettsia rickettsii
AB There are a huge number of pathogens with multi-component transmission cycles, involving amplifier hosts, vectors or complex pathogen life cycles. These complex systems present challenges in terms of modeling and policy development. A lethal tick-borne infectious disease, the Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF), is a relevant example of that. The current increase of human cases of BSF has been associated with the presence and expansion of the capy-bara Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, amplifier host for the agent Rickettsia rickettsii and primary host for the tick vector Amblyomma sculptum. We introduce a stochastic dynamical model that captures the spatial distribution of capybaras and ticks to gain a better understanding of the spatial spread of the R. rickettsii and potentially predict future epidemic outcomes. We implemented a reaction-diffusion process in which individuals were divided into classes denoting their state with respect to the disease. The model considered bidirectional movements between base and destination locations limited by the carrying capacity of the environment. We performed systematic stochastic simulations and numerical analysis of the model and investigate the impact of potential interventions to mitigate the spatial spread of the disease. The mobility of capybaras and their attached ticks was significantly influenced by the birth rate of capybaras and therefore, disease propagation velocity was higher in places with higher carrying capacity. Some geographical barriers, generated for example by riparian reforesting, can impede the spatial spread of BSF. The results of this work will allow the formulation of public actions focused on the prevention of BSF human cases.

TI General contextual effects on neglected tropical disease risk in rural
   Kenya
AB The neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are characterized by their tendency to cluster within groups of people, typically the poorest and most marginalized. Despite this, measures of clustering, such as within-group correlation or between-group heterogeneity, are rarely reported from community-based studies of NTD risk. We describe a general contextual analysis that uses multi-level models to partition and quantify variation in individual NTD risk at multiple grouping levels in rural Kenya. The importance of general contextual effects (GCE) in structuring variation in individual infection with Schistosoma mansoni, the soil-transmitted helminths, Taenia species, and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar was examined at the household-, sublocation- and constituency-levels using variance partition/intra-class correlation co-efficients and median odds ratios. These were compared with GCE for HIV, Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The role of place of residence in shaping infection risk was further assessed using the spatial scan statistic. Individuals from the same household showed correlation in infection for all pathogens, and this was consistently highest for the gastrointestinal helminths. The lowest levels of household clustering were observed for E. histolytica/dispar, P. falciparum and M. tuberculosis. Substantial heterogeneity in individual infection risk was observed between sublocations for S. mansoni and Taenia solium cysticercosis and between constituencies for infection with S. mansoni, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides. Large overlapping spatial clusters were detected for S. mansoni, T. trichiura, A. lumbricoides, and Taenia spp., which overlapped a large cluster of elevated HIV risk. Important place-based heterogeneities in infection risk exist in this community, and these GCEs are greater for the NTDs and HIV than for TB and malaria. Our findings suggest that broad-scale contextual drivers shape infectious disease risk in this population, but these effects operate at different grouping-levels for different pathogens. A general contextual analysis can provide a foundation for understanding the complex ecology of NTDs and contribute to the targeting of interventions

TI Ticks as potential vectors of Mycobacterium leprae: Use of tick cell
   lines to culture the bacilli and generate transgenic strains
AB Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and frequently resulting in irreversible deformities and disabilities. Ticks play an important role in infectious disease transmission due to their low host specificity, worldwide distribution, and the biological ability to support transovarial transmission of a wide spectrum of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. To investigate a possible role for ticks as vectors of leprosy, we assessed transovarial transmission of M. leprae in artificially-fed adult female Amblyomma sculptum ticks, and infection and growth of M. leprae in tick cell lines. Our results revealed M. leprae RNA and antigens persisting in the midgut and present in the ovaries of adult female A. sculptum at least 2 days after oral infection, and present in their progeny (eggs and larvae), which demonstrates the occurrence of transovarial transmission of this pathogen. Infected tick larvae were able to inoculate viable bacilli during blood-feeding on a rabbit. Moreover, following inoculation with M. leprae, the Ixodes scapularis embryo-derived tick cell line IDE8 supported a detectable increase in the number of bacilli for at least 20 days, presenting a doubling time of approximately 12 days. As far as we know, this is the first in vitro cellular system able to promote growth of M. leprae. Finally, we successfully transformed a clinical M. leprae isolate by inserting the reporter plasmid pCHERRY3; transformed bacteria infected and grew in IDE8 cells over a 2-month period. Taken together, our data not only support the hypothesis that ticks may have the potential to act as a reservoir and/or vector of leprosy, but also suggest the feasibility of technological development of tick cell lines as a tool for large-scale production of M. leprae bacteria, as well as describing for the first time a method for their transformation.

TI Using physical contact heterogeneity and frequency to characterize
   dynamics of human exposure to nonhuman primate bodily fluids in central
   Africa
AB Emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin constitute a recurrent threat to global health. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) occupy an important place in zoonotic spillovers (pathogenic transmissions from animals to humans), serving as reservoirs or amplifiers of multiple neglected tropical diseases, including viral hemorrhagic fevers and arboviruses, parasites and bacteria, as well as retroviruses (simian foamy virus, PTLV) that are pathogenic in human beings. Hunting and butchering studies in Africa characterize at-risk human social groups, but overlook critical factors of contact heterogeneity and frequency, NHP species differences, and meat processing practices. In southeastern Cameroon, a region with a history of zoonotic emergence and high risk of future spillovers, we conducted a novel mixed-method field study of human physical exposure to multiple NHP species, incorporating participant-based and ecological methodologies, and qualitative interviews (n = 25). We find frequent physical contact across adult human populations, greater physical contact with monkeys than apes, especially for meat handling practices, and positive correlation of human exposure with NHP species abundance and proximity to human settlement. These fine-grained results encourage reconsideration of the likely dynamics of human-NHP contact in past and future NTD emergence events. Multidisciplinary social science and ecological approaches should be mobilized to generate more effective human and animal surveillance and risk communications around neglected tropical diseases. At a moment when the WHO has included "Disease X", a presumably zoonotic pathogen with pandemic potential, on its list of blueprint priority diseases as, new field-based tools for investigating zoonotic disease emergence, both known and unknown, are of critical importance.

TI Asymptomatic carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae detected by qPCR on
   the palm of hands of populations in rural Senegal
AB Aside from malaria, infectious diseases are an important cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa and continue to pose major public health problems in African countries, notably pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia in all age groups. The skin is one of the main infection sites followed by the oropharynx. The skin carriage of certain pathogenic bacteria such as S. pneumoniae is often ignored or under-diagnosed. Finally, the mode of transmission of these infections remains uncertain. Here, we hypothesized that skin could play a role in the transmission of these infections. We collected 649 cotton swabs from a healthy population in Dielmo and Ndiop, rural Senegal. The sampling was carried out on the palm of the hands. After DNA extraction and actin control, qPCR targeting eight different bacteria was performed on 614 skin samples. We detected Streptococcus pneumoniae in 33.06% (203/614), Staphylococcus aureus in 18.08% (111/614) and Streptococcus pyogenes in 1.95% (12/614) of samples. A skin S. pneumoniae carriage was detected in more than a third of a rural population in rural Africa, highlighting the need to develop hand disinfection programs in order to reduce the burden of infections.

TI Robustness of the reproductive number estimates in vector-borne disease
   systems
AB Background
   The required efforts, feasibility and predicted success of an intervention strategy against an infectious disease are partially determined by its basic reproduction number, R-0. In its simplest form R-0 can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector transmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector's life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R-0 for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R-0 estimates.
   Methodology and principal findings
   Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R-0 by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R-0 formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions.
   Conclusion
   Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and general epidemiology of vector transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the disease's reproduction number. Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more realistic intervention impact predictions.

TI Widespread circulation of West Nile virus, but not Zika virus in
   southern Iran
AB West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are mosquito-borne viral infections. Over the past few decades, WNV has been associated with several outbreaks involving high numbers of neuroinvasive diseases among humans. The recent re-emergence of ZIKV has been associated with congenital malformation and also with Guillain Barre syndrome in adults. The geographic range of arthropod-borne viruses has been rapidly increasing in recent years. The objectives of this study were to determine the presence of IgG specific antibodies and the genome of WNV and ZIKV in human samples, as well as WNV and ZIKV genomes in wild-caught mosquitoes in urban and rural areas of the Hormozgan province, in southern Iran. A total of 494 serum samples were tested for the presence of WNV and ZIKV IgG antibodies using ELISA assays. One hundred and two (20.6%) samples were reactive for WNV IgG antibodies. All serum samples were negative for ZIKV IgG antibodies. Using the multivariable logistic analysis, age (45+vs. 1-25; OR = 3.4, 95% C.I.: 1.8-6.3), occupation (mostly outdoor vs. mostly indoor; OR = 2.4, 95% C.I.: 1.1-5.2), and skin type(type I/II vs. type III/IV and type VNI; OR = 4.3, 95% C.I.: 1.7-10.8 and OR = 2.7, 95% C.I.: 1.3-5.5 respectively, skin types based on Fitzpatrick scale) showed significant association with WNV seroreactivity. We collected 2,015 mosquitoes in 136 pools belonging to 5 genera and 14 species. Three pools of Culex pipiens complex were positive for WNV RNA using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR). ZIKV RNA was not detected in any of the pools. All WNV ELISA reactive serum samples were negative for WNV RNA. In conclusion, we provided evidence of the establishment of WNV in southern Iran and no proof of ZIKV in serum samples or in mosquito vectors. The establishment of an organized arbovirus surveillance system and active case finding strategies seems to be necessary.

TI Zoonotic Source Attribution of Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhimurium
   Using Genomic Surveillance Data, United States
AB Increasingly, routine surveillance and monitoring of foodborne pathogens using whole-genome sequencing is creating opportunities to study foodborne illness epidemiology beyond routine outbreak investigations and case-control studies. Using a global phylogeny of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, we found that major livestock sources of the pathogen in the United States can be predicted through whole-genome sequencing data. Relatively steady rates of sequence divergence in livestock lineages enabled the inference of their recent origins. Elevated accumulation of lineage-specific pseudogenes after divergence from generalist populations and possible metabolic acclimation in a representative swine isolate indicates possible emergence of host adaptation. We developed and retrospectively applied a machine learning Random Forest classifier for genomic source prediction of Salmonella Typhimurium that correctly attributed 7 of 8 major zoonotic outbreaks in the United States during 1998-2013. We further identified 50 key genetic features that were sufficient for robust livestock source prediction.

TI Sexual Conflict and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs): Coevolution
   of Sexually Antagonistic Host Traits with an STI
AB In many taxa, there is a conflict between the sexes over mating rate. The outcome of sexually antagonistic coevolution depends on the costs of mating and natural selection against sexually antagonistic traits. A sexually transmitted infection (STI) changes the relative strength of these costs. We study the three-way evolutionary interaction among male persistence, female resistance, and STI virulence for two types of STIs: a viability-reducing STI and a reproduction-reducing STI. A viability-reducing STI escalates conflict between the sexes. This leads to increased STI virulence (i.e., full coevolution) if the costs of sexually antagonistic traits occur through viability but not through reproduction. In contrast, a reproduction-reducing STI de-escalates the sexual conflict, but STI virulence does not coevolve in response. We also investigated the establishment probability of STIs under different combinations of evolvability. Successful invasion by a viability-reducing STI becomes less likely if hosts (but not parasites) are evolvable, especially if only the female trait can evolve. A reproduction-reducing STI can almost always invade because it does not kill its host. We discuss how the evolution of host and parasite traits in a system with sexual conflict differs from a system with female mate choice.

TI Frequency of virus-resistant hosts determines experimental community
   dynamics
AB Parasites, such as bacterial viruses (phages), can have large effects on host populations both at the ecological and evolutionary levels. In the case of cyanobacteria, phages can reduce primary production and infected hosts release intracellular nutrients influencing planktonic food web structure, community dynamics, and biogeochemical cycles. Cyanophages may be of great importance in aquatic food webs during large cyanobacterial blooms unless the host population becomes resistant to phage infection. The consequences on plankton community dynamics of the evolution of phage resistance in bloom forming cyanobacterial populations are still poorly studied. Here, we examined the effect of different frequencies of a phage-resistant genotype within a filamentous nitrogen-fixing Nodularia spumigena population on an experimental plankton community. Three Nodularia populations with different initial frequencies (0%, 5%, and 50%) of phage-resistant genotypes were inoculated in separate treatments with the phage 2AV2, the green alga Chlorella vulgaris, and the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, which formed the experimental plankton community subjected to either nitrogen-limited or nitrogen-rich conditions. We found that the frequency of the phage-resistant Nodularia genotype determined experimental community dynamics. Cyanobacterial populations with a high frequency (50%) of the phage-resistant genotype dominated the cultures despite the presence of phages, retaining most of the intracellular nitrogen in the plankton community. In contrast, populations with low frequencies (0% and 5%) of the phage-resistant genotype were lysed and reduced to extinction by the phage, transferring the intracellular nitrogen held by Nodularia to Chlorella and rotifers, and allowing Chlorella to dominate the communities and rotifers to survive. This study shows that even though phages represent minuscule biomass, they can have key effects on community composition and eco-evolutionary feedbacks in plankton communities.

TI Bottom-up trait-mediated indirect effects decrease pathogen transmission
   in a tritrophic system
AB A plant's induction of secondary defenses helps to decrease herbivore damage by changing resource quality. While these chemical or physical defenses may directly decrease herbivory, they can also have indirect consequences. In a tritrophic system consisting of a plant, an insect herbivore, and an insect pathogen, plant based trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs) can alter host-pathogen interactions and, thereby, indirectly affect disease transmission. In a series of field experiments, individual soybean plants (Glycine max) were sprayed with either a jasmonic acid (JA) solution to trigger induction of plant defenses or a similar control compound. Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) larvae along with varying amounts of a lethal baculovirus were placed on the plants to measure transmission. Induction of plant defenses decreased viral transmission due to increased population heterogeneity arising from changes in individual susceptibility. The change in susceptibility via TMIEs was driven by a decrease in feeding rates and an increase viral dose needed to infect larvae. While the induction against herbivore attack may decrease herbivory, it can also decrease the efficacy of the herbivore's pathogen potentially to the plant's detriment. While TMIEs have been well-recognized for being driven by top-down forces, bottom-up interactions can dictate community dynamics and, here, epizootic severity.

TI Evidence of Self-Medication with Chloroquine before Consultation for
   Malaria in the Southern Pacific Coast Region of Colombia
AB Self-medication with antimalarial drugs is a major factor in the development of drug resistance, exerting subtherapeutic drug pressure on circulating parasite populations. Data on self-medication with antimalarials from the Southern Pacific coast region of Colombia, where 4-aminoquinolines resistance and political instability prevail, are vital to elimination strategies. Wepresent results of an exploratory study of 254 individuals having malaria symptoms who sought malaria diagnosis in two hospitals in Tumaco, Department of Narino, Colombia. Thirty-two percent (82/254) of participants had positive Saker-Solomons urine tests, indicating self-medication with chloroquine (CQ) before consultation for diagnosis. Notably, among 30 pregnant women participating in the study, 43% were Saker-Solomons positive. Molecular analysis of the K76T position encoded by the pfcrt gene revealed the mutant allele in all four samples that were both positive for Plasmodium falciparum and positive for the Saker-Solomons test, suggesting persistent CQ pressure. The high frequency of self-medication, particularly among pregnant women merits attention by public health authorities and comprehensive investigation.

TI The slow dynamics of mycoplasma infections in a tortoise host reveal
   heterogeneity pertinent to pathogen transmission and monitoring
AB The epidemiology of infectious diseases depends on many characteristics of disease progression, as well as the consistency of these processes across hosts. Longitudinal studies of infection can thus inform disease monitoring and management, but can be challenging in wildlife, particularly for long-lived hosts and persistent infections. Numerous tortoise species of conservation concern can be infected by pathogenic mycoplasmas that cause a chronic upper respiratory tract disease (URTD). Yet, a lack of detailed data describing tortoise responses to mycoplasma infections obscures our understanding of URTDs role in host ecology. We therefore monitored Mycoplasma agassizii infections in 14 captive desert tortoises and characterised clinical signs of disease, infection intensity, pathogen shedding and antibody production for nearly 4 years after initial exposure to donor hosts. Persistent infections established in all exposed tortoises within 10 weeks, but hosts appeared to vary in resistance, which affected the patterns of pathogen shedding and apparent disease. Delays in host immune response and changes to clinical signs and infection intensity over time resulted in inconsistencies between diagnostic tools and changes in diagnostic accuracy throughout the study. We discuss the implications these results have for URTD epidemiology and past and future research assessing disease prevalence and dynamics in tortoise populations.

TI Global spatial assessment of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus: a
   scenario of Zika virus exposure
AB Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Recent scientific evidence on Culex quinquefasciatus has suggested its potential as a vector for ZIKV, which may change the current risk zones. We aimed to quantify the world population potentially exposed to ZIKV in a spatially explicit way, considering the primary vector (A. aegypti) and the potential vector (C. quinquefasciatus). Our model combined species distribution modelling of mosquito species with spatially explicit human population data to estimate ZIKV exposure risk. We estimated the potential global distribution of C. quinquefasciatus and estimated its potential interaction zones with A. aegypti. Then we evaluated the risk zones for ZIKV considering both vectors. Finally, we quantified and compared the people under risk associated with each vector by risk level, country and continent. We found that C. quinquefasciatus had a more temperate distribution until 42 degrees in both hemispheres, while the risk involving A. aegypti is concentrated mainly in tropical latitudes until 35 degrees in both hemispheres. Globally, 4.2 billion people are under risk associated with ZIKV. Around 2.6 billon people are under very high risk associated with C. quinquefasciatus and 1 billion people associated with A. aegypti. Several countries could be exposed to ZIKV, which emphasises the need to clarify the competence of C. quinquefasciatus as a potential vector as soon as possible. The models presented here represent a tool for risk management, public health planning, mosquito control and preventive actions, especially to focus efforts on the most affected areas.

TI Temporal dynamics of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the
   Arabian Peninsula, 2012-2017
AB Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains a notable disease and poses a significant threat to global public health. The Arabian Peninsula is considered a major global epicentre for the disease and the virus has crossed regional and continental boundaries since 2012. In this study, we focused on exploring the temporal dynamics of MERS-CoV in human populations in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2017, using publicly available data on case counts and combining two analytical methods. Disease progression was assessed by quantifying the time-dependent reproductive number (TD-Rs), while case series temporal pattern was modelled using the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We accounted for geographical variability between three major affected regions in Saudi Arabia including Eastern Province, Riyadh and Makkah. In Saudi Arabia, the epidemic size was large with TD-Rs > 1, indicating significant spread until 2017. In both Makkah and Riyadh regions, the epidemic progression reached its peak in April 2014 (TD-Rs > 7), during the highest incidence period of MERS-CoV cases. In Eastern Province, one unique super-spreading event (TD-R > 10) was identified in May 2013, which comprised of the most notable cases of human-to-human transmission. Best-fitting ARIMA model inferred statistically significant biannual seasonality in Riyadh region, a region characterised by heavy seasonal camel-related activities. However, no statistical evidence of seasonality was identified in Eastern Province and Makkah. Instead, both areas were marked by an endemic pattern of cases with sporadic outbreaks. Our study suggested new insights into the epidemiology of the virus, including inferences about epidemic progression and evidence for seasonality. Despite the inherent limitations of the available data, our conclusions provide further guidance to currently implement risk-based surveillance in high-risk populations and, subsequently, improve related interventions strategies against the epidemic at country and regional levels.

TI The fall and rise of Group A Streptococcus diseases
AB Streptococcus pyogenes (or Group A Streptococcus, GAS) is a Gram-positive human pathogen responsible for a diverse array of superficial, invasive and immune-related diseases. GAS infections have historically been diseases of poverty and overcrowding, and remain a significant problem in the developing world and in disadvantaged populations within developed countries. With improved living conditions and access to antibiotics, the rates of GAS diseases in developed societies have gradually declined during the 20th century. However, genetic changes in circulating GAS strains and/or changes in host susceptibility to infection can lead to dramatic increases in the rates of specific diseases. No situations exemplify this more than the global upsurge of invasive GAS disease that originated in the 1980s and the regional increases in scarlet fever in north-east Asia and the UK. In each case, increased disease rates have been associated with the emergence of new GAS strains with increased disease-causing capability. Global surveillance for new GAS strains with increased virulence is important and determining why certain populations suddenly become susceptible to circulating strains remains a research priority. Here, we overview the changing epidemiology of GAS infections and the genetic alterations that accompany the emergence of GAS strains with increased capacity to cause disease.

TI An outbreak of norovirus infection caused by ice cubes and a leaking air
   ventilation valve
AB A gastrointestinal outbreak was reported among 154 diners who attended a Christmas buffet on the 9 and 10 December 2016. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken. Faecal samples, water, ice and an air ventilation device were tested for indicators and routine pathogens. Altogether 26% (24/91) fulfilled the case definition of having typical viral gastrointestinal symptoms. Norovirus genogroup I was detected in faecal samples from three cases. One of these cases tested positive also for sapovirus and had a family member testing positive for both norovirus and sapovirus. A diner who drank water or drinks with ice cubes (risk ratios (RR) 6.5, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.5-113.0) or both (RR 8.2, 95% CI 1.7-145.5) had an increased risk in a dose-response manner. Ice cubes from three vending machines had high levels of heterotrophic bacteria. A faulty air ventilation valve in the space where the ice cube machine was located was considered a likely cause of this outbreak. Leaking air ventilation valves may represent a neglected route of transmission in viral gastrointestinal outbreaks.

TI Compartmental models for seasonal hyperendemic bacterial meningitis in
   the African meningitis belt
AB The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the seasonal dynamic and epidemic occurrence of bacterial meningitis in the African meningitis belt remain unknown. Regular seasonality (seasonal hyperendemicity) is observed for both meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis and understanding this is critical for better prevention and modelling. The two principal hypotheses for hyperendemicity during the dry season imply (1) an increased risk of invasive disease given asymptomatic carriage of meningococci and pneumococci; or (2) an increased transmission of these bacteria from carriers and ill individuals. In this study, we formulated three compartmental deterministic models of seasonal hyperendemicity, featuring one (model1-'inv' or model2-'transm'), or a combination (model3-'inv-transm') of the two hypotheses. We parameterised the models based on current knowledge on meningococcal and pneumococcal biology and pathophysiology. We compared the three models' performance in reproducing weekly incidences of suspected cases of acute bacterial meningitis reported by health centres in Burkina Faso during 2004-2010, through the meningitis surveillance system. The three models performed well (coefficient of determination R-2, 0.72, 0.86 and 0.87, respectively). Model2-'transm' and model3-'inv-transm' better captured the amplitude of the seasonal incidence. However, model2-'transm' required a higher constant invasion rate for a similar average baseline transmission rate. The results suggest that a combination of seasonal changes of the risk of invasive disease and carriage transmission is involved in the hyperendemic seasonality of bacterial meningitis in the African meningitis belt. Consequently, both interventions reducing the risk of nasopharyngeal invasion and the bacteria transmission, especially during the dry season are believed to be needed to limit the recurrent seasonality of bacterial meningitis in the meningitis belt.

TI The incidence of symptomatic infection with influenza virus in the
   Netherlands 2011/2012 through 2016/2017, estimated using Bayesian
   evidence synthesis
AB Due to differences in the circulation of influenza viruses, distribution and antigenic drift of A subtypes and B lineages, and susceptibility to infection in the population, the incidence of symptomatic influenza infection can vary widely between seasons and age-groups. Our goal was to estimate the symptomatic infection incidence in the Netherlands for the six seasons 2011/2012 through 2016/2017, using Bayesian evidence synthesis methodology to combine season-specific sentinel surveillance data on influenza-like illness (ILI), virus detections in sampled ILI cases and data on healthcare-seeking behaviour. Estimated age-aggregated incidence was 6.5 per 1000 persons (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 4.7-9.0) for season 2011/2012, 36.7 (95% UI: 31.2-42.8) for 2012/2013, 9.1 (95% UI: 6.3-12.9) for 2013/2014, 41.1 (95% UI: 35.0-47.7) for 2014/2015, 39.4 (95% UI: 33.4-46.1) for 2015/2016 and 27.8 (95% UI: 22.7-33.7) for season 2016/2017. Incidence varied substantially between age-groups (highest for the age-group <5 years: 23 to 47/1000, but relatively low for 65+ years: 2 to 34/1000 over the six seasons). Integration of all relevant data sources within an evidence synthesis framework has allowed the estimation - with appropriately quantified uncertainty - of the incidence of symptomatic influenza virus infection. These estimates provide valuable insight into the variation in influenza epidemics across seasons, by virus subtype and lineage, and between age-groups.

TI Evolutionary stability of the lysis-lysogeny decision: Why be virulent?
AB Lytic viruses infect and kill host cells, producing a large number of viral copies. Temperate viruses, in contrast, are able to integrate viral genetic material into the host cell DNA, leaving a viable host cell. The evolutionary advantage of this strategy, lysogeny, has been demonstrated in complex environments that include spatial structure, oscillating population dynamics, or periodic environmental collapse. Here, we examine the evolutionary stability of the lysis-lysogeny decision, that is, we predict the long-term outcome of the evolution of lysogeny rates. We demonstrate that viruses with high rates of lysogeny are stable against invasion by more virulent viral strains even in simple environments, as long as the pool of susceptible hosts is not unlimited. This mirrors well-known results in both r-K selection theory and virulence evolution: although virulent viruses have a faster potential growth rate, temperate strains are able to maintain positive growth on a lower density of the limiting resource, susceptible hosts. We then outline scenarios in which the rate of lysogeny is predicted to evolve either toward full lysogeny or full lysis. Finally, we demonstrate conditions under which intermediate rates of lysogeny, as observed in temperate viruses in nature, can be sustained long-term. In general, intermediate lysogeny rates persist when the coupling between susceptible host density and virus density is relaxed.

TI Reduced skin bacterial diversity correlates with increased pathogen
   infection intensity in an endangered amphibian host
AB The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infects the skin of amphibians and has caused severe declines and extinctions of amphibians globally. In this study, we investigate the interaction between Bd and the bacterial skin microbiome of the endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog, Rana sierrae, using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Samples were collected from two populations of R. sierrae that likely underwent Bd epizootics in the past, but that continue to persist with Bd in an enzootic disease state, and we address the hypothesis that such "persistent" populations are aided by mutualistic skin microbes. Our 16S rRNA metabarcoding data reveal that the skin microbiome of highly infected juvenile frogs is characterized by significantly reduced species richness and evenness, and by strikingly lower variation between individuals, compared to juveniles and adults with lower infection levels. Over 90% of DNA sequences from the skin microbiome of highly infected frogs were derived from bacteria in a single order, Burkholderiales, compared to just 54% in frogs with lower infection levels. In a culture-dependent Bd inhibition assay, the bacterial metabolites we evaluated all inhibited the growth of Bd. Together, these results illustrate the disruptive effects of Bd infection on host skin microbial community structure and dynamics, and suggest possible avenues for the development of anti-Bd probiotic treatments.

TI Population genetic structure and geographical variation in Neotricula
   aperta (Gastropoda: Pomatiopsidae), the snail intermediate host of
   Schistosoma mekongi (Digenea: Schistosomatidae)
AB Background Neotricula aperta is the snail-intermediate host of the parasitic blood-fluke Schistosoma mekongi which causes Mekong schistosomiasis in Cambodia and the Lao PDR. Despite numerous phylogenetic studies only one DNA-sequence based population-genetic study of N. aperta had been published, and the origin, structure and persistence of N. aperta were poorly understood. Consequently, a phylogenetic and population genetic study was performed, with addition of new data to pre-existing DNA-sequences for N. aperta from remote and inaccessible habitats, including one new taxon from Laos and 505 bp of additional DNA-sequence for all sampled taxa,.
   Principal findings Spatial Principal Component Analysis revealed the presence of significant spatial-genetic clustering. Genetic-distance-based clustering indicated four populations with near perfect match to a priori defined ecogeographical regions. Spring-dwelling taxa were found to form an ecological isolate relative to other N. aperta. The poor dispersal capabilities suggested by spatial-genetic analyses were confirmed by Bayesian inference of migration rates. Population divergence time estimation implied a mid-Miocene colonisation of the present range, with immediate and rapid radiation in each ecogeographical region. Estimated effective population sizes were large (120-310 thousand).
   Conclusions The strong spatial-genetic structure confirmed the poor dispersal capabilities of N. apertasuggesting human-mediated reintroduction of disease to controlled areas as the primary reason for control failure. The isolation of the spring-dwelling taxa and ecogeographical structure suggests adaptation of sub-populations to different habitats; the epidemiological significance of this needs investigation. The large effective population sizes indicate that the high population densities observed in surveyed habitats are also present in inaccessible areas; affording great potential for recrudescence driven by animal-reservoir transmission in remote streams. Mid-Miocene colonisation implies heterochronous evolution of these snails and associated schistosomes and suggests against coevolution of snail and parasite. Heterochronicity favours ecological factors as shapers of host-parasite specificity and greater potential for escape from schistosomiasis control through host-switching.
   Author summary The disease Mekong schistosomiasis poses a threat to the health of about 1.5 million people living near the Mekong river and its tributaries in Cambodia and Laos. It is a water-borne parasite transmitted by direct contact with water in which freshwater snails of the species Neotricula aperta live. Control of the snails is an effective approach to control of the parasite; however, because many suitable habitats for N. aperta occur in remote and inaccessible areas, knowledge of N. aperta population sizes and interconnectivity is insufficient for the design of effective snail control interventions. Although much of the region is difficult to survey by conventional means, population genetics can be used to estimate population structure and total size from small samples of accessible populations. The study added to existing data-sets, to give more population samples and longer DNA-sequences, together with improved analytical approaches to provide a better overview of N. aperta. The findings suggest that N. aperta in different kinds of habitats are also genetically different, with very low levels of migration between them; this genetic clustering is greater than expected from spatial distance alone. Further work is needed to determine if these different clusters vary in ability to transmit the parasite. The overall population size estimates were very large; thus suggesting that high snail population densities observed in accessible habitats are also characteristic of inaccessible populationsparasites are therefore more likely to return after disease control by immigration from remote areas. Finally, the timing of evolutionary events for snails and parasites was found to differ; this implies that the parasite may not be as strongly restricted to one species of snail as originally thought, which has implications for avoidance of parasite control by host-switching.

TI Surface molecules of extracellular vesicles secreted by the helminth
   pathogen Fasciola hepatica direct their internalisation by host cells
AB Helminth parasites secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be internalised by host immune cells resulting in modulation of host immunity. While the molecular cargo of EVs have been characterised in many parasites, little is known about the surface-exposed molecules that participate in ligand-receptor interactions with the host cell surface to initiate vesicle docking and subsequent internalisation. Using a membrane-impermeable biotin reagent to capture proteins displayed on the outer membrane surface of two EV sub-populations (termed 15k and 120k EVs) released by adult F. hepatica, we describe 380 surface proteins including an array of virulence factors, membrane transport proteins and molecules involved in EV biogenesis/trafficking. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis show that the 120k EVs have an endosomal origin and may be released from the parasite via the protonephridial (excretory) system whilst the larger 15k EVs are released from the gastrodermal epithelial cells that line the fluke gut. A parallel lectin microarray strategy was used to profile the topology of major surface oligosaccharides of intact fluorogenically-labelled EVs as they would be displayed to the host. Lectin profiles corresponding to glycoconjugates exposed on the surface of the 15 K and 120K EV sub-populations are practically identical but are distinct from those of the parasite surface tegument, although all are predominated by high mannose sugars. We found that while the F. hepatica EVs were resistant to exo- and endo-glycosidases, the glyco-amidase PNGase F drastically remodelled the surface oligosaccharides and blocked the uptake of EVs by host macrophages. In contrast, pre-treatment with antibodies obtained from infected hosts, or purified antibodies raised against the extracellular domains of specific EV surface proteins (DM9-containing protein, CD63 receptor and myoferlin), significantly enhanced their cellular internalisation. This work highlights the diversity of EV biogenesis and trafficking pathways used by F. hepatica and sheds light on the molecular interaction between parasite EVs and host cells.
   Author summary Over the last decade, it has become recognised that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important mediators of communication by transferring molecular signals (including proteins, lipids, complex carbohydrates, mRNA, microRNA and other non-coding RNA species), between cells. Variously described as exosomes or microvesicles depending on their cellular origin and mode of biogenesis, EVs perform a variety of roles in the maintenance of normal physiology but also participate in pathological settings. EVs also play an important role in host-pathogen interactions, with recent work suggesting that they contribute to helminth immunomodulatory strategies. Here we have identified the proteins and sugars displayed on the outer surface of two sub-types of EVs released by the helminth pathogen Fasciola hepatica. We show that the proteins are antigenic and direct EV internalisation by host macrophages. Our study provides a better understanding of how parasite-derived EVs interact with host cells which is important for future development of therapeutics/vaccines that target this interface.

TI Epidemiology of West Nile Virus in the Eastern Mediterranean region: A
   systematic review
AB Background West Nile Virus (WNV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, is one of the most widely distributed arboviruses in the world. Despite some evidence for circulation of WNV in countries summarized by the World Health Organization as the Eastern Mediterrian Region Office (EMRO), comprehensive knowledge about its epidemiology remains largely unknown. This study aims to provide a concise review of the published literature on WNV infections in the Eastern Mediterranean regional office of WHO (EMRO).
   Methodology/principal findings A systematic review of WNV prevalence studies on humans, animals and vectors in the EMRO region was performed by searching: Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar. Finally, 77 citations were included, comprising 35 seroprevalence studies on general population (24460 individuals), 15 prevalence studies among patients (3439 individuals), 22 seroprevalence studies among animals (10309 animals), and 9 studies on vectors (184242 vector species). Of the 22 countries in this region, five had no data on WNV infection among different populations. These countries include Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Syria and Somalia. On the other hand, among countries with available data, WNV-specific antibodies were detected in the general population of all investigated countries including Djibouti (0.3-60%), Egypt (1-61%), Iran (0-30%), Iraq (11.6-15.1%), Jordan (8%), Lebanon (0.5-1%), Libya (2.3%), Morocco (0-18.8%), Pakistan (0.6-65.0%), Sudan (2.2-47%), and Tunisia (4.3-31.1%). WNV RNA were also detected in patient populations of Iran (1.2%), Pakistan (33.3%), and Tunisia (5.3% -15.9%). WNV-specific antibodies were also detected in a wide range of animal species. The highest seropositivity rate was observed among equids (100% in Morocco) and dogs (96% in Morocco). The highest seroprevalence among birds was seen in Tunisia (23%). In addition, WNV infection was detected in mosquitoes (Culex, and Aedes) and ticks (Argas reflexus hermanni). The primary vector of WNV (Culex pipiens s.l.) was detected in Djibouti, Egypt, Iran and Tunisia, and in mosquitoes of all these countries, WNV was demonstrated.
   Conclusions This first systematic regional assessment of WNV prevalence provides evidence to support the circulation of WNV in the EMRO region as nearly all studies showed evidence of WNV infection in human as well as animal/vector populations. These findings highlight the need for continued prevention and control strategies and the collection of epidemiologic data for WNV epidemic status, especially in countries that lack reliable surveillance systems.
   Author summary West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, which is endemic in a vast geographical area, including the EMRO region. However, the epidemiology of WNV in the EMRO region remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we performed a systematic review on WNV prevalence studies conducted on human populations, animals and vectors across Eastern Mediterranean countries. Our review indicated the infection of most investigated human, animal and vector populations with WNV; however, the paucity of epidemiological data underline the need for integrated surveillance programs as well as continued deployment of prevention and control strategies.

TI A novel cell-free method to culture Schistosoma mansoni from cercariae
   to juvenile worm stages for in vitro drug testing
AB Background The arsenal in anthelminthic treatment against schistosomiasis is limited and relies almost exclusively on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). Thus, resistance to PZQ could constitute a major threat. Even though PZQ is potent in killing adult worms, its activity against earlier stages is limited. Current in vitro drug screening strategies depend on newly transformed schistosomula (NTS) for initial hit identification, thereby limiting sensitivity to new compounds predominantly active in later developmental stages. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish a highly standardized, straightforward and reliable culture method to generate and maintain advanced larval stages in vitro. We present here how this method can be a valuable tool to test drug efficacy at each intermediate larval stage, reducing the reliance on animal use (3Rs).
   Methodology/Principal findings Cercariae were mechanically transformed into skin-stage (SkS) schistosomula and successfully cultured for up to four weeks with no loss in viability in a commercially available medium. Under these serum- and cell-free conditions, development halted at the lung-stage (LuS). However, the addition of human serum (HSe) propelled further development into liver stage (LiS) worms within eight weeks. Skin and lung stages, as well as LiS, were submitted to 96-well drug screening assays using known anti-schistosomal compounds such as PZQ, oxamniquine (OXM), mefloquine (MFQ) and artemether (ART). Our findings showed stage-dependent differences in larval susceptibility to these compounds.
   Conclusion With this robust and highly standardized in vitro assay, important developmental stages of S. mansoni up to LiS worms can be generated and maintained over prolonged periods of time. The phenotype of LiS worms, when exposed to reference drugs, was comparable to most previously published works for ex vivo harvested adult worms. Therefore, this in vitro assay can help reduce reliance on animal experiments in search for new anti-schistosomal drugs.
   Author summary Schistosomiasis remains a major health threat, predominantly in developing countries. Even though there has been some progress in search of new drugs, praziquantel remains the only available drug. Probably the most important advance in the search for new drugs was in vitro transformation of cercariae and their subsequent culture. However, hit identification in compound screenings is exclusively tested in skin stage parasites and is only confirmed for more mature worms in a subsequent step. This is in part due to the lack of an easy culture system for advance-stage parasites. We present here a reliable and highly standardized way to generate LiS worms in vitro in a cell-free culture system. The inclusion of in vitro drug tests on advanced-stage parasites in initial hit identification will help to identify compounds that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, the ability to continuously observe the parasite's development in vitro will provide an important platform for a better understanding of its maturation in the human host. Taken together, this opens up new avenues to investigate the influence of specific cell types or host proteins on the development of Schistosoma mansoni and provides an additional tool to reduce animal use in future drug discovery efforts (3Rs).

TI Matching the genetics of released and local Aedes aegypti populations is
   critical to assure Wolbachia invasion
AB Background Traditional vector control approaches such as source reduction and insecticide spraying have limited effect on reducing Aedes aegypti population. The endosymbiont Wolbachia is pointed as a promising tool to mitigate arbovirus transmission and has been deployed worldwide. Models predict a rapid increase on the frequency of Wolbachia-positive Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in local settings, supported by cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and high maternal transmission rate associated with the wMelBr strain.
   Methodology/principle findings Wolbachia wMelBr strain was released for 20 consecutive weeks after receiving >87% approval of householders of the isolated community of Tubiacanga, Rio de Janeiro. wMelBr frequency plateued40% during weeks 7-19, peaked 65% but dropped as releases stopped. A high (97.56%) maternal transmission was observed. Doubling releases and deploying mosquitoes with large wing length and low laboratory mortality produced no detectable effects on invasion trend. By investigating the lab colony maintenance procedures backwardly, pyrethroid resistant genotypes in wMelBr decreased from 68% to 3.5% after 17 generations. Therefore, we initially released susceptible mosquitoes in a local population highly resistant to pyrethroids which, associated with the over use of insecticides by householders, ended jeopardizing Wolbachia invasion. A new strain (wMelRio) was produced after backcrossing wMelBr females with males from field to introduce mostly pyrethroid resistance alleles. The new strain increased mosquito survival but produced relevant negative effects on Ae. aegypti fecundity traits, reducing egg clutche size and egg hatch. Despite the cost on fitness, wMelRio successful established where wMelBr failed, revealing that matching the local population genetics, especially insecticide resistance background, is critical to achieve invasion.
   Conclusions/significance Local householders support was constantly high, reaching 90% backing on the second release (wMelRio strain). Notwithstanding the drought summer, the harsh temperature recorded (daily average above 30 degrees C) did not seem to affect the expression of maternal transmission of wMel on a Brazilian background. Wolbachia deployment should match the insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to achieve invasion. Considering pyrethroid-resistance is a widely distributed phenotype in natural Ae. aegypti populations, future Wolbachia deployments must pay special attention in maintaining insecticide resistance in lab colonies for releases.
   Author summary Traditional vector control methods have been showing limited success in managing arboviruses disease outbreaks in endemic areas. The endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia was microinjected on the mosquito Aedes aegypti and later showed the ability to block dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses' development on vector body. Nowadays, Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti has been deployed in twelve countries as an attempt to mitigate arboviruses transmission. Herein, we report the failure of Wolbachia releases on a suburban isolated district of Rio de Janeiro/Brazil. For the first time, we demonstrated that the insecticide resistance profile of released and wild mosquitoes is a critical feature for achieving Wolbachia invasion. Special consideration must be given to avoid releasing susceptible mosquitoes where native populations are resistant, since local householders might rely on domestic use of spraying insecticides (mostly pyrethroids) to protect themselves from mosquito bites.

TI Epidemiology of Strongyloides stercoralis infection in Bolivian patients
   at high risk of complications
AB Background Strongyloidiasis can be fatal in immunocompromised patients, but few epidemiological studies investigated the burden of this neglected tropical disease among these populations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries such as Bolivia. This study aimed to fill in this gap by estimating prevalence rate and risk factors associated with strongyloidiasis among patients at high risk of complications
   Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in Santa Cruz (elevation 400 meters, tropical climate) and Cochabamba (elevation 2,500 meters, temperate climate), among patients with cancer, HIV infection and rheumatic or hematologic disease, using four coproparasitological techniques and one serological (ELISA) test.
   Results In total, 1,151 patients participated in this study, including individuals who were HIV-positive (30%) or with rheumatic (29%), oncologic (32%) or hematologic (9%) diseases. The serological and coproparasitological prevalence was 23.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.7-25.5; n = 265/1151) and 7.6% (95% CI, 6.2-9.3; n = 88/1151), respectively, with an estimated actual prevalence of 20.2% (95% CI, 17.9-22.5). Positive serology and positive coproparasitology were associated with younger age and lower education levels. There was no significant difference in prevalence between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz as defined by coproparasitology (6.4% vs. 8.9%; p = 0.11) or serology (24.0% vs. 22.0%; p = 0.4). Among 64 patients in Cochabamba who had never travelled to the tropical lowlands, 5 (7.8%) had a positive coproparasitology.
   Conclusions Strongyloidiasis is widely prevalent in Bolivia among vulnerable patients at increased risk of life-threatening complications. Transmission of the parasite occurs both in tropical lowlands and temperate elevation ( 2,500 m). Control strategies to prevent transmission and complications of this serious parasitic disease should be urgently reinforced.
   Author summary Strongyloidiasis is an understudied chronic intestinal infection and one of the most overlooked of the neglected tropical diseases, particularly in countries such as Bolivia. The strongyloidiasis usually remains paucisymptomatic for decades in immunocompetent persons, but may lead to severe conditions with high mortality rates in immunocompromised individuals. We carried out a study to explore the epidemiology of strongyloidiasis among Bolivian patients with cancer, HIV infection, and rheumatic or hematologic diseases. Our study highlighted that strongyloidiasis was widely prevalent in tropical and inter-Andean temperate areas of Bolivia among patients at high risk of life-threatening complications. One in five participants was infected. We showed that strongyloidiasis was highly prevalent in both tropical and temperate regions. Improved access to adequate diagnosis, treatment, and preventive measures are therefore urgently required in Bolivia, and most likely elsewhere in the region. Treatment of uncomplicated strongyloidiasis is simple, highly effective, and potentially life-saving.

TI Topical treatment with gallium maltolate reduces Treponema pallidum
   subsp. pertenue burden in primary experimental lesions in a rabbit model
   of yaws
AB Background Gallium is a semi-metallic element known since the 1930s to have antimicrobial activity. This activity stems primarily from gallium's ability to mimic trivalent iron and disrupt specific Fe(III)-dependent pathways, particularly DNA synthesis (due to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase). Because of its novel mechanism of action, gallium is currently being investigated as a new antibacterial agent, particularly in light of the increasing resistance of many pathogenic bacteria to existing antibiotics. Gallium maltolate (GaM) is being developed as an orally and topically administrable form of gallium. Yaws is a neglected tropical disease affecting mainly the skin and skeletal system of children in underprivileged settings. It is currently the object of a WHO-promoted eradication campaign using mass administration of the macrolide azithromycin, an antibiotic to which the yaws agent Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue has slowly begun to develop genetic resistance.
   Methods Because yaws transmission is mainly due to direct skin contact with an infectious skin lesion, we evaluated the treponemicidal activity of GaM applied topically to skin lesions in a rabbit model of yaws. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by measuring lesion diameter, treponemal burden in lesion aspirates as determined by dark field microscopy and amplification of treponemal RNA, serology, and immunohistochemistry of biopsied tissue samples.
   Results Our results show that topical GaM was effective in reducing treponemal burden in yaws experimental lesions, particularly when applied at the first sign of lesion appearance but, as expected, did not prevent pathogen dissemination.
   Conclusion Early administration of GaM to yaws lesions could reduce the infectivity of the lesions and thus yaws transmission, potentially contributing to current and future yaws control campaigns.
   Author summary Yaws is a neglected tropical disease affecting children in underprivileged countries, transmitted through direct skin contact with an active lesion. This infection, although rarely fatal, can lead to disfigurement and serious disability. The World Health Organization is currently conducting a yaws eradication effort that employs mass administration of azithromycin, an antibiotic against which the yaws pathogen has slowly begun to develop genetic resistance. Because this phenomenon has the potential to undermine the eradication effort, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of gallium maltolate, which has a novel mechanism of action, against the yaws pathogen. Our initial results show that topical application of gallium maltolate has significant treponemicidal activity, and suggest that this compound might find an application in the effort to eradicate yaws. Future studies will evaluate whether oral administration of gallium maltolate is as effective as the antibiotics currently approved for yaws treatment to clear systemic infection.

TI Antagonistic effects of Plasmodium-helminth co-infections on malaria
   pathology in different population groups in Cote d'Ivoire
AB Introduction Plasmodium spp. and helminths are co-endemic in many parts of the tropics; hence, co-infection is a common phenomenon. Interactions between Plasmodium and helminth infections may alter the host's immune response and susceptibility and thus impact on morbidity. There is little information on the direction and magnitude of such interactions and results are conflicting. This study aimed at shedding new light on the potential interactions of Plasmodium and helminth co-infections on anemia and splenomegaly in different population groups in Cote d'Ivoire.
   Methodology Parasitologic and clinical data were obtained from four cross-sectional community-based studies and a national school-based survey conducted between 2011 and 2013 in Cote d'Ivoire. Six scenarios of co-infection pairs defined as Plasmodium infection or high parasitemia, combined with one of three common helminth infections (i.e., Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and hookworm) served for analysis. Adjusted logistic regression models were built for each scenario and interaction measures on additive scale calculated according to Rothman et al., while an interaction term in the model served as multiplicative scale measure.
   Principal findings All identified significant interactions were of antagonistic nature but varied in magnitude and species combination. In study participants aged 5-18 years from community-based studies, Plasmodium-hookworm co-infection showed an antagonistic interaction on additive scale on splenomegaly, while Plasmodium-Schistosoma co-infection scenarios showed protective effects on multiplicative scale for anemia and splenomegaly in participants aged 5-16 years from a school-based study.
   Conclusions/Significance No exacerbation from co-infection with Plasmodium and helminths was observed, neither in participants aged 5-18 years nor in adults from the community-based studies. Future studies should unravel underlying mechanisms of the observed interactions, as this knowledge might help shaping control efforts against these diseases of poverty.
   Author summary Malaria (due to infection with Plasmodium spp.) and parasitic worms (for example soil-transmitted helminths and Schistosoma spp.) are common in the tropics. Hence, people are often co-infected, depending on various factors. Interactions between Plasmodium and helminth infections may alter immune response and susceptibility of the infected host, and thus impact on morbidity by either making it worse (synergism) or by reducing it (antagonism). Although these co-infections are common, little is known about the direction and magnitude of such interactions. To deepen the understanding of how co-infection could affect morbidity in infected people, we looked at clinical data (i.e., anemia and splenomegaly) in different population groups in Cote d'Ivoire. We did not observe any exacerbation from co-infection with Plasmodium and helminths; all identified significant interactions were of antagonistic nature but varied in magnitude and parasite combination. In the light of enhanced control efforts targeting helminthiases, a better understanding about potential effects on susceptibility to malaria in co-endemic areas should be gained and intervention strategies against the two type of diseases be planned in a more integrative manner.

TI Genetic variation and phylogeography of the Triatoma dimidiata complex
   evidence a potential center of origin and recent divergence of
   haplogroups having differential Trypanosoma cruzi and DTU infections
AB The population genetics of Triatoma dimidiata haplogroups was analyzed at landscape and sub-regional scales in Chiapas and regional level across the Mexican Neotropics, and phylogeography of the complex was re-analyzed across its complete geographic range. Two contiguous fragments of the ND4 gene were analyzed due to bias from differential haplogroup specificity using a previously designed sequence. At both landscape (anthropic modification gradient) and regional (demographic, fragmentation, biogeographic, climate) scales, lowest T. dimidiata genetic diversity occurs where there is greatest historical anthropic modification, and where T. cruzi infection prevalence is significantly highest. Trypanosoma cruzi prevalence was significantly higher than expected in haplogroups 1 and 3, while lower than expected in haplogroup 2. There was also a significant difference of DTUI and DTUVI infection frequencies in both haplogroups 1 and 3, while no difference of either in haplogroup 2. All haplogroups from the Mexican Neotropics had moderate to high haplotype diversity, while greatest genetic differentiation was between haplogroups 1 and 3 (above F-ST = 0.868, p < 0.0001). Divergence of the complex from the MRCA was estimated between 0.97 MYA (95% HPD interval = 0.55-1.53 MYA) and 0.85 MYA (95% HPD interval = 0.42-1.5 MYA) for ND4A and both concatenated fragments, respectively, with primary divergence from the MRCA of haplogroups 2 and 3. Effective population size for Mexican haplogroups 1 and 2 increased between 0.02 and 0.03 MYA. This study supports previous ecological niche evidence for the complexs origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus, and provides evidence for recent divergence of three primary dimidiata haplogroups, with differential T. cruzi infection frequency and DTU specificity, important components of vector capacity.
   Author summary Triatoma dimidiata is one of the broadest distributed triatomine species ' complexes transmitting Trypanosoma cruzi. In Mexico, three haplogroups of the T. dimidiata complex have been reported and all are primary vectors of Chagas disease south of the Tehuantepec Isthmus. Given their epidemiological importance, the question arises whether haplogroups have similar genetic diversity in domestic/modified landscapes, as well as infection characteristics and parasite DTU associations, key components of vector capacity. The aim of the present study was to analyze Triatoma dimidiata population genetics across landscapes, sub-regional, regional, and global Neotropical realm scales, using two contiguous fragments of the ND4 gene. Our results support previous evidence for the complex ' s origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus, and provides evidence for recent divergence of three principal dimidiata haplogroups and significant secondary divergence within each. Differential T. cruzi prevalence and Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) specificity for individual haplogroups provide evidence for potential differential vector capacity within the complex in Mexico.

TI Utilization of proliferable extracellular amastigotes for transient gene
   expression, drug sensitivity assay, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene
   knockout in Trypanosoma cruzi
AB Trypanosoma cruzi has three distinct life cycle stages; epimastigote, trypomastigote, and amastigote. Amastigote is the replication stage in host mammalian cells, hence this stage of parasite has clinical significance in drug development research. Presence of extracellular amastigotes (EA) and their infection capability have been known for some decades. Here, we demonstrate that EA can be utilized as an axenic culture to aid in stage-specific study of T. cruzi. Amastigote-like property of axenic amastigote can be sustained in LIT medium at 37 degrees C at least for 1 week, judging from their morphology, amastigote-specific UTR-regulated GFP expression, and stage-specific expression of selected endogenous genes. Inhibitory effect of benznidazole and nifurtimox on axenic amastigotes was comparable to that on intracellular amastigotes. Exogenous nucleic acids can be transfected into EA via conventional electroporation, and selective marker could be utilized for enrichment of transfectants. We also demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout can be performed in EA. Essentiality of the target gene can be evaluated by the growth capability of the knockout EA, either by continuation of axenic culturing or by host infection and following replication as intracellular amastigotes. By taking advantage of the accessibility and sturdiness of EA, we can potentially expand our experimental freedom in studying amastigote stage of T. cruzi.
   Author summary We developed an experimental system to study amastigote stage of Trypanosoma cruzi as a proliferable axenic culture. Use of axenic amastigotes allows us to directly introduce exogenous gene into T. cruzi amastigote and select for drug resistant parasite to enrich the transfectants. Our strategy bypasses differentiation steps involved in conventional epimastigote transfection procedure to obtain transgenic amastigotes. Gene knockout can also be performed in amastigote-specific manner, using Cas9-expressing extracellular amastigotes. Drug sensitivity could also be assessed during 1-week axenic growth period. Our method potentially leads to variety of new experimental strategies to make amastigote-stage-specific manipulations and analyses possible.

TI Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards rabies and free-roaming
   dogs (FRD) in Shirsuphal village in western India: A community based
   cross-sectional study
AB The lack of awareness about dog-bite related rabies in the rural population of developing countries, including India, is a major impediment to controlling the incidence of disease in humans. A survey of 127 rural residents was undertaken in Shirsuphal village in western India using a structured questionnaire to assess the influence of demographic and pet/livestock owning characteristics on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the respondents towards rabies and free roaming dogs (FRD). Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed and the knowledge of the rural residents of Shirsuphal village was found to be significantly influenced by family size (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.0-4.6, p = 0.04) and poultry ownership (OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.1-4.9, p = 0.03), while their attitudes towards FRD was significantly influenced by age of the respondents (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.8) and ownership of cattle/buffalo (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-5.5). Although the knowledge score about rabies was high, a comprehensive understanding of the disease was lacking. Concerted efforts to widen the knowledge about rabies and promote healthier practices towards FRD are recommended.
   Author summary The rural population in developing countries, such as India, are most vulnerable to transmission of rabies, especially due to animal-bites. The widespread trust in traditional healing practices for treating animal-bite injuries undermines the importance of seeking post-bite vaccination against rabies. In spite of a wider acknowledgement of the role of free-roaming dogs in the transmission of rabies virus in rural human populations, the latter's attitudes towards this vector host remains influenced by the social, cultural and religious beliefs prevalent in the area. This study explores the awareness level and perception of villagers not only towards rabies but also the free-roaming dogs in the locality. Although the rural participants surveyed in this study were aware of the disease, gaps were revealed in the comprehensive knowledge about rabies and its transmission. The villagers were also found lacking in adequate practices towards free-roaming dogs that can remarkably reduce the incidence of the disease. Concerted efforts to widen the knowledge about rabies and promote healthier practices towards free-roaming dogs is recommended.

TI Development of a preliminary in vitro drug screening assay based on a
   newly established culturing system for pre-adult fifth-stage Onchocerca
   volvulus worms
AB Background The human filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus is the causative agent of onchocerciasis (river blindness). It causes blindness in 270,000 individuals with an additional 6.5 million suffering from severe skin pathologies. Current international control programs focus on the reduction of microfilaridermia by annually administering ivermectin for more than 20 years with the ultimate goal of blocking of transmission. The adult worms of O. volvulus can live within nodules for over 15 years and actively release microfilariae for the majority of their lifespan. Therefore, protracted treatment courses of ivermectin are required to block transmission and eventually eliminate the disease. To shorten the time to elimination of this disease, drugs that successfully target macrofilariae (adult parasites) are needed. Unfortunately, there is no small animal model for the infection that could be used for discovery and screening of drugs against adult O. volvulus parasites. Here, we present an in vitro culturing system that supports the growth and development of O. volvulus young adult worms from the third-stage (L3) infective stage.
   Methodology/Principal findings In this study we optimized the culturing system by testing several monolayer cell lines to support worm growth and development. We have shown that the optimized culturing system allows for the growth of the L3 worms to L5 and that the L5 mature into young adult worms. Moreover, these young O. volvulus worms were used in preliminary assays to test putative macrofilaricidal drugs and FDA-approved repurposed drugs.
   Conclusion The culture system we have established for O. volvulus young adult worms offers a promising new platform to advance drug discovery against the human filarial parasite, O. volvulus and thus supports the continuous pursuit for effective macrofilaricidal drugs. However, this in vitro culturing system will have to be further validated for reproducibility before it can be rolled out as a drug screen for decision making in macrofilaricide drug development programs.
   Author summary The human filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus is the causative agent of onchocerciasis (river blindness). To curb transmission and eventually eliminate the disease, current mass drug administration programs rely on ivermectin that primarily targets the microfilariae, which are released from adult female worms. The female worms, which can live for more than 10-15 years, release millions of microfilariae throughout the course of infection. Thus, to stop transmission of infection and shorten the time to elimination of this disease, a safe and effective drug that kills the adult stage is needed. However, there is no small animal model for an O. volvulus infection that enables investigators to validate macrofilaricidal drugs. In the present study we describe a newly developed in vitro culturing system that supports the growth and development of O. volvulus young adult worms (OvL5) from the L3 stage and show in preliminary assays that these young worms can be used as an auxiliary for screening putative macrofilaricidal drugs against the ultimate target organism, O. volvulus.

TI A Biomphalaria glabrata peptide that stimulates significant behaviour
   modifications in aquatic free-living Schistosoma mansoni miracidia
AB The human disease schistosomiasis (or bilharzia) is caused by the helminth blood fluke parasite Schistosoma mansoni, which requires an intermediate host, the freshwater gastropod snail Biomphalaria glabrata (the most common intermediate host). The free-swimming parasite miracidia utilises an excellent chemosensory sense to detect and locate an appropriate host. This study investigated the biomolecules released by the snail that stimulate changes in the behaviour of the aquatic S. mansoni miracidia. To achieve this, we have performed an integrated analysis of the snail-conditioned water, through chromatography and bioassay-guided behaviour observations, followed by mass spectrometry. A single fraction containing multiple putative peptides could stimulate extreme swimming behaviour modifications (e.g. velocity, angular variation) similar to those observed in response to crude snail mucus. One peptide (P12;R-DITSGLDPEVADD-KR) could replicate the stimulation of miracidia behaviour changes. P12 is derived from a larger precursor protein with a signal peptide and multiple dibasic cleavage sites, which is synthesised in various tissues of the snail, including the central nervous system and foot. P12 consists of an alpha helix secondary structure as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. This information will be helpful for the development of approaches to manipulate this parasites life cycle, and opens up new avenues for exploring other parasitic diseases which have an aquatic phase using methods detailed in this investigation.
   Author summary In aquatic environments, where the vast majority of animals live in darkness, key relationships are often formed and maintained by chemical communication (including smell and taste). Parasites with an aquatic life phase rely on an exquisite sense of chemosensation to detect host biomolecules (kairomones), allowing them to locate and infect their host. Our study identifies the first kairomone released by the freshwater gastropod snail Biomphalaria glabrata, an intermediate host for the helminth blood fluke parasite Schistosoma mansoni. This is a key aspect of the S. mansoni life-cycle that ultimately leads to human infection, causing the disease schistosomiasis (or bilharzia), which is considered the most devastating human helminth infection in terms of global morbidity and mortality. The kairomone we identify is a peptide that does not appear to share any similarity with any other known animal peptide. This information will be helpful as we explore methods to interrupt parasite infection, and therefore break the cycle of infection that causes a major human disease.

TI Feather mites play a role in cleaning host feathers: New insights from
   DNA metabarcoding and microscopy
AB Parasites and other symbionts are crucial components of ecosystems, regulating host populations and supporting food webs. However, most symbiont systems, especially those involving commensals and mutualists, are relatively poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the nature of the symbiotic relationship between birds and their most abundant and diverse ectosymbionts: the vane-dwelling feather mites. For this purpose, we studied the diet of feather mites using two complementary methods. First, we used light microscopy to examine the gut contents of 1,300 individual feather mites representing 100 mite genera (18 families) from 190 bird species belonging to 72 families and 19 orders. Second, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and DNA metabarcoding to determine gut contents from 1,833 individual mites of 18 species inhabiting 18 bird species. Results showed fungi and potentially bacteria as the main food resources for feather mites (apart from potential bird uropygial gland oil). Diatoms and plant matter appeared as rare food resources for feather mites. Importantly, we did not find any evidence of feather mites feeding upon bird resources (e.g., blood, skin) other than potentially uropygial gland oil. In addition, we found a high prevalence of both keratinophilic and pathogenic fungal taxa in the feather mite species examined. Altogether, our results shed light on the long-standing question of the nature of the relationship between birds and their vane-dwelling feather mites, supporting previous evidence for a commensalistic-mutualistic role of feather mites, which are revealed as likely fungivore-microbivore-detritivore symbionts of bird feathers.

TI Host-derived population genomics data provides insights into bacterial
   and diatom composition of the killer whale skin
AB Recent exploration into the interactions and relationship between hosts and their microbiota has revealed a connection between many aspects of the host's biology, health and associated micro-organisms. Whereas amplicon sequencing has traditionally been used to characterize the microbiome, the increasing number of published population genomics data sets offers an underexploited opportunity to study microbial profiles from the host shotgun sequencing data. Here, we use sequence data originally generated from killer whale Orcinus orca skin biopsies for population genomics, to characterize the skin microbiome and investigate how host social and geographical factors influence the microbial community composition. Having identified 845 microbial taxa from 2.4 million reads that did not map to the killer whale reference genome, we found that both ecotypic and geographical factors influence community composition of killer whale skin microbiomes. Furthermore, we uncovered key taxa that drive the microbiome community composition and showed that they are embedded in unique networks, one of which is tentatively linked to diatom presence and poor skin condition. Community composition differed between Antarctic killer whales with and without diatom coverage, suggesting that the previously reported episodic migrations of Antarctic killer whales to warmer waters associated with skin turnover may control the effects of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of microbiome studies from host shotgun sequencing data and highlights the importance of metagenomics in understanding the relationship between host and microbial ecology.

TI Condylomata Acuminata (Anogenital Warts) Contain Accumulations of HIV-1
   Target Cells That May Provide Portals for HIV Transmission
AB Background. Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts [AGWs]) are prevalent in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and sexually active populations at risk for HIV acquisition and have been associated with HIV transmission. We compared AGW specimens to control tissue specimens for abundance, types, and location of HIV target cells and for susceptibility to HIV infection in vitro, to provide biologic evidence that AGWs facilitate HIV transmission.
   Methods. We used immunohistologic staining to identify HIV target cells in AGW and control specimens. We also inoculated HIV in vitro into AGW and control specimens from HIV-negative men and assessed infection by means of TZM-bl and p24 assays.
   Results. CD1a(+) dendritic cells, CD4(+) T cells, and macrophages were significantly more abundant in the epidermis of AGW specimens than control specimens. These HIV target cells also often appeared in large focal accumulations in the dermis of AGW specimens. Two of 8 AGW specimens versus 0 of 8 control specimens showed robust infection with HIV in vitro.
   Conclusions. Compared with normal skin, AGWs contain significantly higher concentrations of HIV target cells that may be susceptible to HIV infection. Condylomata may thus promote HIV transmission, especially in the setting of typical lesion vascularity and friability. Prevention or treatment of AGWs may decrease the sexual transmission of HIV.

TI A protracted mumps outbreak in Western Australia despite high vaccine
   coverage: a population-based surveillance study
AB Background In 2007-08, a genotype J mumps outbreak occurred among Aboriginal people in northern Western Australia, despite high vaccine coverage. In March, 2015, a second protracted mumps outbreak occurred in northern Western Australia and spread widely across rural areas of the state. This time the outbreak was caused by a genotype G virus and again primarily affected Aboriginal people. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of this outbreak.
   Methods In this population-based surveillance study, we analysed statutory notifications and public health case follow-up data from the Western Australia Notifiable Infectious Diseases Database and vaccination information from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. An outbreak case of mumps was notified if the affected person was living in or visiting a community in Western Australia where there was active mumps transmission, and if mumps infection was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis or by an epidemiological link. We analysed case demographics, vaccination status, and age-standardised attack rates in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people by region of notification. Laboratory diagnoses were made by real-time RT-PCR, serology, or both, and carried out by the sole public pathology provider in Western Australia.
   Findings Between March 1, 2015, and December 31, 2016, 893 outbreak cases were notified. 798 (89%) of 893 outbreak cases were reported in Aboriginal people. 40 (4%) of 893 people were admitted to hospital, and 33 (7%) of 462 men reported orchitis. Mumps attack rates increased sharply with age, peaking in the 15-19 age group. 371 (89%) of 419 people aged 1-19 years were fully vaccinated and 29 (7%) were partly vaccinated. Of the 240 people who tested positive by real-time RT-PCR and had also been tested for mumps-specific IgG and IgM, 165 (69%) were positive for IgG but negative for IgM, indicating the importance of RT-PCR testing for diagnosis in vaccinated populations. None of the cases from the 2007-08 genotype J outbreak were re-notified.
   Interpretation The number of mumps outbreaks reported in recent years among highly vaccinated populations, including Indigenous populations, has been growing. More widespread and pre-emptive use of the third dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine might be required to control and prevent future outbreaks in high-risk populations. Research should explore the benefit of increasing the intervals between vaccine doses to strengthen the durability of vaccine protection.

TI Individual immune selection pressure has limited impact on seasonal
   influenza virus evolution
AB Seasonal influenza viruses are subjected to strong selection as seen by the sequential replacement of existing viral populations on the emergence of new antigenic variants. However, the process of within-host de novo mutant generation and evolutionary selection that underlies these antigenic sweeps is poorly understood. Here, we investigate mutational patterns between evolutionarily closely related human seasonal influenza viruses using host age as a proxy for immune experience. The systematic analysis of >25,000 virus sequences showed that individuals with substantially differing immune histories were frequently (30-62%) infected by viruses with identical amino acid sequences. Viruses from immunologically inexperienced individuals were as likely to possess substitutions with potential phenotypic relevance as highly experienced individuals. Mutations likely to cause antigenic changes were rare among closely related viruses and not associated with extent of host immune experience. These findings suggest that individual immune positive selection plays a limited role in the evolution of seasonal influenza viruses.

TI Within-Host Priority Effects Systematically Alter Pathogen Coexistence
AB Coinfection of host populations alters pathogen prevalence, host mortality, and pathogen evolution. Because pathogens compete for limiting resources, whether multiple pathogens can coexist in a host population can depend on their within-host interactions, which, in turn, can depend on the order in which pathogens infect hosts (within-host priority effects). However, the consequences of within-host priority effects for pathogen coexistence have not been tested. Using laboratory studies with a coinfected zooplankton system, we found that pathogens had increased fitness in coinfected hosts when they were the second pathogen to infect a host, compared to when they were the first pathogen to infect a host. With these results, we parameterized a pathogen coexistence model with priority effects, finding that pathogen coexistence (1) decreased when priority effects increased the fitness of the first pathogen to arrive in coinfected hosts and (2) increased when priority effects increased the fitness of the second pathogen to arrive in coinfected hosts. We also identified the natural conditions under which we expect within-host priority effects to foster coexistence in our system. These outcomes were the result of positive or negative frequency dependence created by feedback loops between pathogen prevalence and infection order in coinfected hosts. This suggests that priority effects can systematically alter conditions for pathogen coexistence in host populations, thereby changing pathogen community structure and potentially altering host mortality and pathogen evolution via emergent processes.

TI Mutualists Stabilize the Coexistence of Congeneric Legumes
AB Coexistence requires that stabilizing niche differences, which cause species to limit themselves more than others, outweigh relative fitness differences, which cause competitive exclusion. Interactions with shared mutualists, which can differentially affect host fitness and change in magnitude with host frequency, can satisfy these conditions for coexistence, yet empirical tests of mutualist effects on relative fitness and stabilizing niche differences are largely lacking within the framework of coexistence theory. Here, we show that N-fixing rhizobial mutualists mediate coexistence in four naturally co-occurring congeneric legume (Trifolium) species. Using experimental greenhouse communities, we quantified relative fitness and stabilizing niche differences for each species in the presence of rhizobia originating from conspecific or congeneric hosts. Rhizobia stabilized coexistence by increasing the self-limitation of Trifolium species grown with rhizobia isolated from conspecifics, thus allowing congeners to increase when rare. Greenhouse-measured invasion growth rates predicted natural, unmanipulated coexistence dynamics of Trifolium species over 2 years at our field sites. Our results demonstrate that interactions with shared mutualists can stabilize the coexistence of closely related species.

TI Evolution of transmission mode in conditional mutualisms with spatial
   variation in symbiont quality
AB Many symbioses have costs and benefits to their hosts that vary with the environmental context, which itself may vary in space. The same symbiont may be a mutualist in one location and a parasite in another. Such spatially conditional mutualisms pose a dilemma for hosts, who might evolve (higher or lower) horizontal or vertical transmission to increase their chances of being infected only where the symbiont is beneficial. To determine how transmission in hosts might evolve, we modeled transmission evolution where the symbiont had a spatially conditional effect on either host lifespan or fecundity. We found that over ecological time, symbionts that affected lifespan but not fecundity led to high frequencies of infected hosts in areas where the symbiont was beneficial and low frequencies elsewhere. In response, hosts evolved increased horizontal transmission only when the symbiont affected lifespan. We also modeled transmission evolution in symbionts, which evolved high horizontal and vertical transmission, indicating a possible host-symbiont conflict over transmission mode. Our results suggest an eco-evolutionary feedback where the component of host fitness affected by a conditionally mutualistic symbiont in turn determines its distribution in the population, and, through this, the transmission mode that evolves.

TI Loss of genetic diversity, recovery and allele surfing in a colonizing
   parasite, Geomydoecus aurei
AB Understanding the genetic consequences of changes in species distributions has wide-ranging implications for predicting future outcomes of climate change, for protecting threatened or endangered populations and for understanding the history that has led to current genetic patterns within species. Herein, we examine the genetic consequences of range expansion over a 25-year period in a parasite (Geomydoecus aurei) that is in the process of expanding its geographic range via invasion of a novel host. By sampling the genetics of 1,935 G. aurei lice taken from 64 host individuals collected over this time period using 12 microsatellite markers, we test hypotheses concerning linear spatial expansion, genetic recovery time and allele surfing. We find evidence of decreasing allelic richness (AR) with increasing distance from the source population, supporting a linear, stepping stone model of spatial expansion that emphasizes the effects of repeated bottleneck events during colonization. We provide evidence of post-bottleneck genetic recovery, with average AR of infrapopulations increasing about 30% over the 225-generation span of time observed directly in this study. Our estimates of recovery rate suggest, however, that recovery has plateaued and that this population may not reach genetic diversity levels of the source population without further immigration from the source population. Finally, we employ a grid-based sampling scheme in the region of ongoing population expansion and provide empirical evidence for the power of allele surfing to impart genetic structure on a population, even under conditions of selective neutrality and in a place that lacks strong barriers to gene flow.

TI The specificity of Burkholderia symbionts in the social amoeba farming
   symbiosis: Prevalence, species, genetic and phenotypic diversity
AB The establishment of symbioses between eukaryotic hosts and bacterial symbionts in nature is a dynamic process. The formation of such relationships depends on the life history of both partners. Bacterial symbionts of amoebae may have unique evolutionary trajectories to the symbiont lifestyle, because bacteria are typically ingested as prey. To persist after ingestion, bacteria must first survive phagocytosis. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, certain strains of Burkholderia bacteria are able to resist amoebal digestion and maintain a persistent relationship that includes carriage throughout the amoeba's social cycle that culminates in spore formation. Some Burkholderia strains allow their host to carry other bacteria, as food. This carried food is released in new environments in a trait called farming. To better understand the diversity and prevalence of Burkholderia symbionts and the traits they impart to their amoebae hosts, we first screened 700 natural isolates of D. discoideum and found 25% infected with Burkholderia. We next used a multilocus phylogenetic analysis and identified two independent transitions by Burkholderia to the symbiotic lifestyle. Finally, we tested the ability of 38 strains of Burkholderia from D. discoideum, as well as strains isolated from other sources, for traits relevant to symbiosis in D. discoideum. Only D. discoideum native isolates belonging to the Burkholderia agricolaris, B. hayleyella, and B. bonniea species were able to form persistent symbiotic associations with D. discoideum. The Burkholderia-Dictyostelium relationship provides a promising arena for further studies of the pathway to symbiosis in a unique system.

TI Ecological and Evolutionary Consequences of Viral Plasticity
AB Viruses use the host machinery to replicate, and their performance thus depends on the host's physiological state. For bacteriophages, this link between host and viral performance has been characterized empirically and with intracellular theories. Such theories are too detailed to be included in models that study host-phage interactions in the long term, which hinders our understanding of systems that range from pathogens infecting gut bacteria to marine phage shaping the oceans. Here, we combined data and models to study the short- and long-term consequences that host physiology has on bacteriophage performance. We compiled data showing the dependence of lytic-phage traits on host growth rate (referred to as viral phenotypic plasticity) to deduce simple expressions that represent such plasticity. Including these expressions in a standard host-phage model allowed us to understand mechanistically how viral plasticity affects emergent evolutionary strategies and the population dynamics associated with different environmental scenarios including, for example, nutrient pulses or host starvation. Moreover, we show that plasticity on the offspring number drives the phage ecological and evolutionary dynamics by reinforcing feedbacks between host, virus, and environment. Standard models neglect viral plasticity, which therefore handicaps their predictive ability in realistic scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of viral plasticity to unravel host-phage interactions and the need of laboratory and field experiments to characterize viral plastic responses across systems.

TI Within-host dynamics shape antibiotic resistance in commensal bacteria
AB The spread of antibiotic resistance, a major threat to human health, is poorly understood. Simple population-level models of bacterial transmission predict that above a certain rate of antibiotic consumption in a population, resistant bacteria should completely eliminate non-resistant strains, while below this threshold they should be unable to persist at all. This prediction stands at odds with empirical evidence showing that resistant and non-resistant strains coexist stably over a wide range of antibiotic consumption rates. Not knowing what drives this long-term coexistence is a barrier to developing evidence-based strategies for managing the spread of resistance. Here, we argue that competition between resistant and sensitive pathogens within individual hosts gives resistant pathogens a relative fitness benefit when they are rare, promoting coexistence between strains at the population level. To test this hypothesis, we embed mechanistically explicit within-host dynamics in a structurally neutral pathogen transmission model. Doing so allows us to reproduce patterns of resistance observed in the opportunistic pathogens Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae across European countries and to identify factors that may shape resistance evolution in bacteria by modulating the intensity and outcomes of within-host competition.

TI Optimizing syndromic health surveillance in free ranging great apes: The
   case of Gombe National Park
AB Syndromic surveillance is an incipient approach to early wildlife disease detection. Consequently, systematic assessments are needed for methodology validation in wildlife populations. We evaluated the sensitivity of a syndromic surveillance protocol for respiratory disease detection among chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Empirical health, behavioural, and demographic data were integrated with an agent-based, network model to simulate disease transmission and surveillance. Surveillance sensitivity was estimated as 66% (95% CI: 63.1, 68.8%) and 59.5% (95% CI: 56.5%, 62.4%) for two monitoring methods (weekly count and prevalence thresholds respectively), but differences among calendar quarters in outbreak size and surveillance sensitivity suggest seasonal effects. We determined that a weekly detection threshold of >= 2 chimpanzees with clinical respiratory disease leading to outbreak response protocols (enhanced observation and biological sampling) is an optimal algorithm for outbreak detection in this population. Synthesis and applications. This is the first quantitative assessment of syndromic surveillance in wildlife, providing a model approach to detecting disease emergence. Coupling syndromic surveillance with targeted diagnostic sampling in the midst of suspected outbreaks will provide a powerful system for detecting disease transmission and understanding population impacts.

TI Differential impacts of vaccination on wildlife disease spread during
   epizootic and enzootic phases
AB Dissemination of oral vaccine baits is a cost-effective method to contain and control infectious wildlife diseases. The effectiveness of vaccine barriers in slowing or halting disease spread depends on host ecology and landscape variability. However, it is not clear the extent to which the success of vaccine barriers to manage disease may change from an epizootic to an enzootic phase of a disease invasion, nor is it apparent if this depends on the quality and configuration of host habitats. We explore these questions using the raccoon variant rabies virus (RRV) as a model system. This zoonotic disease of high concern has been enzootic in eastern North America for decades, pushing into new areas and re-emerging in previously controlled zones. We use a spatially explicit individual-based model to assess how levels of oral vaccination and habitat fragmentation affect RRV spread across vaccine barriers during epizootic and enzootic phases. We use space-time characteristics of infection chains (individual-to-individual transmission of RRV) to compare simulated outcomes. Results indicate that vaccine barriers have the strongest impact on the control of RRV during the epizootic phase. Counterproductively, mid-levels of immunisation during an enzootic phase lead to more rabies-induced mortalities than lower or higher vaccination levels. Infection chains spread faster during the epizootic phase. Landscape effects on chain characteristics were more subtle than effects of invasion phase and vaccination. Synthesis and applications. A spatially explicit individual-based modelling approach to examine mechanisms of raccoon variant rabies virus spread during epizootic and enzootic phases provides insights into efficacy of wildlife disease vaccination efforts. Our results demonstrate the importance of detecting and controlling outbreaks before they become enzootic. We discuss the implications for moving vaccine barriers to push back and decrease the size of enzootic areas.

TI Prevalence of infection among asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic contact
   persons exposed to Ebola virus in Guinea: a retrospective,
   cross-sectional observational study
AB Background The prevalence of Ebola virus infection among people who have been in contact with patients with Ebola virus disease remains unclear, but is essential to understand the dynamics of transmission. This study aimed to identify risk factors for seropositivity and to estimate the prevalence of Ebola virus infection in unvaccinated contact persons.
   Methods In this retrospective, cross-sectional observational study, we recruited individuals between May 12, 2016, and Sept 8, 2017, who had been in physical contact with a patient with Ebola virus disease, from four medical centres in Guinea (Conakry, Macenta, N'zerekore, and Forecariah). Contact persons had to be 7 years or older and not diagnosed with Ebola virus disease. Participants were selected through the Postebogui survivors' cohort. We collected self-reported information on exposure and occurrence of symptoms after exposure using a questionnaire, and tested antibody response against glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and 40-kDa viral protein of Zaire Ebola virus by taking a blood sample. The prevalence of Ebola virus infection was estimated with a latent class model.
   Findings 1721 contact persons were interviewed and given blood tests, 331 of whom reported a history of vaccination so were excluded, resulting in a study population of 1390. Symptoms were reported by 216 (16%) contact persons. The median age of participants was 26 years (range 7-88) and 682 (49%) were male. Seropositivity was identified in 18 (8.33%, 95% CI 5.01-12.80) of 216 paucisymptomatic contact persons and 39 (3.32%, 5.01-12.80) of 1174 (2-4) asymptomatic individuals (p=0.0021). Seropositivity increased with participation in burial rituals (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.21-4.17; p=0.0079) and exposure to blood or vomit (aOR 2.15, 1.23-3.91; p=0.0090). Frequency of Ebola virus infection varied from 3.06% (95% CI 1.84-5.05) in asymptomatic contact persons who did not participate in burial rituals to 5.98% (2.81-8.18) in those who did, and from 7.17% (3.94-9.09) in paucisymptomatic contact persons who did not participate in burial rituals to 17.16% (12.42-22.31) among those who did.
   Interpretation This study provides a new assessment of the prevalence of Ebola virus infection among contact persons according to exposure, provides evidence for the occurrence of paucisymptomatic cases, and reinforces the importance of closely monitoring at-risk contact persons.

TI Individual and temporal variation in pathogen load predicts long-term
   impacts of an emerging infectious disease
AB Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We used individual-based modeling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed approximate Bayesian computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and demographic system properties derived from 10 yr of data after disease emergence, enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics (initial dynamics after disease emergence). Only 21% of matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 yr following devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 yr, usually with long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at equilibria. Our modeling approach is widely applicable to other host-pathogen systems to predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.
