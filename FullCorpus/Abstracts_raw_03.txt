TI Genetic evidence of local adaptation of wheat yellow rust (Puccinia
   striiformis f. sp tritici) within France
AB Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), a clonal basidiomycete causing yellow rust disease on wheat, has a long record of 'overcoming' cultivar resistance introduced by breeders. Despite the long dispersal capacity of its spores, the French population of PST presents a strong geographical structure, with the presence of a specific pathotype (array of avirulence genes) at high frequencies in the south of France. The genetic diversity underlying this differentiation was analysed by microsatellite and AFLP markers. A total of 213 French isolates belonging to 10 pathotypes collected over a 15-year period were investigated. For each of the 12 microsatellites used, polymorphism resulted from a unique allelic variant associated to the south-specific pathotype. This pathotype was characterized by 40 specific markers over the total of 63 polymorphims detected using 15 AFLP primer combinations. Phylogeographical analysis indicated a strictly clonal structure of the population, and a strong genomic divergence between the northern population and a south-specific clone. Both virulence and molecular data show that the northern French population belongs to the northwestern European population, whereas the southern clone is most likely related to a Mediterranean population, the two subpopulations resulting from the ancient divergence of two clonal lineages. While the virulence complexity in the northern population may be explained by the successive introduction of corresponding resistance genes in cultivars, the maintenance of a simple virulence type in southern France, despite gene flow between the two populations, may be explained in terms of host cultivars repartition and local adaptation to specific host or climatic conditions.

TI Rural cases of equine West Nile virus encephalomyelitis and the
   normalized difference vegetation index
AB Data from an outbreak (August to October, 2002) of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalomyelitis in a population of horses located in northern Indiana was scanned for clusters in time and space. One significant (p = 0.04) cluster of case premises was detected, occurring between September 4 and 10 in the south-west part of the study area (85.70 degrees N, 45.50 degrees W). It included 10 case premises (3.67 case premises expected) within a radius of 2264 m. Image data were acquired by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor onboard a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar-orbiting satellite. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from visible and near-infrared data of daily observations, which were composited to produce a weekly-1km(2) resolution raster image product. During the epidemic, a significant (p < 0.01) decrease (0.025 per week) in estimated NDVI was observed at all case and control premise sites. The median estimated NDVI (0.659) for case premises within the cluster identified was significantly (p < 0.01) greater than the median estimated NDVI for other case (0.571) and control (0.596) premises during the same period. The difference in median estimated NDVI for case premises within this cluster, compared to cases not included in this cluster, was greatest (5.3% and 5.1%, respectively) at 1 and 5 weeks preceding occurrence of the cluster. The NDVI may be useful for identifying foci of WNV transmission.

TI State-by-state incidences of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United
   States, 1993-2004
AB We investigated geographic disparity in numbers of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases in the United States. The 12-year incidences of HPS (cases/100,000 for total and rural residents) by state did not parallel the number of cases per state. The state with the greatest overall incidence was New Mexico, with Montana ranking second. When rural incidence based on rural human population sizes were compared, New Mexico also had the highest incidence, but Utah, Nevada, Montana, Arizona, and Colorado, in that order, also had high incidences. From these evaluations, it is clear that, in order to allow a precise risk assessment of acquiring HPS, we must first understand the host-virus cycle and we must have data regarding more exact conditions of human behaviors and exposure to the etiologic agent.

TI Peak shift and epidemiology in a seasonal host-nematode system
AB Insight into the dynamics of parasite-host relationships of higher vertebrates requires an understanding of two important features: the nature of transmission and the development of acquired immunity in the host. A dominant hypothesis proposes that acquired immunity develops with the cumulative exposure to infection, and consequently predicts a negative relationship between peak intensity of infection and host age at this peak. Although previous studies have found evidence to support this hypothesis through between-population comparisons, these results are confounded by spatial effects. In this study, we examined the dynamics of infection of the nematode Trichostrongylus retortaeformis within a natural population of rabbits sampled monthly for 26 years. The rabbit age structure was reconstructed using body mass as a proxy for age, and the host age-parasite intensity relationship was examined for each rabbit cohort born from February to August. The age-intensity curves exhibited a typical concave shape, and a significant negative relationship was found between peak intensity of infection and host age at this peak. Adult females showed a distinct periparturient rise in T retortaeformis infection, with higher intensities in breeding adult females than adult males and non-breeding females. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of an acquired immune response of the host to a parasite infection, supporting the principle that acquired immunity can be modelled using the cumulative exposure to infection. These findings also show that seasonality can be an important driver of host-parasite interactions.

TI Influence of spatial heterogeneity on an emerging infectious disease:
   the case of dengue epidemics
AB The importance of spatial heterogeneity and spatial scales (at a village or neighbourhood scale) has been explored with individual-based models. Our reasoning is based on the Chilean Easter Island (EI) case, where a first dengue epidemic occurred in 2002 among the relatively small population localized in one village. Even in this simple situation, the real epidemic is not consistent with homogeneous models. Conversely, including contact heterogeneity on different scales (intra-households, inter-house, inter-areas) allows the recovery of not only the El epidemiological curve but also the qualitative patterns of Brazilian urban dengue epidemic in more complex situations.

TI Episymbiotic microbes as food and defence for marine isopods: unique
   symbioses in a hostile environment
AB Symbioses profoundly affect the diversity of life, often through novel biochemical services that symbionts provide to their hosts. These biochemical services are typically nutritional enhancements and less commonly defensive, but rarely both simultaneously. On the coral reefs of Papua New Guinea, we discovered unique associations between marine isopod crustaceans (Santia spp.) and episymbiotic microbes. Transmission electron microscopy and pigment analyses show that episymbiont biomass is dominated by large (20-30 mu m) cyanobacterial cells. The isopods consume these photosymbionts and 'cultivate' them by inhabiting exposed sunlit substrates, a behaviour made possible by symbionts' production of a chemical defence that is repulsive to fishes. Molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the symbiotic microbial communities are diverse and probably dominated in terms of population size by bacteria and small unicellular Synechococcus-type cyanobacteria. Although largely unknown in the oceans, defensive symbioses probably promote marine biodiversity by allowing niche expansions into otherwise hostile environments.

TI Age-specific seroprevalence, of hepatitis A among school children in
   central Tunisia
AB Hepatitis A virus (HAV) has different epidemiologic and clinical patterns, depending on the level of endemicity in a given geographic area. Tunisia is considered a region of high endemicity for hepatitis. Improvement of socioeconomic conditions in this country has made a determination of the seroprevalence of this disease advisable. We assessed the seroprevalence of HAV in Sousse in central Tunisia. A total of 2,400 school children 5-20 years of age (mean +/- SD age = 11.7 +/- 3.5 years) were selected by two-stage cluster sampling and tested serologically for IgG antibody to HAV by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The overall seroprevalence among this population was 60% (44%, in children < 1.0 years old, 58% in those 10-15 years of age, and 83% in those > 15 years of age. Seroprevalence also varied according to area of residence. At the age of 10, 21.3% of school children living in the urban areas and 87.7% of those living in rural areas had antibodies to HAV. Other factors that increased seroprevalence included non-potable water, crowding, and a low education level of parents with odds ratios of 4.37, 2.96, and 2.62, respectively. This study has shown an increase of seroprevalence with age, suggesting that transmission among younger children has decreased, particularly in urban areas. Programs to prevent hepatitis A may need to be modified based upon the changing age distribution of the disease and mass vaccination program could be indicated if additional incidence and prevalence data confirm the intermediate endemicity of HAV.

TI Effects of combined diethylcarbamazine and albendazole treatment of
   bancroftian filariasis on parasite uptake and development in Culex
   pipiens L.
AB We studied effects of combined diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole (ALB) treatment on Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaria (MF) uptake and development of infective larvae (L3) in Culex pipiens. Consenting Egyptian adults with microfilaremia (MF > 300/mL) were treated with one or seven daily doses of DEC/ALB. Laboratory-reared mosquitoes were fed on subjects before and after treatment. MF uptake and infectivity (assessed by mosquito dissection) were reduced by 89.6% and 82.9%, respectively, 12 months after single-dose treatment and by 96.2% and 99.7%, respectively, after multi-dose treatment. The L3:mosquito ratio decreased by 88% to 0.082 after single-dose treatment and by 99.8% to 0.001 after multi-dose treatment. If high coverage rates can be achieved for several annual cycles, mass drug administration (MDA) with DEC/ALB has the potential to decrease transmission to unsustainable levels and eliminate filariasis in populations. Multi-dose MDA (especially in the first year) might interrupt transmission with fewer cycles than single-dose treatment.

TI Species coexistence and pathogens with frequency-dependent transmission
AB Pathogens that infect multiple hosts are commonly transmitted by vectors, and their transmission rate is often thought to depend on the proportion of hosts or vectors infected (i.e., frequency dependence). A model of a two-host, one-pathogen system with frequency-dependent transmission is used to investigate how sharing a pathogen with an alternative host influences pathogen-mediated extinction. The results show that if there is frequency-dependent transmission, a host can be rescued from pathogen-mediated extinction by the presence of a second host with which it shares a pathogen. The study provides an important conceptual counter-example to the idea that shared pathogens necessarily result in apparent competition by showing that shared pathogens can mediate apparent mutualism. We distinguish two types of dilution effect (pathogen reduction with increasing host diversity), each resulting from different underlying pathogen transmission processes and host density effects. These results have important consequences for understanding the role of pathogens in species interactions and in maintaining host species diversity.

TI Wildlife trade and global disease emergence
AB The global trade in wildlife provides disease transmission mechanisms that not only cause human disease outbreaks but also threaten livestock, international trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife populations, and the health of ecosystems. Outbreaks resulting from wildlife trade have caused hundreds of billions of dollars of economic damage globally. Rather than attempting to eradicate pathogens or the wild species that may harbor them, a practical approach would include decreasing the contact rate among species, including humans, at the interface created by the wildlife trade. Since wildlife marketing functions as a system of scale-free networks with major hubs, these points provide control opportunities to maximize the effects of regulatory efforts.

TI Primate-to-human retroviral transmission in Asia
AB We describe the first reported transmission to a human of simian foamy virus (SFV) from a free-ranging population of nonhuman primates in Asia. The transmission of an exogenous retrovirus, SFV, from macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to a human at a monkey temple in Bali, Indonesia, was investigated with molecular and serologic techniques. Antibodies to SFV were detected by Western blotting of serum from 1 of 82 humans tested. SFV DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the blood of the same person. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products confirmed the virus's close phylogenetic relationship to SFV isolated from macaques at the same temple. This study raises concerns that persons who work at or live around monkey temples are at risk for infection with SFV.

TI Virulence evolution in emerging infectious diseases
AB Models of virulence evolution generally consider the outcome of competition between resident and mutant parasite strains at or near endemic equilibrium. Less studied is what happens during the initial phases of invasion and adaptation. Understanding initial adaptive dynamics is particularly important in the context of emerging diseases in wildlife and humans, for which rapid and accurate intervention may be of the essence. To address the question of virulence evolution in emerging diseases, we employ a simple stochastic modeling framework. As is intuitive, the pathogen strains most likely to emerge are those with the highest net reproductive rates (R-0). We find, however, that stochastic events shape the properties of emerging pathogens in sometimes unexpected ways. First, the mean virulence of emerging pathogens is expected to be larger in dense host populations and/or when transmission is high, due to less restrictive conditions for the spread of the pathogen. Second, a positive correlation between average virulence and transmissibility emerges due to a combination of drift and selection. We conclude that at least in the initial phases of adaptation, special assumptions about constraints need not be invoked to explain some virulence-transmission correlations and that virulence management practices should consider how residual variation in transmission and virulence can be selected to reduce the prevalence and/or virulence of emerging infectious diseases.

TI Evolutionary dynamics of a spatially structured host-parasite
   association: Drosophila innubila and male-killing Wolbachia
AB The mode and tempo of host-parasite evolution depend on population structure and history and the strength of selection that the species exert on each other. Here we genetically and epidemiologically characterize populations of the mycophagous fly Drosophila innubila and its male-killing Wolbachia endosymbiont, with the aim of integrating the local through global nature of this association. Drosophila innubila inhabit the forested "sky island" regions of the of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where its distribution is highly fragmented. We examine geographically isolated sky island populations of D. innubila, surveying the frequency and expression of Wolbachia infection as well as the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations of the host and parasite. In all populations, Wolbachia infection is associated with virtually complete male-killing, thus providing no evidence for the evolution of population-specific interaction phenotypes or local resistance. Although Wolbachia infection occurs in each of the main populations, there is variation among populations in the prevalence of infection and the resulting population-level sex ratio of D. innubila. Among these populations, the nuclear genes of D. innubila show moderate, though significant, differentiation. In contrast, the host mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which shares transmission with Wolbachia, exhibits substantially greater geographic differentiation, even after accounting for differences in transmission between nuclear and mitochondrial genes. We suggest that this pattern is caused by local Wolbachia-but not D. innubila-fluctuations in prevalence that increase the severity of drift experienced only by the mtDNA. Overall, our data suggest that the association between D. innubila and male-killing Wolbachia is ecologically dynamic within local populations, but evolutionarily coherent across the species as a whole.

TI Space-time clustering of cowpox virus infection in wild rodent
   populations
AB 1. The spatial and temporal scale at which infectious animals pose a transmission risk to others may be inferred by a study of space-time interaction in the clustering of cases of infection.
   2. We analyse the distribution of bank voles and wood mice infectious with cowpox virus, using 7 years of monthly live-trapping data from a woodland in north-west England.
   3. A published method, K-function analysis, is adapted to measure space-time interaction among infectious animals trapped on a grid system, where the populations at risk may vary in density.
   4. We hypothesized that the risk of cowpox transmission from an infectious animal would be contained within a temporal scale of one infectious period and a spatial scale of one home-range diameter.
   5. Cowpox cases among wood mice showed significantly greater spatial clustering than the population at risk at the smallest spatial scale, corresponding to animals caught in the same location. At larger scales, and for bank voles at all scales, cowpox cases showed no spatial clustering beyond that expected from an association with host distribution.
   6. Cowpox cases among wood mice showed strong evidence of temporal clustering beyond that of the host population, indicating short-lived outbreaks. No such effect was apparent among bank voles.
   7. Significant space-time interaction among cowpox cases was detected at the hypothesized spatial and temporal scales in both host species. This suggests that the risk of transmission is concentrated locally.
   8. Results are discussed in terms of transmission, including consideration of the appropriateness of distance and nearest-neighbour based clustering tests to infections transmitted by local density and frequency dependent mechanisms.

TI Spatial scale of local adaptation in a plant-pathogen metapopulation
AB The rate and scale of gene flow can strongly affect patterns of local adaptation in host-parasite interactions. I used data on regional pathogen occurrence to infer the scale of pathogen dispersal and to identify pathogen metapopulations in the interaction between Plantago lanceolata and its specialist phytopathogen, Podosphaera plantaginis. Frequent extinctions and colonizations were recorded in the metapopulations, suggesting substantial gene flow at this spatial scale. The level of pathogen local adaptation was assessed in a laboratory inoculation experiment at three different scales: in sympatric host populations, in sympatric host metapopulations and in allopatric host metapopulations. I found evidence for adaptation to sympatric host populations, as well as evidence indicating that local adaptation may extend to the scale of the sympatric host metapopulation. There was also variation among the metapopulations in the degree of pathogen local adaptation. This may be explained by regional differences in the rate of migration.

TI Can cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing Wolbachia promote the evolution
   of mate preferences?
AB The maternally inherited bacterium, Wolbachia pipientis, manipulates host reproduction by rendering uninfected females reproductively incompatible with infected males (cytoplasmic incompatibility, CI). Hosts may evolve mechanisms, such as mate preferences, to avoid fitness costs of Wolbachia infection. Despite the potential importance of mate choice for Wolbachia population dynamics, this possibility remains largely unexplored. Here we model the spread of an allele encoding female mate preference for uninfected males alongside the spread of CI inducing Wolbachia. Mate preferences can evolve but the spread of the preference allele depends on factors associated with both Wolbachia infection and the preference allele itself. Incomplete maternal transmission of Wolbachia, fitness costs and low CI, improve the spread of the preference allele and impact on the population dynamics of Wolbachia. In addition, mate preferences are found in infected individuals. These results have important consequences for the fate of Wolbachia and studies addressing mate preferences in infected populations.

TI How a complex life cycle can improve a parasite's sex life
AB How complex life cycles of parasites are maintained is still a fascinating and unresolved topic. Complex life cycles using three host species, free-living stages, asexual and sexual reproduction are widespread in parasitic helminths. For such life cycles, we propose here that maintaining a second intermediate host in the life cycle can be advantageous for the individual parasite to increase the intermixture of different clones and therefore decrease the risk of matings between genetically identical individuals in the definitive host. Using microsatellite markers, we show that clone mixing occurs from the first to the second intermediate host in natural populations of the eye-fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. Most individuals released by the first intermediate host belonged to one clone. In contrast, the second intermediate host was infected with a diverse array of mostly unique parasite genotypes. The proposed advantage of increased parasite clone intermixture may be a novel selection pressure favouring the maintenance of complex life cycles.

   variants with the K103N Nevirapine (NVP) resistance mutation in some
   women and infants after the administration of single-dose NVP: HIVNET
   012
AB Background. The HIV Network for Prevention Trials (HIVNET) 012 trial showed that NVP resistance (NVPR) emerged in some women and children after the administration of single-dose nevirapine (SD-NVP). We tested whether K103N-containing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 variants persisted in women and infants 1 year or more after the administration of SD-NVP.
   Methods. We analyzed samples from 9 women and 5 infants in HIVNET 012 who had NVPR 6-8 weeks after the administration of SD-NVP. Samples were analyzed with the ViroSeq system and with 2 sensitive resistance assays, LigAmp and TyHRT.
   Results. ViroSeq detected the K103N mutation in 8 of 9 women and in 2 of 5 infants. LigAmp detected the K103N mutation at low levels in 8 of 9 women and in 4 of 5 infants. K103N was not detected by ViroSeq 12 24 months after the administration of SD-NVP but was detected by LigAmp in 3 of 9 women and in 1 of 5 infants. K103N was also detected in those samples by use of the TyHRT assay.
   Conclusions. K103N-containing variants persist in some women and infants for 1 year or more after the administration of SD-NVP. Sensitive resistance assays may provide new insight into the impact of antiretroviral drug exposure on HIV-1 evolution.

AB Objective. In the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Network for Prevention Trials (HIVNET) 012 trial in Uganda, 6-8 weeks after single-dose nevirapine (SD-NVP), NVP resistance mutations were detected at a higher rate in women with HIV-1 subtype D than in women with subtype A. Here, we evaluate the rate of NVP resistance mutations in women with subtype C.
   Methods. NVP resistance mutations were detected using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System.
   Results. The portion of women with any NVP resistance mutation was higher in those with subtype C (45/65 [69.2%] in the NVP and zidovudine trial, Malawi) than in those in the HIVNET 012 trial with either subtype A (28/144 [19.4%]; P < .0001) or subtype D (35/97 [36.1%]; P < .0001). In a multivariate model, subtype (C vs. A: odds ratio [OR], 8.73 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.29-17.76]; C vs. D: OR, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.65-6.93]) and viral load at delivery (OR, 2.35 [ 95% CI, 1.62-3.40]) independently predicted NVP resistance mutations, but maternal age, parity, and time between SD-NVP and the 6-8-week visit did not.
   Conclusions. The rate of NVP resistance mutations after SD-NVP was significantly higher in women with HIV-1 subtype C than in women with subtype A or D. Studies are needed to assess the clinical significance of this finding.

TI Differential organization of the local immune response in patients with
   active cavitary tuberculosis or with nonprogressive tuberculoma
AB Background. In 90% of all cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection results in latency rather than active disease, with the pathogen being contained within granulomatous lesions at the site of primary infection. Failure of this containment leads to reactivation of postprimary tuberculosis ( TB). The regional immune processes that sustain the delicate balance with persistent M. tuberculosis, however, remain unclear.
   Methods. We compared activation statuses, biological functions, and interactions of host immune cells in human nonprogressive tuberculoma and active cavitary tuberculous lung tissue.
   Results. Dissection of early granuloma formations revealed differential cellular distribution and activation statuses of distinct cell types in different regions relative to the central caseotic caverna or the tuberculoma in tuberculous lung tissue. In patients with tuberculoma with latent infection, distant parts of lung tissue exhibited strong vascularization and profound proliferative activity, indicating that continuous immune defense is required for mycobacterial containment, which is absent in cavitary tuberculous lung lesions.
   Conclusions. We conclude that differential regulation of the local immune response is crucial for the containment of M. tuberculosis and that a continuous antigen-specific cross talk between the host immune system and M. tuberculosis is ensured during latency. This activation requires sufficient supply of nutrients and well-coordinated structural organization, both of which are lost during reactivation of TB.

TI The effect of a bacteriophage on diversification of the opportunistic
   bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that colonizes the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CF lungs often contain a diverse range of P aeruginosa phenotypes, some of which are likely to contribute to the persistence of infection, yet the causes of diversity are unclear. While the ecological heterogeneity of the lung environment and therapeutic regimes are probable factors, a role for parasitic bacteriophage cannot be ruled out. Parasites have been implicated as a key ecological variable driving the evolution of diversity in host populations. PP7 drove cycles of morphological diversification in host populations of P aeruginosa due to the de novo evolution of small-rough colony variants that coexisted with large diffuse colony morph bacteria. In the absence of phage, bacteria only displayed the large diffuse colony morphology of the wild-type. Further assays revealed there to be two distinct types of resistant bacteria; these had very different ecological phenotypes, yet each carried a cost of resistance.

TI Genetic variations in the receptor-ligand pair CCR5 and CCL3L1 are
   important determinants of susceptibility to Kawasaki disease
AB Kawasaki disease (KD) is an enigmatic, self-limited vasculitis of childhood that is complicated by development of coronary-artery aneurysms. The high incidence of KD in Asian versus European populations prompted a search for genetic polymorphisms that are differentially distributed among these populations and that influence KD susceptibility. Here, we demonstrate a striking, inverse relationship between the worldwide distribution of CCR5-Delta 32 allele and the incidence of KD. In 164 KD patient-parent trios, 4 CCR5 haplotypes including the CCR5-Delta 32 allele were differentially transmitted from heterozygous parents to affected children. However, the magnitude of the reduced risk of KD associated with the CCR5-Delta 32 allele and certain CCR5 haplotypes was significantly greater in individuals who also possessed a high copy number of the gene encoding CCL3L1, the most potent CCR5 ligand. These findings, derived from the largest genetic study of any systemic vasculitis, suggest a central role of CCR5-CCL3L1 gene-gene interactions in KD susceptibility and the importance of gene modifiers in infectious diseases.

TI Associations between malaria and MHC genes in a migratory songbird
AB Malaria parasites are a widespread and species-rich group infecting many wild populations of mammals, birds and reptiles. Studies on humans have demonstrated that genetic factors play a key role in the susceptibility and outcome of malaria infections. Until the present study, it has not been examined whether genetic variation in hosts is important for the outcome of malaria infections in natural avian populations. We investigated associations between major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and prevalence of three different avian malaria parasites (Haemoproteus payevshyi (GRW1), Plasmodium sp. (GRW2) and Plasmodium sp. (GRW4)) in a long-term study of great reed warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus. We hypothesized that the MHC genes could either give full protection against a malaria infection, or confer protection against lethal malaria and direct the infection towards being milder. We found a positive association between numbers of MHC class I alleles (a measure of level of heterozygosity) and prevalence of the GRW2 parasite, suggesting the latter scenario. There was also a positive association between a specific MHC allele (B4b), previously shown to be under frequency-dependent selection in the study population, and prevalence of GRW2. These associations suggest that individuals carrying either a large number of MHC alleles or a specific MHC allele are protected against lethal malaria infections.

AB The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis has been implemented to reduce human microfilaremia to levels low enough to break the transmission of the disease by using single annual doses of albendazole in combination with diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin. Many veterinary helminth parasites have developed resistance against both albendazole and ivermectin. Resistance to albendazole in veterinary nematodes is known to be caused by either of two single amino acid substitutions from phenylalanine to tyrosine in parasite beta-tubulin at position 167 or 200. We have developed assays capable of detecting these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Wuchereria bancrofti, and have applied them to microfilaria obtained from patients in Ghana and Burkina Faso. One of the SNPs was found in worms from untreated populations in both locations. Worms from treated patients had significantly higher frequencies of these mutations. These findings indicate that a beta-tubulin allele associated with benzimidazole resistance is being selected in these populations.

In Brazil, the current control program for Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus populations includes larval density surveys. An interesting alternative is the use of a distinct index, the Premise Condition Index (PCI). This tool relates conditions of property, such as houses and yards, and the degree of shade with the occurrence of Aedes sp. oviposition, and is calculated as scores from 3 to 9. The lowest score indicates property in good condition and an unfavorable breeding environment, while the highest score indicates property at high risk for infestation by Aedes sp.

TI Potential role of sylvatic and domestic African mosquito species in
   dengue emergence
AB Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) strains that circulate in sylvatic habitats of Senegal and other parts of west Africa are believed to represent ancestral forms that evolved into endemic/epidemic strains that now circulate widely in urban areas of the tropics. Previous studies suggested that the evolution of the endemic/epidemic strains was mediated by adaptation to the peridomestic mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. We conducted experimental infections using sylvatic and peridomestic Senegalese mosquitoes, and both sylvatic and urban DENV-2 strains to determine if endemic DENV-2 adaptation was vector species specific, and to assess ancestral vector susceptibility. Aedes furcifer and Ae. luteocephalus, probable sylvatic vectors, were highly susceptible to both sylvatic and urban DENV-2 strains. In contrast, sylvatic Ae. vittatus and both sylvatic and peridomestic populations of Ae. aegypti were relative refractory to all DENV-2 strains tested. These results indicate that adaptation of DENV-2 to urban vectors did not result in a loss of infectivity for some African sylvatic vectors. Implications for dengue emergence in west Africa are discussed.

Sera from 181 inmates were analysed for HAV antibody, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibody, HDV antibody, HIV antibody and HCV genotypes. Prevalence of HAV antibody, HBcAb, HBsAg, HCV antibody, HDV antibody and HIV antibody were 99.4, 4.4, 0.0, 10.0, 0.0 and 0.6% respectively. HCV genotype I a predominated in HCV-infected inmates (62.5 %), followed by HCV genotype 1b (25 %) and HCV genotype 3 (12.5 %). An association between HBV infection and age > 30 years was found. HCV infection was associated with being born in Durango City, history of hepatitis, ear piercing, tattooing, drug abuse history, intravenous drug use and lack of condom use. We concluded that the prevalence of HAV, HBV, HDV and HIV infections in inmates in Durango, Mexico were comparable to those of the Mexican general population and blood donors, but lower than those reported in other prisons around the world. However, HCV infection in inmates was higher than that reported in Mexican blood donors but lower than those reported in other prisons of the world. These results have implications for the optimal planning of preventive and therapeutic measures.

TI Transmission of two Australian strains of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)
   in enclosure populations of house mice (Mus domesticus)
AB To control plagues of free-living mice (Mus domesticus) in Australia, a recombinant murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) expressing fertility proteins is being developed as an immunocontraceptive agent. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to monitor the transmission of two genetically variable field strains of MCMV through mouse populations after 25 % of founding mice were infected with the N1 strain, followed by the G4 strain 6 weeks later. Pathogen-free wild-derived mice were released into outdoor enclosures located in northwestern Victoria (Australia). Of those mice not originally inoculated with virus, NI DNA was detected in more than 80 % of founder mice and a third of their offspring and similarly, G4 DNA was detected in 13 % of founder mice and in 3 % of their offspring. Thus, prior immunity to NI did not prevent transmission of G4. This result is promising for successful transmission of an immunocontraceptive vaccine through Australian mouse populations where MCMV infection is endemic.

TI The effect of Wolbachia versus genetic incompatibilities on
   reinforcement and speciation
AB Wolbachia is a widespread group of intracellular bacteria commonly found in arthropods. In many insect species, Wolbachia induce a cytoplasmic mating incompatibility (CI). If different Wolbachia infections occur in the same host species, bidirectional Cl is often induced. Bidirectional Cl acts as a postzygotic isolation mechanism if parapatric host populations are infected with different Wolbachia strains. Therefore, it has been suggested that Wolbachia could promote speciation in their hosts. In this article we investigate theoretically whether Wolbachia-induced bidirectional Cl selects for premating isolation and therefore reinforces genetic divergence between parapatric host populations. To achieve this we combined models for Wolbachia dynamics with a well-studied reinforcement model. This new model allows us to compare the effect of bidirectional Cl on the evolution of female mating preferences with a situation in which postzygotic isolation is caused by nuclear genetic incompatibilities (NI). We distinguish between nuclear incompatibilities caused by two loci with epistatic interactions, and a single locus with incompatibility among heterozygotes in the diploid phase. Our main findings are: (1) bidirectional Cl and single locus NI select for premating isolation with a higher speed and for a wider parameter range than epistatic NI; (2) under certain parameter values, runaway sexual selection leads to the increase of an introduced female preference allele and fixation of its preferred male trait allele in both populations, whereas under others it leads to divergence in the two populations in preference and trait alleles; and (3) bidirectional Cl and single locus NI can stably persist up to migration rates that are two times higher than seen for epistatic NI. The latter finding is important because the speed with which mutants at the preference locus spread increases exponentially with the migration rate. In summary, our results show that bidirectional Cl selects for rapid premating isolation and so generally support the view that Wolbachia can promote speciation in their hosts.

TI Is a starving host tastier? Reproduction in fleas parasitizing
   food-limited rodents
AB 1. We hypothesized that food availability, and therefore body condition, of a rodent host, Meriones crassus, affects egg production and survival, and development time of preimago and adults of the first generation of the flea Xenopsylla ramesis.
   2. Egg production was significantly higher in fleas parasitizing underfed than control animals.
   3. Food availability for hosts affected survival of eggs and larvae produced by fleas on these rodents, but did not affect survival of pupae. More than twice the number of eggs from fleas on food-limited hosts survived than those from fleas on control rodents. Highest larval survival was recorded in fleas on rodents with 30% of maintenance energy intake.
   4. Survival of new generation imagos was lowest in fleas from parents on hosts with the highest food limitation. By contrast, survival of parent fleas was highest on hosts offered 30% of maintenance energy intake.
   5. Time of egg and larval development was longest on hosts consuming 30% of energy requirements for maintenance. By contrast, there was no difference in time to emergence in pupae from flea females on rodents from different treatments. Survival time under starvation of imago of the first generation was shortest in offspring of fleas that parasitized M. crassus offered the minimal amount of food. The opposite was true for parent fleas.
   6. The results suggest nutritional and/or energetic cost of host resistance, measured as host-mediated parasite fitness loss, as well as possible adaptive stress-induced immunosuppression.

TI Does infectious disease influence the efficacy of marine protected
   areas? A theoretical framework
AB 1. Marine protected areas are increasingly being recommended as an essential component of the management of exploited marine species, but virtually no attention has been given to the influence of parasites. This may be substantial, as a primary effect of marine reserves is to increase the density of an exploited population within the reserve relative to outside the reserve, which may facilitate parasite transmission.
   2. We used a simple deterministic model of microparasitic infection in a fishery with a reserve to investigate equilibrium yield and parasite prevalence inside and outside the reserve as a function of three control variables: the proportion of habitat inside the reserve, fishing mortality and the rate of interchange between the stock and the reserve.
   3. While our model is generic, we parameterized it with values that may be appropriate to the interaction between abalone and Rickettsia.
   4. The presence of a pathogen does not necessarily decrease yield when a reserve is present, particularly if the rate of movement of adult hosts between stock and reserve is low.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Pathogens have important implications for the design of marine reserves. Our modelling identifies two key considerations. First, 'fishing out' a pathogen by reducing the host population density to a level below the threshold for disease maintenance is a potential management strategy that is made more difficult by establishing a reserve. Secondly, the effect of a highly transmissible pathogen without a reserve is to cause a rapid decline in equilibrium yield for efforts beyond those that produce maximum sustainable yield, making the fishery prone to collapse. Introducing a reserve decreases yield in this case, but makes the fishery much more resistant to collapse.

TI Effects of logging on gastrointestinal parasite infections and infection
   risk in African primates
AB 1. The impact of habitat disturbance on biodiversity conservation and animal health is poorly understood. Selective logging results in a suite of alterations that may increase infection risk and susceptibility to infection in resident populations.
   2. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of this interplay by examining the effects of logging on infection risk and gastrointestinal parasite infections in three primate species whose populations have responded differently to selective logging in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Populations of redtail guenons Cercopithecus ascanius are declining in logged forest; red colobus Piliocolobus tephrosceles populations are in a state of slow recovery; and black-and-white colobus Colobus guereza populations are increasing in logged forest.
   3. We collected faecal samples from these three primate species over a period of 5 years in logged and undisturbed forest, to compare parasite infection prevalence and the magnitude of multiple infections. We also analysed canopy and ground vegetation plots to compare environmental contamination with primate parasites in logged and undisturbed forest.
   4. The prevalence and richness of gastrointestinal helminth and protozoan parasite infections, and the magnitude of multiple infections were greater for redtail guenons in logged than undisturbed forest, but these parameters did not differ between forest types for either colobine. Data from the canopy and ground vegetation plots revealed that infective stages of two representative generalist primate parasites occurred at higher densities in logged compared with undisturbed forest, signifying a greater infection risk for all primate species in logged forest.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that selective logging can be associated with changes in an important ecological association between hosts and parasites. Our results indicate that anthropogenic habitat change could influence patterns of parasite infection in primates with associated effects on population performance.

TI Assessing the host disease status of wildlife and the implications for
   disease control: Mycobacterium bovis infection in feral ferrets
AB 1. Estimating the basic reproductive rate (R-0) of disease and/or the related threshold population density (K-T) for disease establishment is fundamental to determining the host status of wildlife for disease, and thus the effective management of pathogens in free-ranging wildlife. The strength of inference of host status is largely dependent on the precision with which either R-0 or K-T is estimated, yet only a small proportion of studies of disease in wildlife have estimated the precision of these parameters.
   2. We used a combination of observations, field experiments and modelling to estimate the basic reproductive rate of Mycobacterium bovis infection in ferrets Mustela furo in New Zealand. Estimates of R-0 ranged from 0.18 at the lowest standardized annual density (0.5 ferrets km(-2)) recorded, to 1.2 at the highest standardized annual density (3.4 ferrets km(-2)) recorded. The estimates of R-0 were moderately imprecise, with a coefficient of variation of 37%.
   3. The estimated threshold standardized annual density (K-T) for disease establishment was 2.9 ferrets km(-2) (95% confidence interval 1.7-10.6 ferrets km(-2)); however, only in limited geographical areas of New Zealand do ferret population densities exceed this. In these areas, ferrets would be considered maintenance hosts (R-0 > 1) for the disease, and active management (e.g. density reduction or vaccination) of ferrets would be required to eradicate M. bovis from ferret populations, in addition to the elimination of sources of interspecific transmission, notably brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The results have considerable implications for the management of M. bovis in ferret populations in New Zealand and elsewhere in the world. In areas of high ferret density, ferrets are probably a maintenance host of bovine tuberculosis, so active management is required to reduce disease incidence. More widely, the results demonstrate clearly how modelling and field observations may be combined to better inform managers of a wildlife disease.

TI The importance of recent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in an
   area with high HIV prevalence: A long-term molecular epidemiological
   study in northern Malawi
AB Background. The proportion of cases of tuberculosis due to recent infection can be estimated in long-term population-based studies using molecular techniques. Here, we present what is, to our knowledge, the first such study in an area with high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence.
   Methods. All patients with tuberculosis in Karonga District, Malawi, were interviewed. Isolates were genotyped using restriction-fragment-length polymorphism ( RFLP) patterns. Strains were considered to be "clustered" if at least 1 other patient had an isolate with an identical pattern.
   Results. RFLP results were available from 83% of culture-positive patients from late 1995 to early 2003. When strains with ! 5 bands were excluded, 72% ( 682/948) were clustered. Maximum clustering was reached using a 4-year window, with an estimated two-thirds of cases due to recent transmission. The proportion clustered decreased with age and varied by area of residence. In older adults, clustering was less common in men and more common in patients who were HIV positive ( adjusted odds ratio, 5.1 [95% confidence interval, 2.1-12.6]).
   Conclusions. The proportion clustered found in the present study was among the highest in the world, suggesting high rates of recent transmission. The association with HIV infection in older adults may suggest that HIV has a greater impact on disease caused by recent transmission than on that caused by reactivation.

TI F-statistics of clonal diploids structured in numerous demes
AB The expected apportionment of genetic diversity in diploid clonal organisms structured in numerous subpopulations is explored. Under the specific assumptions considered, corresponding, for instance, to clonal pathogens infecting a large number of hosts, the co-ancestry between individuals within subpopulations is the only nontrivial quantity. Thus the population structure can be fully described either by F(ST) or F(IS), as F(ST) = -F(IS)/(1 - F(IS)). We show that, for most of the parameter space considered, including simulations where equilibrium is not reached and/or where homoplasy is high, the number of effective migrants is most accurately estimated as Nm = -(1 + F(IS))/4F(IS). We further propose a criterion to test for the absence of cryptic sexual reproduction based on the F-statistics F(IS) and F(ST), which is applied to three previously published empirical data sets.

TI Comparative host-parasite population structures: disentangling
   prospecting and dispersal in the black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla
AB Although much insight is to be gained through the comparison of the population genetic structures of parasites and hosts, there are, at present, few studies that take advantage of the information on vertebrate life histories available through the consideration of their parasites. Here, we examined the genetic structure of a colonial seabird, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) using seven polymorphic microsatellite markers to make inferences about population functioning and intercolony dispersal. We sampled kittiwakes from 22 colonies across the species' range and, at the same time, collected individuals of one of its common ectoparasites, the tick Ixodes uriae. Parasites were genotyped at eight microsatellite markers and the population genetic structure of host and parasite were compared. Kittiwake populations are only genetically structured at large spatial scales and show weak patterns of isolation by distance. This may be due to long-distance dispersal events that erase local patterns of population subdivision. However, important additional information is gained by comparing results with those of the parasite. In particular, tick populations are strongly structured at regional scales and show a stepping-stone pattern of gene flow. Due to the parasite's life history, its population structure is directly linked to the frequency and spatial extent of within-breeding season movements of kittiwakes. The comparison of host and parasite gene flow therefore helps us to disentangle the intercolony movements of birds from that of true dispersal events (movement followed by reproduction). In addition, such data can provide essential elements for predicting the outcome of local co-evolutionary interactions.

TI Frequent detection of polyomaviruses in stool samples from hospitalized
   children
AB Background. Infection with BK virus (BKV) generally occurs early during life, but its mode of transmission has not been clearly defined. We tested the hypothesis that polyomavirus shedding in stool may be a source of BKV exposure.
   Methods. Pediatric stool and rectal swab samples were tested for the presence of polyomavirus DNA by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that could detect a conserved region in the large T antigen gene of BKV, JC virus (JCV), and simian virus 40 (SV40). The specific viruses detected by this assay were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the PCR amplicons.
   Results. Of 120 samples collected from 99 patients, 54 (45.0%) were positive for polyomavirus DNA. Of the 99 patients, 46 ( 46.5%) had at least 1 positive sample, with 38 (38.4%) positive for BKV and 8 (8.1%) positive for SV40. JCV was not detected. There was no association between polyomavirus fecal shedding and age, sex, race/ethnicity, immune status, or symptoms of gastrointestinal disease in the children studied. The BKV strains detected displayed polymorphisms in the T antigen sequence.
   Conclusions. Polyomaviruses are frequently present in stool samples from hospitalized children. These findings suggest that fecal-oral transmission of BKV may play a role in the ubiquity of infection.

TI The effect of host heterogeneity and parasite intragenornic interactions
   on parasite population structure
AB Understanding the processes that shape the genetic structure of parasite populations and the functional consequences of different parasite genotypes is critical for our ability to predict how an infection can spread through a host population and for the design of effective vaccines to combat infection and disease. Here, we examine how the genetic structure of parasite populations responds to host genetic heterogeneity. We consider the well-characterized molecular specificity of major histocompatibility complex binding of antigenic peptides to derive deterministic and stochastic models. We use these models to ask, firstly, what conditions favour the evolution of generalist parasite genotypes versus specialist parasite genotypes? Secondly, can parasite genotypes coexist in a population? We find that intragenomic interactions between parasite loci encoding antigenic peptides are pivotal in determining the outcome of evolution. Where parasite loci interact synergistically (i.e. the recognition of additional antigenic peptides has a disproportionately large effect on parasite fitness), generalist parasite genotypes are favoured. Where parasite loci act multiplicatively (have independent effects on fitness) or antagonistically (have diminishing effects on parasite fitness), specialist parasite genotypes are favoured. A key finding is that polymorphism is not stable and that, with respect to functionally important antigenic peptides, parasite populations are dominated by a single genotype.

TI Comparative trends of seroprevalence and seroincidence rates of human T
   cell lymphotropic virus type I and human immunodeficiency virus 1 in
   pregnant women of various ethnic groups sharing the same environment in
   French Guiana
AB The objectives of this study were to compare the seroprevalence and seroincidence rates of human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in pregnant women in several ethnic groups in French Guiana between July 1, 1991 and June 30, 2001. This study was conducted in the obstetrics unit of the hospital in Saint Laurent du Maroni in a dynamic cohort of 6,921 pregnant women with 11,679 deliveries, with new entrants each year. The overall seroprevalence of HTLV for all women differed between ethnic groups and was restricted mainly to the descendents of fugitive slaves of African origin known as Noir-Marron (181 of 4,266, 4.24%) and to Haitian women (12 of 287, 4.18%). A decrease in the biennial seroprevalence of HTLV-1 was observed over time among deliveries of the Haitian women (P = 0.037), but it remained stable among Noir-Marron (P = 0.22). Fifteen of the 17 HTLV-1 seroconversions occurred in the Noir-Marron, giving an incidence of 0.18 per 100 person-years. The overall seroprevalence of HIV-1 was higher in the Haitian women (10 of 293, 3.41%) than in the Noir-Marron (34 of 4,310, 0.79%) and Amerindians (4 of 552, 0.72%). A highly significant increase in the biennial seroprevalence of HIV-1 was observed among the deliveries of the Noir-Marron (P = 0.0003), but it remained stable among Haitian women (P = 0.44). Ten of the 13 HIV-1 seroconversions were observed in Noir-Marron, giving an incidence rate of 0.12 per 100 person-years. These data demonstrate the differential spreading of these two human retroviruses among pregnant women in different ethnic groups living in the same environment. While HTLV-1, which is highly endemic in groups of African origin, showed a slight decrease over time in a suspected cohort effect, HIV-1 spread rapidly in an epidemic mode, especially in the groups of the lowest socioeconomic levels.

AB Observations on Plasmodium simium infections in Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis monkeys suggest that this host-parasite combination would be a suitable model for the testing of candidate vaccines against Plasmodium vivax. To evaluate the normal course of infections, parasitemia in 52 splenectomized S. boliviensis boliviensis monkeys infected with P. simium were analyzed. The mean maximum parasite count for 31 monkeys after injection with trophozoite-infected erythrocytes was 77,580/mu L. Twenty-one monkeys were infected via sporozoites, and prepatent periods ranged from 14 to 24 days with a median of 15 days. The mean maximum parasite count was 29,234/mu L. The mean maximum parasite count for monkeys previously infected with Old World P. vivax was 26,337/mu L versus 56,362/mu L for those previously infected with New World P. vivax, possibly suggesting a closer antigenic relationship between P. simium and the Old World parasites.

TI Hidden effects of chronic tuberculosis in African buffalo
AB Infectious diseases can bring, about population declines and local host extinctions, contributing significantly to the global biodiversity crisis. Nonetheless, studies measuring population-level effects of pathogens in wild host populations are rare, and taxonomically biased toward avian hosts and macroparasitic infections. We investigated the effects of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by the bacterial pathogen. Mycobacterium bovis, on African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. We tested 1180 buffalo for bTB infection between May 2000 and November 2001. Most infections were mild, confirming the chronic nature of the disease in buffalo. However, our data indicate that bTB affects both adult survival and fecundity. Using an age-structured population model, we demonstrate that the pathogen can reduce population growth rate drastically; yet its effects appear difficult to detect at the population level: bTB causes no conspicuous mass mortalities or fast population declines, nor does it alter host-population age structure significantly. Our models suggest that this syndrome-low detectability coupled with severe impacts on population growth rate and, therefore, resilience-may be characteristic of chronic diseases in large mammals.

TI Neutral drift and polymorphism in gene-for-gene systems
AB Pathogens are a main driving force of the evolution of plants and animals. Being resistant to diseases confers a high selective advantage to hosts, yet many host-pathogen systems show a remarkable degree of polymorphism of host resistance and pathogen virulence. The most common explanation of this phenomenon is that both resistance and virulence genes are costly and that there is selection against those genes when they are unnecessary. Here, we use stochastic multi-locus simulations to show that the origin and the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in plant-pathogen systems can be explained without costs. In multi-locus gene-for-gene systems, temporal domination of a super pathogen can cause polymorphism in resistance through neutral drift. With an increasing number of susceptible alleles in the host population, pathogen types other than the super race are able to cause infections and invade the population, leading to higher pathogen diversity and in turn to higher host diversity.

TI Canine rabies ecology in southern Africa
AB Rabies is a widespread disease in African domestic dogs and certain wild canine populations. Canine rabies became established in Africa during the 20th century, coinciding with ecologic changes that favored its emergence in canids. I present a conceptual and terminologic framework for understanding rabies ecology in African canids. The framework is underpinned by 2 distinct concepts: maintenance and persistence. Maintenance encompasses the notion of indefinite transmission of infection within a local population and depends on an average transmission ratio >= 1. Maintenance in all local populations is inherently unstable, and the disease frequently becomes extinct. Persistence, the notion of long-term continuity, depends on the presence of rabies in >= 1 local population within the canine metapopulation at any time. The implications for understanding rabies ecology and control are reviewed, as are previous studies on rabies ecology in African canids.

TI Achieving operational hydrologic monitoring of mosquitoborne disease

If local hydrologic conditions can be monitored or modeled at the scales at which these conditions affect the population dynamics of vector mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit, a means for monitoring or modeling mosquito populations and mosquitoborne disease transmission may be realized. We review how hydrologic conditions have been associated with mosquito abundances and mosquitoborne disease transmission and discuss the advantages of different measures of hydrologic variability. We propose that the useful application of any measure of hydrologic conditions requires additional consideration of the scales for both the hydrologic measurement and the vector control interventions that will be used to mitigate an outbreak of vectorborne disease. Our efforts to establish operational monitoring of St. Louis encephalitis virus and West Nile virus transmission in Florida are also reviewed.

AB New York State used the health commerce system to monitor the number of West Nile virus (WNV) human disease cases and the density of dead crows. In each year from 2001 to 2003 and for the 3 years combined, persons living in New York counties (excluding New York City) with elevated weekly dead crow densities (above a threshold value of 0.1 dead crows per square mile) had higher risk (2.0-8.6 times) for disease caused by WNV within the next 2 weeks than residents of counties reporting fewer dead crows per square mile. This type of index can offer a realtime, relatively inexpensive window into viral activity in time for prevention and control. Changes in reporting, bird populations, and immunity may require that thresholds other than 0.1 be used in later years or in other areas.

Relative risks for malaria in HIV-infected persons, derived from literature review, were applied to the HIV-infected population in each country, by age group, stratum of CD4 cell count, and urban versus rural residence. Distributions of CD4 counts among HIV-infected persons were modeled assuming a linear decline in CD4 after seroconversion. Averaged across 41 countries, the impact of HIV-1 was limited (although quan- titatively uncertain) because of the different geographic distributions and contrasting age patterns of the 2 diseases. However, in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, South Africa, and Namibia, the incidence of clinical malaria increased by <= 28% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14%47%) and death increased by <= 114% (95% Cl 37%-188%). These effects were due to high HIV-1 prevalence in rural areas and the locally unstable nature of malaria transmission that results in a high proportion of adult cases.

TI Higher disease prevalence can induce greater sociality: A game theoretic
   coevolutionary model
AB There is growing evidence that communicable diseases constitute a strong selective force on the evolution of social systems. It has been suggested that infectious diseases may determine upper limits of host sociality by, for example, inducing territoriality or early juvenile dispersal. Here we use game theory to model the evolution of host sociality in the context of communicable diseases. Our model is then augmented with the evolution of virulence to determine coevolutionarily stable strategies of host sociality and pathogen virulence. In contrast to a controversial hypothesis by Ewald (1994), our analysis indicates that pathogens may become more virulent when contact rates are low, and their prevalence can ultimately induce greater sociality.

TI Multiple infections alter density dependence in host-pathogen
   interactions
AB 1. The hypothesis that multiple infections might disrupt or alter the density-dependent processes regulating a host-pathogen interaction is explored using time series from a well-known laboratory insect-pathogen model system.
   2. We compare the population dynamics of the same host (Plodia interpunctella) infected with a single (granulovirus) or multiple (granulovirus and nucleopolyhedrovirus) pathogens and show how the dynamical fluctuations are altered by the presence of this second pathogen.
   3. Using a maximum likelihood-based approach, we explore the density-dependent mechanisms underpinning the host-pathogen interaction. These regulatory processes differ between single and multiple infections. In singly infected systems, the density-dependent mechanisms of regulation operate through birth rate while in doubly infected systems, density dependence is mediated through death rate.
   4. Further, these deterministic dynamics are modulated by the effects of demographic stochasticity. This stochastic process, the overall sum of individual probabilities of births, deaths and infection influence the changes in population size. In the Plodia-granulovirus system, nonlinear density-dependent births coupled with demographic noise is the necessary prerequisite for the observed dynamics. In the multiple infection system, noise acts together with disease transmission and mortality to affect the population dynamics.
   5. We discuss the implication of these differing regulatory processes in the different-sized species assemblages in the presence of noise for understanding the ecologies of host-pathogen interactions.

TI Species abundance and the distribution of specialization in
   host-parasite interaction networks
AB 1. Recent studies have evaluated the distribution of specialization in species interaction networks. Species abundance patterns have been hypothesized to determine observed topological patterns. We evaluate this hypothesis in the context of host-parasite interaction networks.
   2. We used two independent series of data sets, one consisting of data for seven sites describing interactions between freshwater fish and their metazoan parasites and another consisting of data for 25 localities describing interactions between fleas and their mammalian hosts. We evaluated the influence of species abundance patterns on the distribution of specialization in these host-parasite interaction networks with the aid of null models.
   3. In parallel with recent studies of plant-animal mutualistic networks, our analyses suggest that host-parasite interactions in these systems are highly asymmetric: specialist parasites tend to interact with hosts with high parasite richness, whereas hosts with low parasite richness tend to interact mainly with generalist parasites.
   4. The observed distribution of specialization was predicted by a null model that assumed that species-specific probabilities of being assigned a link during the randomization process were roughly proportional to their relative abundance. Thus, abundant hosts tend to harbour richer parasite faunas, with a high proportion of rare specialists.

TI The anther smut disease on Gypsophila repens: a case of parasite
   sub-optimal performance following a recent host shift?
AB The study of how parasites adapt to new hosts is of great importance for understanding the emergence of new diseases. Here, we report a study of the anther smut disease on Gypsophila repens (Caryophyllaceae). In contrast to what is usually found on other host species, infected natural populations of G. repens are extremely rare. Moreover, symptoms of diseased plants are incomplete and highly variable over the time. These results suggest that the fungus infecting G. repens is a case of a parasite not capable of exploiting its host optimally. Molecular analyses of Microbotryum violaceum strains infecting this and other Caryophyllaceae revealed that this sub-optimal behaviour probably resulted from a recent host shift from the morphologically similar plant Petrorhagia saxifraga. With its exceptionally low virulence and prevalence, but apparent self-sustainability, the disease on G. repens may thus represent an interesting case study for investigating the conditions leading to adaptation of parasites on new hosts.

TI Elevated T cell counts and RANTES expression in the genital mucosa of

AB The initial site of exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 during heterosexual transmission occurs in the genital tract. Although the majority of immunological studies have focused on the immune response to HIV-1 at the systemic level, our understanding of tissue-specific immunity is deficient. The goal of the present study was to characterize T cell populations found in the cervix of women shown to be resistant to infection by HIV-1. Levels of both systemic and cervical mucosal lymphocytes were compared between HIV-1-resistant, HIV-1-uninfected, and HIV-1-infected commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control subjects at low risk for exposure. The HIV-1-resistant CSWs had increased cervical CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell counts, compared with the HIV-1-uninfected CSWs; importantly, these increases were not reflected in the systemic lymphocyte compartment. There was a 2-fold increase in CD4(+) T cell counts in the HIV-1-resistant CSWs, compared with both the HIV-1-infected and the HIV-1-uninfected CSWs. Expression of the HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 was also determined, and cytokine and beta chemokine levels in the genital mucosa were assessed. The HIV-1-resistant CSWs had a 10-fold increase in RANTES expression, compared with the HIV-1-uninfected CSWs. This is the first study to show elevated levels of b chemokines and CD4(+) T cells in the genital tracts of women who are exposed to HIV-1 and yet are uninfected.

TI Norway rat population in Baltimore, Maryland, 2004
AB Norway rats are reservoirs for several zoonotic agents, including hantaviruses, and are implicated in the transmission of pathogens to humans in urban environments. The rat population of Baltimore, Maryland was estimated from surveys in 1949 and again in 1952, but has not been evaluated for more than 50 years. Previously identified sociodemographic risk factors for rat infestation, including median income, human density, and percentage of rental properties, were used to categorize census block groups in Baltimore. Rat infestation risk factors, including median income and human density, have improved over the last 50 years in Baltimore. Rat infestation was determined both by observation and trapping of rats in alleys that were representative of the different strata of risk factors. Despite improvements in risk factors, the outdoor, residential rat population of Baltimore in 2004 was estimated to be approximately 48,420 +/- 14,883 rats, which is comparable to the 1949 and 1952 estimates. Approximately half of the rats trapped in Baltimore City had detectable antibody against Seoul virus. The failure to substantially impact rat population levels in the past 50 years indicate that alternative control strategies for rat infestation are needed to reduce the risk of rat-borne pathogen spillover to the human population.

TI The effect of disease life history on the evolutionary emergence of
   novel pathogens
AB We present a general analytical result for the probability that a newly introduced pathogen will evolve adaptations that allow it to maintain itself within any novel host population, as a function of disease life-history parameters. We demonstrate that this probability of 'evolutionary emergence' depends on two key properties of the disease life history: (i) the basic reproduction number and (ii) the expected duration of an infection. These parameters encapsulate all of the relevant information and can be combined in a very simple expression, with estimates for the rates of adaptive mutation, to predict the probability of emergence for any novel pathogen. In general, diseases that initially have a large reproductive number and/or that cause relatively long infections are the most prone to evolutionary adaptation.

TI Finding needles in the haystack: Single copy microsatellite loci for
   Aedes japonicus (Diptera : Culicidae)
AB First identified in three North American states in 1998, Aedes japonicus japonicus, the Asian bush mosquito, has since spread to 21 states, plus Ontario in Canada, northern France, and Belgium. Analyses of the introduction and expansion of this potentially deadly disease vector will be radically improved by including powerful genetic markers like microsatellites. Useful microsatellite loci have, however, been difficult to identify for mosquitoes in the genus Aedes because of the high amount of repetitive DNA in these species. We isolated single-copy DNA from Ae. j. japonicus and then used a standard enrichment method to identify regions containing microsatellites. Here we describe seven polymorphic microsatellite loci that were tested in American populations of Ae. j. japonicus. These loci were also found to be polymorphic in two other of the four Ae. japonicus subspecies and in Aedes koreicus.

TI Inconclusiveness of chytridiomycosis as the agent in widespread frog
   declines
AB Although there is considerable evidence to support the hypothesis that the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is the primary agent responsible for widespread declines in amphibian populations, particularly rainforest frog populations in Australia and Central America, I argue the case has not yet been made conclusively. Few specimens were collected at the time of population declines, so it may never be possible to conclusively determine their cause. It remains unclear whether the pathogen is novel where declines have occurred. Although it is not necessary that the infection be novel for it to be implicated in declines, if a preexisting pathogen has only recently caused extinctions, cofactors must be important. Whether the pattern of outbreaks represents a "wave" of extinctions is unclear, but if it does, the rate of spread in Australia is implausibly high for a waterborne pathogen, given the most likely estimates of epidemiological parameters. Although B. dendrobatidis is an amphibian pathogen according to Koch's postulates, the postulates are neither necessary nor sufficient criteria to identify a pathogen. The following key pieces of information are necessary to better understand the impact of this fungus on frog communities: better knowledge of the means and rate of transmission under field conditions, prevalence of infection among frog populations, as distinct from morbid individuals, and the effect of the fungus on frogs in the wild. It is crucial to determine whether there are strains of the fungus with differing pathogenicity to particular frog species and whether host-pathogen coevolution has occurred or is occurring. Recently developed diagnostic tools bring into reach the possibility of addressing these questions and thus developing appropriate strategies to manage frog communities that may be affected by this fungus.

TI The novel and endemic pathogen hypotheses: Competing explanations for
   the origin of emerging infectious diseases of wildlife
AB Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium. dendrobatidis, is an emerging infectious disease implicated in declines of amphibian populations around the globe. An emerging infectious disease is one that has recently been discovered; has recently increased in incidence, geography, or host range; or is newly evolved. For any given outbreak of an emerging disease, it is therefore possible to state two hypotheses regarding its origin. The novel pathogen hypothesis states that the disease has recently spread into new geographic areas, whereas the endemic pathogen hypothesis suggests that it has been present in the environment but recently has increased in host range or pathogenicity. Distinguishing between these hypotheses is important, because the conservation measures needed to slow or stop the spread of a novel pathogen are likely to differ from those needed to prevent outbreaks of an endemic pathogen. Population genetics may help discriminate among the possible origins of an emerging disease. Current evidence suggests chytridiomycosis may be a novel pathogen being spread worldwide by carriers, until we know how much genetic variation to expect in an endemic strain, however, we cannot yet conclude that B. dendrobatidis is a novel pathogen.

TI Ecology of chytridiomycosis in rainforest stream frog assemblages of
   tropical Queensland
AB In the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia, eight species of stream-dwelling frogs have experienced population declines. Some declines were associated with an emerging infectious disease of amphibians (chytridiomycosis) caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We examined the spatial and temporal pattern of infection prevalence in a sample of frog populations. Infected adults and tadpoles of all species were found, and infections occurred at every site. Infection prevalence varied among species and was always < 10.0% in adults but ranged from 0.75 to 76.0% in tadpoles. In this system tadpoles and adults of some species may act as disease reservoirs, experiencing avirulent infections, whereas other hosts (declining species) experience virulent infections. Infection prevalence was higher during the cool, dry winter season (May to September) and at high elevations (600-800 m), suggesting regulation by environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation. We found no relationships between infection prevalence and mean body condition, fluctuating asymmetry of hind limbs, population density, or the presence of metamorphosing tadpoles and juvenile frogs. Although it is not certain whether chytridiomycosis was responsible for past frog population declines in the wet tropics of Queensland, the pathogen is now endemic. Our data indicate that at the landscape level, environmental conditions have strong effects on host-pathogen dynamics. These effects interact with species-specific behavior or immune function and may be important underlying determinants of chytridiomycosis epizootics and emergence.

TI Evolution of H5N1 avian influenza viruses in Asia
AB An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) has recently spread to poultry in 9 Asian countries. H5N1 infections have caused >= 52 human deaths in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia from January 2004 to April 2005. Genomic analyses of H5N1 isolates from birds and humans showed 2 distinct clades with a nonoverlapping geographic distribution. All the viral genes were of avian influenza origin, which indicates absence of reassortment with human influenza viruses. All human H5N1 isolates tested belonged to a single clade and were resistant to the adamantane drugs but sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors. Most H5N1 isolates from humans were antigenically homogeneous and distinct from avian viruses circulating before the end of 2003. Some 2005 isolates showed evidence of antigenic drift. An updated nonpathogenic H5N1 reference virus, lacking the polybasic cleavage site in the hemagglutinin gene, was produced by reverse genetics in anticipation of the possible need to vaccinate humans.

TI Plasmodium falciparum spatial analysis, western Kenya highlands
AB We carried out a population-based study to determine the unbiased, age-specific Plasmodium falciparum prevalence, asexual and sexual parasite density, and spatial distribution to establish rates of infection at a site in western Kenya. Three cross-sectional surveys were carried out in western Kenya highlands. Blood samples were taken from 1,388 persons from 6 months to 75 years of age. Parasite prevalence and densities in the population decreased with age and distance from valley bottoms. Children from 1 to 4 years of age had the highest parasite prevalence (38.8%-62.8%); in adults, prevalence declined to 2.9%-24.1%. Malaria prevalence declined by an average of 19% from July to December 2002 across age groups. These observations suggest that parasite transmission is intense at this altitude. Asexual parasite density indicated clustering near major vector breeding habitats. Variability in seasonal prevalence indicates transmission instability and susceptibility to epidemics.

TI The coevolutionary dynamics of antagonistic interactions mediated by
   quantitative traits with evolving variances
AB Quantitative traits frequently mediate coevolutionary interactions between predator and prey or parasite and host. Previous efforts to understand and predict the coevolutionary dynamics of these interactions have generally assumed that standing genetic variation is fixed or absent altogether. We develop a genetically explicit model of coevolution that bridges the gap between these approaches by allowing genetic variation itself to evolve. Analysis of this model shows that the evolution of genetic variance has important consequences for the dynamics and outcome of coevolution. Of particular importance is our demonstration that coevolutionary cycles can emerge in the absence of stabilizing selection, an outcome not possible in previous models of coevolution mediated by quantitative traits. Whether coevolutionary cycles evolve depends upon the strength of selection, the number of loci, and the rate of mutation in each of the interacting species. Our results also generate novel predictions for the expected sign and magnitude of linkage disequilibria in each species.

TI Deciphering host migrations and origins by means of their microbes
AB Mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite sequences are powerful genetic markers for inferring the genealogy and the population genetic structure of animals but they have only limited resolution for organisms that display low genetic variability due to recent strong bottlenecks. An alternative source of data for deciphering migrations and origins in genetically uniform hosts can be provided by some of their microbes, if their evolutionary history correlates closely with that of the host. In this review, we first discuss how a variety of viruses, and the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, can be used as genetic tracers for one of the most intensively studied species, Homo sapiens. Then, we review statistical problems and limitations that affect the calculation of particular population genetic parameters for these microbes, such as mutation rates, with particular emphasis on the effects of recombination, selection and mode of transmission. Finally, we extend the discussion to other host-parasite systems and advocate the adoption of an integrative approach to both sampling and analysis.

TI Prevalence and penetrance variation of male-killing Wolbachia across
   Indo-Pacific populations of the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina
AB Male-killing bacteria are generally thought to attain low to intermediate prevalence in natural populations, with only mild effects on the host population sex ratio. This view was recently challenged by reports of extremely high infection frequencies in three butterfly species, raising the prospect that male killers, by making males rare, might drive many features of host ecology and evolution. To assess this hypothesis, it is necessary to evaluate how often male killers actually produce a highly female-biased population sex ratio in nature, which requires both high prevalence of infection and high penetrance of action. To this end, we surveyed South Pacific and Southeast Asian populations of Hypolimnas bolina, a butterfly in which extreme prevalence of male-killing Wolbachia bacteria has recently been recorded. Our results indicate that highly female-biased populations are common in Polynesia, with 6 out of 12 populations studied having in excess of 70% of females infected with a fully efficient male killer. However, heterogeneity is extreme in Polynesia, with the male-killing Wolbachia absent from three populations. In contrast to the Polynesian situation, Wolbachia does not kill males in any of the three Southeast Asian populations studied, despite its very high prevalence there. We conclude that male killers are likely to have significant ongoing ecological and evolutionary impact in 6 of the 15 populations surveyed. The causes and consequences of the observed spatial variation are discussed with respect to host resistance evolution, host ecology and interference with additional symbionts.

TI Origin and diversification of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni
AB Schistosoma mansoni is the most widespread of the human-infecting schistosomes, present in 54 countries, predominantly in Africa, but also in Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Neotropics. Adult-stage parasites that infect humans are also occasionally recovered from baboons, rodents, and other mammals. Larval stages of the parasite are dependent upon certain species of freshwater snails in the genus Biomphalaria, which largely determine the parasite's geographical range. How S. mansoni genetic diversity is distributed geographically and among isolates using different hosts has never been examined with DNA sequence data. Here we describe the global phylogeography of S. mansoni using more than 2500 bp of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 143 parasites collected in 53 geographically widespread localities. Considerable within-species mtDNA diversity was found, with 85 unique haplotypes grouping into five distinct lineages. Geographical separation, and not host use, appears to be the most important factor in the diversification of the parasite. East African specimens showed a remarkable amount of variation, comprising three clades and basal members of a fourth, strongly suggesting an East African origin for the parasite 0.30-0.43 million years ago, a time frame that follows the arrival of its snail host. Less but still substantial variation was found in the rest of Africa. A recent colonization of the New World is supported by finding only seven closely related New World haplotypes which have West African affinities. All Brazilian isolates have nearly identical mtDNA haplotypes, suggesting a founder effect from the establishment and spread of the parasite in this large country.

TI Behavioural manipulation in a grasshopper harbouring hairworm: a
   proteomics approach
AB The parasitic Nematomorph hairworm, Spinochordodes tellinii (Camerano) develops inside the terrestrial grasshopper, Meconema thalassinum (De Geer) (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae), changing the insect's responses to water. The resulting aberrant behaviour makes infected insects more likely to jump into an aquatic environment where the adult parasite reproduces. We used proteomics tools (i.e. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), computer assisted comparative analysis of host and parasite protein spots and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry) to identify these proteins and to explore the mechanisms underlying this subtle behavioural modification. We characterized simultaneously the host (brain) and the parasite proteornes at three stages of the manipulative process, i.e. before, during and after manipulation. For the host, there was a differential proteomic expression in relation to different effects such as the circadian cycle, the parasitic status, the manipulative period itself, and worm emergence. For the parasite, a differential proteomics expression allowed characterization of the parasitic and the free-living stages, the manipulative period and the emergence of the worm from the host. The findings suggest that the adult worm alters the normal functions of the grasshopper's central nervous system (CNS) by producing certain 'effective' molecules. In addition, in the brain of manipulated insects, there was found to be a differential expression of proteins specifically linked to neurotransmitter activities. The evidence obtained also suggested that the parasite produces molecules from the family Writ acting directly on the development of the CNS. These proteins show important similarities with those known in other insects, suggesting a case of molecular mimicry. Finally, we found many proteins in the host's CNS as well as in the parasite for which the function(s) are still unknown in the published literature (www) protein databases. These results support the hypothesis that host behavioural changes are mediated by a mix of direct and indirect chemical manipulation.

TI Dynamics of multiple infection and within-host competition in
   genetically diverse malaria infections
AB Within-host competition between coinfecting parasite strains shapes the evolution of parasite phenotypes such as virulence and drug resistance. Although this evolution has a strong theoretical basis, within-host competition has rarely been studied experimentally, particularly in medically relevant pathogens with hosts that have pronounced specific and nonspecific immune responses against coinfecting strains. We investigated multiple infection in malaria, using two pairs of genetically distinct clones of the rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi in mice. Clones were inoculated into mice simultaneously or 3 or 11 days apart, and population sizes were tracked using immunofluorescence or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In all experiments, at least one of the two clones suffered strong competitive suppression, probably through both resource- and immune-mediated ( apparent) competition. Clones differed in intrinsic competitive ability, but prior residency was also an important determinant of competitive outcome. When clones infected mice first, they did not suffer from competition, but they did when infecting mice at the same time or after their competitor, more so the later they infected their host. Consequently, clones that are competitively inferior in head-to-head competition can be competitively superior if they infect hosts first. These results are discussed in the light of strain-specific immunity, drug resistance, and virulence evolution theory.

TI Diversification of transmission modes and the evolution of mutualism
AB In order for mutualism to evolve, some force must align the interests of the two interacting partners. Vertical transmission can fill this role, but it is still unknown whether mutualism can be stable when vertically transmitted symbionts can evolve toward horizontal transmission. In this article, we investigate how symbionts' transmission mode and virulence should evolve, depending on the relationship between these two traits. We show that pathogens that reduce their host's fecundity can have more complex evolutionary dynamics than those that increase mortality. In some cases, runaway evolution of virulence can drive the host population extinct. In most cases, evolutionary branching results in the differentiation of avirulent, vertically transmitted symbionts from virulent, contagious pathogens. The population of symbionts then becomes polymorphic, and because the least virulent symbionts are the most frequent, the average virulence of symbionts is much lower than it would be in a monomorphic population. When the link between transmission and virulence results from correlated mutational changes and not from fixed constraints, vertically transmitted symbionts do not simply lose virulence; they evolve toward mutualism. We show that the force that stabilizes mutualism in such situations is the competition for transmission between symbionts.

TI Local adaptation and population structure at a micro-geographical scale
   of a fungal parasite on its host plant
AB Local adaptation, which has been detected for several wild pathosystems is influenced by gene flow and recombination. In this study, we investigate local adaptation and population structure at a fine scale in wild populations of a plant-pathogen fungus. We sampled hierarchically strains of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum in a wild population of its host. The analysis of AFLP patterns obtained for 86 strains indicated that: (i) many different haplotypes can be discriminated, although occurrence of recombination could not be shown; (ii) migration between adjacent plants seemed rare during the season; and (iii) neutral diversity is structured according to groups of plants and individual host plants. Furthermore, we tested for the occurrence of local adaptation using a cross-inoculation experiment. Our results showed local adaptation at the scale of the individual host plant. These results indicate that fine-scale dynamics has evolutionary consequences in this pathosystem.

   geographic expansion of Medicago
AB The legume genus Medicago interacts with soil bacteria commonly referred to as rhizobia, in a nitrogen fixing symbiosis. We analysed the diversity of symbiotic association specificity among the two organisms, and its evolution in the plant genus. Nitrogen fixation tests and molecular phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that the genus Medicago includes more symbiotic specificity groups than previously suggested and that plant specificity is highly unstable and has repeatedly switched along the diversification of this genus. A phylogenetic analysis including geographical data shows that bacterial geographical diversity distribution has a strong influence on the geographic distribution of plant species and their ability to colonize new areas. Multiple other modifications of specificity occurred along the diversification of the genus, presumably due to selection for specialization to a single bacterial biovar. Codivergence between plants and bacteria may also have taken place.

TI Molecular evidence for host specificity of parasitic nematode
   microfilariae in some African rainforest birds
AB Here we describe, determine the prevalence, and examine the host-specificity of some parasitic nematode microfilariae in selected bird species from West and Central Africa. We used microscopy to determine the prevalence of microfilariae in 969 host individuals representing 121 rainforest bird species from Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire and Equatorial Guinea. Thirteen (11%) of these potential host species harboured microfilariae, and 35 individuals (3.6%) were infected. From the 35 infected individuals, we identified eight distinct morphological microfilarial forms. Sixteen of the 35 infected individuals were of one host species, the Fire-crested Alethe (Alethe diademata), at a prevalence rate of 62%. To examine host and geographical specificity, we sequenced a portion of the LSU rDNA gene from representative microfilariae drawn from different hosts and collecting locations. Identical sequences of the nematode LSU rDNA gene were found in A. diademata collected from locations in Cote d'Ivoire and Equatorial Guinea, locations separated by the Dahomey Gap and associated with different hypothesized refugial areas. In contrast, several other bird species collected at the same sites harboured different microfilaria lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial ATP synthase genes of the host species A. diademata, and found a 5.4% sequence divergence between the birds sampled in Cote d'Ivoire, and those from Cameroon. Thus, despite this split between the two populations, they harbour microfilariae with identical lineages. These data provide evidence that the microfilariae found in A. diademata may be highly host specific. This apparent specificity may have important implications for the evolutionary and ecological interactions between parasitic nematodes and their avian hosts.

TI Resistance to abomasal nematodes and individual genetic variability in
   reindeer
AB Resistance to parasites is believed to have a widespread influence on demographic and adaptive processes. In systems where parasites impose a fitness cost on their host, heterozygotes may be selected because they are more resistant to parasites than homozygotes. Our objective was to assess the relationships between genomewide individual heterozygosity and abomasal nematode burdens in female Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) after the effects of host age, locality, season, and year had been accounted for. Samples were obtained from 306 female reindeer that were culled and genotyped at nine microsatellite loci. Reindeer in our study populations are mainly parasitized by the gastrointestinal nematodes Ostertagia gruehneri and Marshallagia marshalli. The infection intensity of each parasite differed between subpopulations, and among host age classes, seasons and years. We found no significant relationships between abomasal worm burdens, or lumen and mucosa larvae, of either O. gruehneri or M. marshalli and individual heterozygosity ( or mean d(2)) alone or in interactions with host age, locality, and year. Although we analysed one of the largest data set available to date on gastrointestinal nematodes of a wild ruminant, we used a typical data set of nine genetic neutral markers that may have had low power to detect heterozygosity-fitness correlations. We conclude that the proportion of the variance in parasite resistance explained by individual heterozygosity for neutral genetic markers is low in Svalbard reindeer and in vertebrates in general, and we suggest that the candidate-gene approach might be more fruitful for further research on gene-fitness correlations.

TI A guild of 45 CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families and multiple
   CRISPR/Cas subtypes exist in prokaryotic genomes
AB Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are a family of DNA direct repeats found in many prokaryotic genomes. Repeats of 21-37 bp typically show weak dyad symmetry and are separated by regularly sized, nonrepetitive spacer sequences. Four CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families, designated Cas1 to Cas4, are strictly associated with CRISPR elements and always occur near a repeat cluster. Some spacers originate from mobile genetic elements and are thought to confer "immunity" against the elements that harbor these sequences. In the present study, we have systematically investigated uncharacterized proteins encoded in the vicinity of these CRISPRs and found many additional protein families that are strictly associated with CRISPR loci across multiple prokaryotic species. Multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models have been built for 45 Cas protein families. These models identify family members with high sensitivity and selectivity and classify key regulators of development, DevR and DevS, in Myxococcus xanthus as Cas proteins. These identifications show that CRISPR/cas gene regions can be quite large, with up to 20 different, tandem-arranged cas genes next to a repeat cluster or filling the region between two repeat clusters. Distinctive subsets of the collection of Cas proteins recur in phylogenetically distant species and correlate with characteristic repeat periodicity. The analyses presented here support initial proposals of mobility of these units, along with the likelihood that loci of different subtypes interact with one another as well as with host cell defensive, replicative, and regulatory systems. It is evident from this analysis that CRISPR/cas loci are larger, more complex, and more heterogeneous than previously appreciated.

TI Stealth proteins: In silico identification of a novel protein family
   rendering bacterial pathogens invisible to host immune defense
AB There are a variety of bacterial defense strategies to survive in a hostile environment. Generation of extracellular polysaccharides has proved to be a simple but effective strategy against the host's innate immune system. A comparative genomics approach led us to identify a new protein family termed Stealth, most likely involved in the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides. This protein family is characterized by a series of domains conserved across phylogeny from bacteria to eukaryotes. In bacteria, Stealth (previously characterized as SacB, XcbA, or WefC) is encoded by subsets of strains mainly colonizing multicellular organisms, with evidence for a protective effect against the host innate immune defense. More specifically, integrating all the available information about Stealth proteins in bacteria, we propose that Stealth is a D-hexose-l-phosphoryl transferase involved in the synthesis of polysaccharides. In the animal kingdom, Stealth is strongly conserved across evolution from social amoebas to simple and complex multicellular organisms, such as Dictyostelium discoideum, hydra, and human. Based on the occurrence of Stealth in most Eukaryotes and a subset of Prokaryotes together with its potential role in extracellular polysaccharide synthesis, we propose that metazoan Stealth functions to regulate the innate immune system. Moreover, there is good reason to speculate that the acquisition and spread of Stealth could be responsible for future epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by a large variety of eubacterial pathogens. Our in silico identification of a homologous protein in the human host will help to elucidate the causes of Stealth-dependent virulence. At a more basic level, the characterization of the molecular and cellular function of Stealth proteins may shed light on fundamental mechanisms of innate immune defense against microbial invasion.

TI Interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms in a cyclic
   species: testosterone increases parasite infection in red grouse
AB Field studies of mechanisms involved in population regulation have tended to focus on the roles of either intrinsic or extrinsic factors, but these are rarely mutually exclusive and their interactions can be crucial in determining dynamics. Experiments on red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus have shown that population instability can be caused both by the effects of a parasitic nematode, Trichostrongylus tenuis, on host production or by changes in testosterone influencing aggressive behaviour and recruitment. We experimentally tested for an interaction between testosterone and T tennis in free-living male grouse. A total of 123 grouse were caught-in autumn, treated with an anthelmintic to remove parasites, and then given either testosterone or empty, control, implants. After one month grouse were re-infected with a standard dose of parasites. We show that males with increased testosterone levels had greater parasite intensities than controls after one year. We discuss possible physiological and behavioural mechanisms linking testosterone and increased parasite intensity, and the implications for our understanding of complex, unstable population dynamics.

The results of genotyping of these specimens were compared with the results of genotyping of specimens obtained from 384 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults with Pneumocystis pneumonia. P. jirovecii DNA was detected at the mitochondrial large subunit rRNA and dihydropteroate synthase loci in 100% and 53%, respectively, of the specimens obtained from infants. All specimens obtained from adults tested positive for P. jirovecii at both loci. Genotype distributions at both loci were significantly different in the 2 populations (P < .001). The observation of different strains circulating in immunocompetent infants and HIV-infected adults suggests independent transmission cycles that warrant further study.

TI Recurrent evolution of host-specialized races in a globally distributed
   parasite
AB The outcome of coevolutionary interactions is predicted to vary across landscapes depending on local conditions and levels of gene flow, with some populations evolving more extreme specializations than others. Using a globally distributed parasite of colonial seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae, we examined how host availability and geographic isolation influences this process. In particular, we sampled ticks from 30 populations of six different seabird host species, three in the Southern Hemisphere and three in the Northern Hemisphere. We show that parasite races have evolved independently on hosts of both hemispheres. Moreover, the degree of differentiation between tick races varied spatially within each region and suggests that the divergence of tick races is an ongoing process that has occurred multiple times across isolated areas. As I. uriae is vector to the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, these results may have important consequence for the epidemiology of this disease. With the increased occurrence of novel interspecific interactions due to global change, these results also stress the importance of the combined effects of gene flow and selection for parasite diversification.

TI Avian hosts for West Nile Virus in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, 2002
AB West Nile virus (WNV) infections in free-ranging birds were studied in Slidell, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, after a human encephalitis outbreak peaked there in July 2002. Seroprevalence in resident, free-ranging wild birds in one suburban site was 25% and 24% in August and October, respectively, indicating that most transmission had ceased by early August. Mortality rates, seroprevalence rates, host competence, and crude population estimates were used in mathematical models to predict actual infection rates, population impacts, and importance as amplifying hosts for several common passerine birds. Northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and house sparrow (Passer domesticus) were the principal amplifying hosts, but blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) and northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) also contributed. The blue jay population was reduced by an estimated 47%. A variety of passerine bird species combined to play an important role as amplifying hosts in the WNV transmission cycle.

TI A longitudinal study of Bayou virus, hosts, and habitat
AB What is currently known about the ecology of North American hantaviruses has come largely from studies on Sin Nombre virus (SNV). We conducted a longitudinal study of Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-leading agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United States. Antibodies to hantavirus were detected from Oryzomys palustris (most commonly infected species), Sigmodon hispidus, Peroruyscus leucopus, Reithrodontomys fulvescens, and Baiomys taylori. However, only O. palustris had vital RNA in tissues and excreta, suggesting that antibodies detected in other species may have resulted from spill-over infection. Seroprevalence rates averaged around 16% for O. palustris and varied seasonally. The heaviest males exhibited the highest levels of seroprevalence. Seroprevalence was higher in coastal prairie (20.0%) than old-fields (10.5%) and was associated with host abundance. These patterns are similar to those of SNV and can be used in identification of potentially at-risk areas.

TI Health and demographic surveillance in rural western Kenya: A platform
   for evaluating interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from
   infectious diseases
AB We established a health and demographic surveillance system in a rural area of western Kenya to measure the burden of infectious diseases and evaluate public health interventions. After a baseline census, all 33,990 households were visited every four months. We collected data on educational attainment, socioeconomic status, pediatric outpatient visits, causes of death in children, and malaria transmission. The life expectancy at birth was 38 years, the infant mortality rate was 125 per 1000 live births, and the under-five mortality rate was 227 per 1,000 live births. The increased mortality rate in younger men and women suggests high human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related mortality in the population. Of 5,879 sick child visits, the most frequent diagnosis was malaria (71.5%). Verbal autopsy results for 661 child deaths (1 month to < 12 years) implicated malaria (28.9%) and anemia (t9.8%) as the most common causes of death in children. These data will provide a basis for generating further research questions, developing targeted interventions, and evaluating their impact.

TI Acquired immunity and stochasticity in epidemic intervals impede the
   evolution of host disease resistance
AB Disease can generate intense selection pressure on host populations, but here we show that acquired immunity in a population subject to repeated disease outbreaks can impede the evolution of genetic disease resistance by maintaining susceptible genotypes in the population. Interference between the life-history schedule of a species and periodicity of the disease has unintuitive effects on selection intensity, and stochasticity in outbreak period further reduces the rate of spread of disease-resistance alleles. A general age-structured population genetic model was developed and parameterized using empirical data for phocine distemper virus (PDV) epizootics in harbor seals. Scenarios with acquired immunity had lower levels of epizootic mortality compared with scenarios without acquired immunity for the first PDV outbreaks, but this pattern was reversed after about five disease cycles. Without acquired immunity, evolution of disease resistance was more rapid, and long-term population size variation is efficiently dampened. Acquired immunity has the potential to significantly influence rapid evolutionary dynamics of a host population in response to age-structured disease selection and to alter predicted selection intensities compared with epidemiological models that do not consider such feedback. This may have important implications for evolutionary population dynamics in a range of human, agricultural, and wildlife disease settings.

TI Investigating the population-level effects of chytridiomycosis: An
   emerging infectious disease of amphibians
AB Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease that has recently been reported in amphibian populations throughout the world. It has been associated with many cases of population declines and extinctions. In some areas of the Sierra Nevada of California the disease appears to be the causal factor in the rapid extinction of local populations of the mountain yellow-legged frog, Rana muscosa, within a few years of the first detection of the disease. In other areas, however, R. muscosa populations appear to persist for many years, despite high levels of infection in tadpoles. Here we present simple models of the dynamics of the disease within an individual lake and ask whether our current understanding of the disease is consistent with the field survey observations of: (a) extinction due to the disease over a wide range of host population sizes, and (b) persistence of frog populations with the disease at some sites. Despite our laboratory observation of chytridiomycosis being invariably lethal to postmetamorphic frogs, the observed long-term persistence of infected frog populations can only be explained if at least some infected adult frogs survive and reproduce.

TI Conserving community modules: A case study of the endangered lycaenid
   butterfly Maculinea alcon
AB We develop a "case model" approach to investigate how conservation measures may affect the ecology of a community module, defined as a small number of tightly interacting species. The community module consists of a parasitic butterfly and its two hosts, a plant and an ant. The butterfly Maculinea alcon and its host plant Gentiana pneumnonanthe have long been used as indicators of high-quality Palearctic heath and moist grassland ecosystems, and both species have been targeted for ecological research and specific conservation management. We constructed a mechanistic model of this community module, including dynamics for the three species, and conducted simulation studies of different conservation strategies (burning, sod cutting, mowing, and grazing). We identified several key parameters for the conservation of Maculinea alcon and its host plant as well as the most efficient conservation strategies for their dual long-term persistence. Our results show that the conditions that optimize the size of the butterfly and the plant populations differ, suggesting that choices must be made in adopting conservation measures. Despite the potential for apparent competition between the ant, Myrmica scabrinodis, and the plant via the butterfly, realized apparent competition is asymmetric (ants are more affected than plants) and occurs only at intermediate successional stages. Our study provides an example whereby an endangered species (the plant) and its endangered specialist natural enemy (the butterfly) are adversely affected by successional dynamics via direct (for the plant) and indirect (for the butterfly) effects. We argue that different field situations will necessitate particular conservation solutions.

TI Amphibian population declines at savannah river site are linked to
   climate, not chytridiomycosis
AB Amphibian populations at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, USA, have been censused consistently for 35 years, and this Provides a time series to examine the causes Of Population fluctuations. We examined archived museum specimens of 15 anuran species collected at wetlands on the SRS for the presence of the causative agent (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) of chytridiomycosis, an emerging disease associated with population declines elsewhere. Infections were present in three out of 137 (2.18%) individuals; the pathogen was detected in two Rana catesbeiana and a single Rana sphenocephala, all collected between 1978 and 1981. Lesions were not consistent with the later stages of fatal chytridiomycosis. Analysis of population trajectories of nine amphibian species over 26 years at SRS showed that four species declined significantly over this period, including R. sphenocephala. However, we demonstrate that these declines are more likely caused by an increase in the number of years with insufficient rainfall and a shortened hydroperiod at the breeding site than by chytrid epidemics. This pattern appears to be linked to a drying trend at SRS through the 1990s, although it is unclear whether this was caused by climate change. This study demonstrates that the presence of B. dendrobatidis in amphibian communities where some species are declining does not always implicate chytrids as a cause of the decline. Like many other emerging pathogens, the outcome of infection can vary among individuals and populations, depending on life history traits, environmental conditions, and virulence factors of the pathogen. Our report also demonstrates the usefulness of archived museum specimens and long-term population monitoring in studying the host-parasite ecology of emerging diseases.

TI Larval competition differentially affects arbovirus infection in Aedes
   mosquitoes
AB Both density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect biotic interactions may be important in structuring communities. Indirect interactions in many study systems remain unexplored; in part, because they are often difficult to detect, and in many instances, have been identified empirically only when unexpected results arise. Indirect effects induced by competition may be particularly important among organisms with complex life cycles, wherein competitive effects experienced in one life stage influence species interactions in one or more subsequent stages. We determined whether species-specific effects of larval competition in the mosquitoes Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti have indirect effects at the adult stage, specifically testing for effects on arboviral infection with Sindbis virus (SINV). For A. albopictus, but not for A. aegypti, competition resulted in greater infection, body titer, and dissemination rates compared to low-competition conditions. Whole body titers of virus increased with adult size irrespective of competition. However, between competitive treatments, mosquitoes from low-competition conditions had greater mean size, with lower infection rates and lower whole body titers than the smaller mosquitoes from high-competition conditions. These results suggest that larval competition, common in natural mosquito populations, has important indirect effects on adults by altering mosquito-virus interactions. Such indirect effects may change transmission parameters of pathogens.

TI Community epidemiology framework for classifying disease threats
AB Recent evidence suggests that most parasites can infect multiple host species and that these are primarily responsible for emerging infectious disease outbreaks in humans and wildlife. However, the ecologic and evolutionary factors that constrain or facilitate such emergences are poorly understood. We propose a conceptual framework based on the pathogen's between- and within-species transmission rates to describe possible configurations of a multihost-pathogen community that may lead to disease emergence. We establish 3 dynamic thresholds separating 4 classes of disease outcomes, spillover, apparent multihost, true multihost, and potential emerging infectious disease; describe possible disease emergence scenarios; outline the population dynamics of each case; and clarify existing terminology. We highlight the utility of this framework with examples of disease threats in human and wildlife populations, showing how it allows us to understand which ecologic factors affect disease emergence and predict the impact of host shifts in a range of disease systems.

TI Host range and emerging and reemerging pathogens
AB An updated literature survey identified 1,407 recognized species of human pathogen, 58% of which are zoonotic. Of the total, 177 are regarded as emerging or reemerging. Zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be in this category as are nonzoonotic pathogens. Emerging and reemerging pathogens are not strongly associated with particular types of nonhuman hosts, but they are most likely to have the broadest host ranges. Emerging and reemerging zoonoses are associated with a wide range of drivers, but changes in land use and agriculture and demographic and societal changes are most commonly cited. However, although zoonotic pathogens do represent the most likely source of emerging and reemerging infectious disease, only a small minority have proved capable of causing major epidemics in the human population.

TI Parasite-host fitness trade-offs change with parasite identity:
   Genotype-specific interactions in a plant-pathogen system
AB Simultaneous effects of host and parasite in determining quantitative traits of infection have long been neglected in theoretical and experimental investigations of host-parasite coevolution with the notable exception of gene-for-gene resistance studies. A cross-infection experiment, using five lines of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and two strains of its oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica, revealed that three traits traditionally considered those of the parasite (number of infected leaves, transmission success, and time until 50% transmission), differed among specific combinations of host and parasite lines, being determined by the two protagonists of the infection. However, the two parasite strains did not differ significantly for most measured phenotypic traits of the infection. Globally, transmission increased with increasing virulence among the different host-parasite combinations, as assumed by most models of evolution of virulence. Surprisingly, however, there was no general relationship between parasite and host fitness, estimated respectively as transmission and seed production. Only one of the two strains showed the expected significant negative genetic correlation between these two variables. Our results thus highlight the importance of taking into account both host and parasite genetic variation because their interaction can lead to unexpected evolutionary outcomes.

TI Intravaginal practices, bacterial vaginosis, and women's susceptibility
   to HIV infection: epidemiological evidence and biological mechanisms
AB Intravaginal practices such as "dry sex" and douching have been suggested as a risk factor that may increase women's susceptibility to HIV infection. These behaviours appear common in different populations across sub-Saharan Africa, where practices include the use of antiseptic preparations, traditional medicines, or the insertion of fingers or cloths into the vagina. We systematically review the evidence for the association between women's intravaginal practices and HIV infection. Although a number of cross-sectional studies have shown that prevalent HIV infection is more common among women reporting intravaginal practices, the temporal nature of this association is unclear. Current evidence suggests that bacterial vaginosis, which is a likely risk factor for HIV infection, may be a mediator of the association between intravaginal practices and HIV. Although biologically plausible mechanisms exist, there is currently little epidemiological evidence suggesting that intravaginal practices increase women's susceptibility to HIV infection. Further research into factors that increase women's susceptibility to HIV will help to inform the design of vaginal microbicides and other HIV prevention interventions.

TI Fluctuating rodent populations and risk to humans from rodent-borne
   zoonoses
AB The fluctuations in abundance of a wildlife reservoir are an attractive explanation for temporal variation in primary human cases of a zoonosis. This is because high abundance may lead to more contact between humans and animals, but also to outbreaks of disease within the reservoir population. We propose a mathematical framework that sets out the consequences of correlation between reservoir abundance and reservoir prevalence for how numbers of human cases are related to reservoir abundance. The fluctuations of rodent populations are well studied and often dramatic. A review of field studies of rodent reservoirs for plague, hantaviruses, and other zoonoses shows that, at a seasonal time scale, a positive correlation between host abundance and host prevalence is rarely observed. More commonly, there is an inverse relationship or negative correlation such that a seasonal increase in rodent abundance is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the abundance of infectious animals. Seasonal changes in rodent abundance are hence unlikely to fully explain seasonal variation in primary human cases. The few longer field studies (>5 years) show a positive but delayed relationship between reservoir abundance and reservoir prevalence.

   concomitant hantavirus in northern Sweden
AB Puumala virus (PUUV), genus hantavirus, causes nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans. In this study, bank voles, the natural reservoir of PUUV, were captured at locations of previous human PUUV exposure and paired controls within a region of high incidence in northern Sweden. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on the abundance of bank voles and the occurrence of PUUV. The total number of voles and the number of PUUV-infected voles did not differ between locations of previous human PUUV exposure and paired controls. The number of bank voles expressing antibodies to PUUV infection increased linearly with total bank vole abundance implying density independent transmission. Using principal component and partial correlation analysis, we found that particular environmental characteristics associated with old-growth moist forests (i.e., those dominated by Alectoria spp., Picea abies, fallen wood, and Vaccinium myrtillus) were also associated with increased abundance of bank vole and hence the number of PUUV-infected bank voles, whereas there were no correlations with factors associated with dry environments (i.e., Pinus sylvestris and V. vitis-idea). This suggests that circulation and persistence of PUUV within bank vole populations was influenced by habitat factors. Future modeling of risk of exposure to hantavirus and transmission of PUUV within vole populations should include the influence of these factors.

TI West Nile virus in host-seeking mosquitoes within a residential
   neighborhood in Grand Forks, North Dakota
AB West Nile virus (WNV) was first recovered in North Dakota near the city of Grand Forks in June 2002. During 2002, 2003, and 2004, we collected mosquitoes from Grand Forks using Mosquito Magnet(TM) traps and tested them for WNV. The seasonal abundance, species composition, and reproductive status of female mosquitoes were correlated with local environmental temperature and state surveillance data on WNV to determine the factors affecting local transmission of WNV. Over 90% of the mosquitoes collected were Aedes vexans, Ochlerotatus dorsalis, and Culex tarsalis, but WNV was detected only in Cx. tarsalis. Average summertime temperatures and relative abundance of mosquitoes were highest in 2002 but no WNV-positive mosquitoes were detected until the following summer. In 2003, nulliparous Cx. tarsalis appeared in mid-June (first summer brood), and parous Cx. tarsalis appeared in mid-July. The first WNV-positive pool occurred 21 July, and minimum daily infections rates increased thereafter until 27 August. The minimum infection rate (MIR) for Cx. tarsalis during the season was 5.7 infected mosquitoes per 1,000 tested, with the highest infection rates occurring at the end of the season as Cx. tarsalis populations started to decline. Mid-to-late August was identified as the period of highest risk for being bitten by a WNV-infected mosquito in Grand Forks during 2003. In 2004, viral activity in Grand Forks was low, due to very cool temperatures throughout the summer. To examine the genetic diversity of the 2003 WNV isolates from Grand Forks, we sequenced a 366-nucleotide region of the capsid and premembrane gene. Thirteen (46%) of the 28 WNV isolates contained at least one nucleotide substitution when compared to the homologous region of the progenitor WN NY-99 strain, and seven of these 13 substitutions coded for amino acid changes. Thus, WNV is established in North Dakota, it appears to be evolving and it is vectored primarily by Cx. tarsalis.

TI Potential vertebrate reservoir hosts and invertebrate vectors of
   Anaplasma marginale and A-phagocytophilum in central Spain
AB Organisms in the genus Anaplasma are obligate intracellular pathogens that multiply in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. The type species, A. marginate, causes bovine anaplasmosis and only infects ticks and ruminants. A. phagocytophilum causes human and animal granulocytic anaplasmosis, and genetically closely related strains show a wide host range, including ticks, ruminants, rodents, equids, canids, birds, and humans. Recent reports demonstrated that A. marginate and A. phagocytophilum co-exist in geographic areas and that concurrent infections occur in ruminants and ticks. In this study, we characterized A. marginate and A. phagocytophilum infections in wild and domestic animals, and ticks collected in central Spain by serology, PCR, and sequence of 16S rRNA genotypes. Species tested included humans, cattle, dogs, rodents, Iberian red deer, European wild boar, birds, and ticks. Species of hematophagous Diptera were analyzed as potential mechanical vectors of Anaplasma spp. A. marginate was detected in tabanids, ticks, cattle, and deer, while A. phagocytophilum was detected in ticks, deer, cattle, and birds. Concurrent infections of the two Anaplasma were found in cattle and deer. These results illustrate the complexity of the epizootiology of A. marginate and A. phagocytophilum in regions where both pathogens co-exist and share common reservoir hosts and vectors. The increasing contact between wildlife, domestic animals, and human populations increases the risk of outbreaks of human and bovine anaplasmosis, and the difficulty of implementing surveillance and control measures.

TI Evolutionary implications of the adaptation to different immune systems
   in a parasite with a complex life cycle
AB Many diseases are caused by parasites with complex life cycles that involve several hosts. If parasites cope better with only one of the different types of immune systems of their host species, we might expect a trade-off in parasite performance in the different hosts, that likely influences the evolution of virulence. We tested this hypothesis in a naturally co-evolving host-parasite system consisting of the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus and its intermediate hosts, a copepod, Macrocyclops albidus, and the three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus. We did not find a trade-off between infection success in the two hosts. Rather, tapeworms seem to trade-off adaptation towards different parts of their hosts' immune systems. Worm sibships that performed better in the invertebrate host also seem to be able to evade detection by the fish innate defence systems, i.e. induce lower levels of activation of innate immune components. These worm variants were less harmful for the fish host likely due to reduced costs of an activated innate immune system. These findings substantiate the impact of both hosts' immune systems on parasite performance and virulence.

Using this model, we show that warming in the Arctic may have already radically altered the transmission dynamics of this parasite, escalating infection pressure for muskoxen, and that this trend is expected to continue. This work establishes a foundation for understanding responses to climate change of other host-parasite systems, in the Arctic and globally.

TI Poor maternal environment enhances offspring disease resistance in an
   invertebrate
AB Natural populations vary tremendously in their susceptibility to infectious disease agents. The factors (environmental or genetic) that underlie this variation determine the impact of disease on host population dynamics and evolution, and affect our capacity to contain disease outbreaks and to enhance resistance in agricultural animals and disease vectors. Here, we show that changes in the environmental conditions under which female Daphnia magna are kept can more than halve the susceptibility of their offspring to bacterial infection. Counter-intuitively, and unlike the effects typically observed in vertebrates for transfer of immunity, mothers producing offspring under poor conditions produced more resistant offspring than did mothers producing offspring in favourable conditions. This effect occurred when mothers who were well provisioned during their own development then found themselves reproducing in poor conditions. These effects likely reflect adaptive optimal resource allocation where better quality offspring ate produced in poor environments to enhance survival. Maternal exposure to parasites also reduced offspring susceptibility, depending on host genotype and offspring food levels. These maternal responses to environmental conditions mean that studies focused on a single generation, and those in which environmental variation is experimentally minimized, may fail to describe the crucial parameters that influence the spread of disease. The large maternal effects we report here will, if they are widespread in nature, affect disease dynamics, the level of genetic polymorphism in populations, and likely weaken the evolutionary response to parasite-mediated selection.

AB Haptoglobin (Hp) levels were investigated in relation to host genotype in a malaria-endemic area in Gabon. A cross-sectional study of 1-12-year-old children was conducted in the rainy season, a period of high malaria transmission, to examine this relationship. Variables that influenced Hp levels were Hp genotype, location, and age interacting with parasite density. At low parasite densities, there was a negative correlation between Hp levels and age. At higher densities, there was a positive correlation with age. This suggests that in the presence of Greater parasite-induced hemolysis, older children are capable of increased production of Hp. Sickle cell trait and ABO blood group was not associated with Hp levels in this population.

In this study, we monitored recombination-based diversity of msp1 in Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, where malaria transmission is high. We identified 5' recombinant types, 3' sequence types, and msp1 haplotypes (unique associations of 5' recombinant types and 3' sequence types), and compared them with those from areas of low transmission in Thailand and Vanuatu. The mean number of 5' recombinant types per person (multiplicity) was lower in Guadalcanal than in Thailand. Guadalcanal populations had 6-8 msp1 haplotypes; the numbers are comparable to Vanuatu but much lower than in Thailand. There were marked geographic differences in distribution Of 171spl haplotypes. Linkage disequilibrium in msp1 was stronger in Guadalcanal than in Thailand, suggesting limited recombination events in the Solomon Islands. We suggest that the frequency of recombination events In msp1 is determined not only by transmission intensity but by the number of msp1 alleles prevalent and multiplicity of infections.

TI Cage trials using an endogenous meiotic drive gene in the mosquito Aedes
   aegypti to promote population replacement
AB Control of arthropod-borne diseases based on population replacement with genetically modified noncompetent vectors has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional control strategies. Due to likely fitness costs associated with vectors manipulated to carry anti-pathogen effector genes, the effector genes will need to be coupled with a strong drive system to rapidly sweep them into natural populations. Endogenous meiotic drive systems have strong and stable population replacement potential, and have previously been reported in two mosquito species: Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens. To investigate the influence of an endogenous meiotic drive gene on Ae. aegypti population dynamics, we established three experimental population types that were initiated with 100%, 10%, and 1% male mosquitoes carrying a strong meiotic driver (T37 strain) and 100% sensitive females (RED strain), respectively. Among the 100% and 10% populations, early generations were highly male biased, which reflected the effects of the meiotic driver, and remained more than 60% male by the F-15. A genetic marker tightly linked with the meiotic driver on chromosome 1 showed strong selection for the T37 strain-specific allele. Similar but reduced effects of the meiotic driver were also observed in the 1% populations. These results suggest that release of A e. aegypti males carrying a strong meiotic driver into drive sensitive populations can be an effective tool for population replacement, and provide a foundation for additional studies including both experimental populations and simulations by mathematical modeling.

A SYBR Green I based strand-specific, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed. The lower detection and quantitation limits were 20 and 200 copies per reaction, respectively. Amounts of positive and negative strand viral RNA strands were correlated. Numbers of plaque-forming units (PFU) were correlated with DENV-2 RNA copy number in both C6/36 cell cultures and mosquitoes. PFU were consistently lower than RNA copy number by 2-3 log(10). Midgut levels of DENV-2 RNA peaked 8 dpi and fluctuated erratically between 6 and 9 dpi. Copies of DENV-2 RNA varied significantly among infected mosquitoes at each time point. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR is a convenient and reliable method that provides new insights into virus-vector interactions.

TI Temporal dynamics of antagonism and mutualism in a geographically
   variable plant-insect interaction
AB Variation among sites and years in the local ecological outcome of interspecific interactions can generate a geographic mosaic of coevolution, as indicated by recent mathematical models. We evaluated whether local temporal dynamics of ecological outcome in the interaction between the moth Greya politella (Prodoxidae) and its host plant Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) are likely to mitigate or magnify geographic differences in ecological outcome found in earlier studies. The moths are highly host-specific pollinating floral parasites, and the mutualism can be swamped in some populations by the presence of effective co-pollinators. Hence, differing community contexts can shift the outcome of the interaction from mutualism to commensalism or antagonism. During each of four years, we evaluated the effect of Greya oviposition on seed development through a paired design that controlled for plant genotype and microenvironment. At Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge in Washington State, the interaction was significantly mutualistic in all four years. Mutualism in this population was indicated by a higher probability of development of capsules visited by ovipositing Greya than capsules not visited by Greya on the same plant. At Rapid River, Idaho, the interaction was commensalistic in three years and antagonistic in one year. Antagonism in this population was indicated by selective withering of capsules containing Greya eggs. Overall, the results suggest stable geographic differences in the range of ecological outcomes in this plant-insect interaction under different community contexts.

TI Vaccination, within-host dynamics, and virulence evolution
AB We explore the potential consequences of vaccination on parasite epidemiology and evolution. Our model combines a microscopic (within-host dynamics) and a macroscopic (epidemiological dynamics) description of the interaction between the parasite and its host. This approach allows relevant epidemiological traits such as parasite transmission, parasite virulence, and host recovery to emerge from a mechanistic model of acute infection describing the interaction between the parasite and the host immune system. We model the effect of a vaccine as an activator of immunity enhancing the replication rate of lymphocytes, their initial density at infection's initiation, their efficacy to kill the parasite, or their activation delay after infection. We analyze the evolution of the replication rate of parasites and show that vaccination may promote the evolution of faster replicating and, consequently, more virulent strains. We also show that intermediate vaccination coverage may lead to the coexistence of two different parasite strategies (a low-virulence strain adapted to naive hosts, and a high-virulence strain, more generalist, adapted to both naive and vaccinated hosts). We discuss the consequences of various vaccination strategies under different epidemiological situations using several distinct measures to evaluate the cost induced by the parasite on individuals and entire host populations.

TI Parasite local adaptation in a geographic mosaic
AB A central prediction of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is that coevolving interspecific interactions will show varying degrees of local maladaptation. According to the theory, much of this local maladaptation is driven by selection mosaics and spatially intermingled coevolutionary hot and cold spots, rather than a simple balance between gene flow and selection. Here I develop a genetic model of host-parasite coevolution that is sufficiently general to incorporate selection mosaics, coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and a diverse array of genetic systems of infection/resistance. Results from this model show that the selection mosaics experienced by the interacting species are an important determinant of the sign and magnitude of local maladaptation. In some cases, this effect may be stronger than a previously described effect of relative rates of parasite and host gene flow. These results provide the first theoretical evidence that selection mosaics and coevolutionary hot and cold spots per se determine the magnitude and sign of local maladaptation. At the same time, however, these results demonstrate that coevolution in a geographic mosaic can lead to virtually any pattern of local adaptation or local maladaptation. Consequently, empirical studies that describe only patterns of local adaptation or maladaptation do not provide evidence either for or against the theory.

TI Parasite-host specificity: Experimental studies on the basis of parasite
   adaptation
AB Specificity in parasitic interactions can be defined by host genotypes that are resistant to only a subset of parasite genotypes and parasite genotypes that are infective on a subset of host genotypes. It is not always clear if specificity is determined by the genotypes of the interactors, or if phenotypic plasticity (sometimes called acclimation) plays a larger role. Coevolutionary outcomes critically depend on the pervasiveness of genetic interactions. We studied specificity using the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa and its crustacean host Daphnia magna. First, we tested for short-term adaptation of P. ramosa lines that had been rapidly shifted among different host genotypes. Adaptation at this time-scale would demonstrate the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to specificity. We found that infectivity was stable across lines irrespective of recent passage history, indicating that in the short term infection outcomes are fixed by genetic backgrounds. Second, we studied longer-term evolution with two host clones and two parasite lines. In this experiment, P. ramosa lines had the possibility to evolve adaptations to the host genotype (clone) in which they were serially passaged, which allowed us to test for a genetic component to specificity. Substantial differences arose in the two passaged lines: one parasite line gained infectivity on the host clone it was grown on, but it lost infectivity on the other host genotype (this line evolved specificity), while the other parasite line evolved higher infectivity on both host clones. We crossed the two host genotypes used in the serial passage experiment and found evidence that the number of host genes that underlies resistance variation is small. In sum, our results show that P. ramosa specificity is a stably inherited trait, it can evolve rapidly, and it is controlled by few genes in the host. These findings are consistent with the idea of a rapid, ongoing arms race between the bacterium and its host.

TI Influence of antibiotic treatment and Wolbachia curing on sexual
   isolation among Drosophila melanogaster cage populations
AB Speciation depends on the establishment of reproductive isolation between populations of the same species, Whether assortative mating evolves as a by-product of adaptation is a major question relevant to the origin of species by reproductive isolation. The long-term selection populations used here were originally established 30 years ago from a single cage population (originating from a maternal one) and subsequently subjected to divergent selection for tolerance of toxins in food (heavy metals versus ethanol) to investigate this question. Those populations now differ in sexual isolation and Wolbachia infection status. Wolbachia are common and widespread bacteria infecting arthropods and nematodes. Attention has recently focused on their potential role in insect speciation, due to post-mating sperm-egg incompatibilities induced by the bacteria. In this paper we examine the potential effect of Wolbachia on the level of sexual isolation. By antibiotic curing, we show that removal of Wolbachia decreases levels of mate discrimination (sexual isolation index) between populations by about 50%. Backcrossing experiments confirm that this effect is due to infection status rather than to genetic changes in the populations resulting from antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment has no effect on mate discrimination level between uninfected populations. Our findings suggest that the presence of Wolbachia (or another undetected bacterial associate) act as an additive factor contributing to the level of pre-mating isolation between these Drosophila melanogaster populations. Given the ubiquity of bacterial associates of insects, such effects could be relevant to some speciation events.

TI Sexually transmitted disease epidemics in a natural insect population
AB 1. The epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in human and domesticated populations is well documented. However, there has been less study of STDs in natural populations.
   2. We investigated STD dynamics in the model system involving a host from the most speciose group of animals: the insects. We investigated temporal variation in the prevalence of the sexually transmitted mite Coccipolipus hippodamiae on its ladybird host, Adalia bipunctata.
   3. Field surveys over two seasons showed a repeated pattern of a profound epidemic in the overwintered cohort and a later prevalence decline.
   4. In order to understand the key factors in the dynamics of this system we studied the phenology of the host and simulated parasite dynamics in the overwintered cohort using a model with within-sex homogeneity in mating rate and field-measured parameter values. The similarity of natural and simulation prevalence levels allowed us to carry out sensitivity analysis and hence to identify the key determinants of the dynamics.
   5. The observed pattern of periodic extreme prevalence combined with system persistence probably results from time lags in host recruitment and widespread promiscuity.
   6. Our findings improve our understanding of STDs in natural populations and illustrate the importance of examining seasonality and time delays in population dynamics in order to fully understand the characteristics of natural populations and their parasites.

TI Parasitism shaping host life-history evolution: adaptive responses in a
   marine gastropod to infection by trematodes
AB 1. Variation in life-history strategies among conspecific populations indicates the action of local selective pressures; recently, parasitism has been suggested as one of these local forces.
   2. Effects of trematode infections on reproductive effort, juvenile growth, size at maturity and susceptibility were investigated among different natural populations of the marine gastropod Zeacumantus subcarinatus, Sowerby 1855.
   3. Reproductive effort was not higher in uninfected snails from populations experiencing a high trematode prevalence, but females from high prevalence populations produced significantly larger offspring compared with their conspecifics from other populations.
   4. Juvenile growth rate was significantly higher in laboratory-raised snails originating from females in a high prevalence population compared with other populations.
   5 Size at maturity, determined by the appearance of functional gonads, was significantly and negatively related to trematode prevalence, and positively related to mean snail size, across 10 populations in the study area.
   6. There was no evidence of different host resistance against trematodes in sentinel snails from high and low prevalence populations exposed to the same infection pressure in the field.
   7. Our results strongly indicate that Z. subcarinatus adapt to trematodes by reaching maturity early, thereby maximizing their chance of reproducing in populations experiencing a high prevalence of infection by castrating trematodes.

TI Host ploidy, parasitism and immune defence in a coevolutionary
   snail-trematode system
AB We studied the role of host ploidy and parasite exposure on immune defence allocation in a snail-trematode system (Potamopyrgus antipodarum-Microphallus sp.). In the field, haemocyte (the defence cell) concentration was lowest in deep-water habitats where infection is relatively low and highest in shallow-water habitats where infection is common. Because the frequency of asexual triploid snails is positively correlated with depth, we also experimentally studied the role of ploidy by exposing both diploid sexual and triploid asexual snails to Microphallus eggs. We found that triploid snails had lower haemocyte concentrations than did diploids in both parasite-addition and parasite-free treatments. We also found that both triploids and diploids increased their numbers of large granular haemocytes at similar rates after parasite exposure. Because triploid P. antipodarum have been shown to be more resistant to allopatric parasites than diploids, the current results suggest that the increased resistance of triploids is because of intrinsic genetic properties rather than to greater allocation to defence cells. This finding is consistent with recent theory on the advantages of increased ploidy for hosts combating coevolving parasites.

TI Does genetic diversity hinder parasite evolution in social insect
   colonies?
AB Polyandry is often difficult to explain because benefits of the behaviour have proved elusive. In social insects, polyandry increases the genetic diversity of workers within a colony and this has been suggested to improve the resistance of the colony to disease. Here we examine the possible impact of host genetic diversity on parasite evolution by carrying out serial passages of a virulent fungal pathogen through leaf-cutting ant workers of known genotypes. Parasite virulence increased over the nine-generation span of the experiment while spore production decreased. The effect of host relatedness upon virulence appeared limited. However, parasites cycled through more genetically diverse hosts were more likely to go extinct during the experiment and parasites cycled through more genetically similar hosts had greater spore production. These results indicate that host genetic diversity may indeed hinder the ability of parasites to adapt while cycling within social insect colonies.

TI Can maternally transmitted endosymbionts facilitate the evolution of
   haplodiploidy?
AB Whilst many invertebrate taxa are haplodiploid, the factors underlying the evolution of haplodiploidy remain unresolved. We investigate theoretically whether haplodiploidy might evolve as an outcome of the co-evolution between maternally inherited endosymbionts and their hosts. First, we substantially extend a recently developed model that involves maternally inherited endosymbionts that kill male offspring by eliminating the paternal genome. We also put forward a new hypothesis and develop a model that involves bacteria that induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Based on these models, we explore the co-evolutionary events that might occur between hosts and symbionts. We find that both with male-killers and CI-inducing endosymbionts, the hosts are likely to develop increased viability of haploid males, which can be considered a preadaptation to haplodiploidy. In addition, populations with haploidizing male-killers can in some cases evolve directly towards a genetic system of paternal genome elimination, a special form of haplodiploidy. These results are combined with consideration of mechanism and ecology to appraise the likelihood of male-killers and CI inducing bacteria being involved in the evolution of haplodiploidy.

TI Host resistance and parasite virulence in greenfinch coccidiosis
AB The question why different host individuals within a population differ with respect to infection resistance is of fundamental importance for understanding the mechanisms of parasite-mediated selection. We addressed this question by infecting wild-caught captive male greenfinches with intestinal coccidian parasites originating either from single or multiple hosts. Birds with naturally low pre-experimental infection retained their low infection status also after reinfection with multiple strains, indicating that natural infection intensities confer information about the phenotypic ability of individuals to resist novel strains. Exposure to novel strains did not result in protective immunity against the subsequent infection with the same strains. Infection with multiple strains resulted in greater virulence than single-strain infection, indicating that parasites originating from different host individuals are genetically diverse. Our experiment thus demonstrates the validity of important but rarely tested assumptions of many models of parasite-mediated selection in a wild bird species and its common parasite.

TI Effect of HIV-1 infection on antimalarial treatment outcomes in Uganda:
   A population-based study
AB Background. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may increase the burden of malaria by increasing susceptibility to infection or by decreasing the response to antimalarial treatment. We investigated the seroprevalence rate of HIV-1 infection and its effect on antimalarial treatment outcomes in adults and children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Uganda.
   Methods. This retrospective study included 1965 patients >= 18 months old who were randomized to receive 1 of 3 antimalarial regimens at 7 sites in Uganda. HIV-1 testing was performed using 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays andWestern blot analysis of stored blood spots. The primary study outcome was clinical treatment failure at 28 days after antimalarial treatment. Molecular genotyping was used to distinguish clinical treatment failures due to new infections from those due to recrudescences.
   Results. The HIV-1 seroprevalence rate was 2.5% in 1802 patients < 18 years old and 31% in 163 patients >= 18 years old presenting with malaria. HIV-1 infection was associated with a > 3-fold (hazard ratio [HR], 3.28 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.25-8.59]) increased risk of clinical treatment failure for adults, but there was no increased risk for HIV-1-infected children. Molecular genotyping revealed that clinical treatment failures were due to new infections (HR, 6.35 [ 95% CI, 1.64-24.5]) rather than to recrudescences (HR, 1.51 [95% CI, 0.27-8.58]).
   Conclusions. The HIV-1 seroprevalence rate was surprisingly high in adults presenting with malaria. This finding supports the implementation of routine HIV counseling and testing for adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. HIV-1 infection increased the susceptibility to new malarial infections but did not increase the risk of recrudescences in adults.

During the past 6 years, a theoretical framework based on mathematical models has emerged that provides solid and testable hypotheses and opens the road to a quantitative assessment of the main obstructions that undermine current efforts to control the spread of health-care-associated infections in hospitals and communities. We aim to explain to a broader audience of professionals in health care, infection control, and health systems administration some of these models that can improve the understanding of the hidden dynamics of health-care-associated infections. We also appraise their usefulness and limitations as an innovative research and decision tool for control purposes.

TI Antagonistic coevolution with parasites increases the cost of host
   deleterious mutations
AB The fitness consequences of deleterious mutations are sometimes greater when individuals are parasitized, hence parasites may result in the more rapid purging of deleterious mutations from host populations. The significance of host deleterious mutations when hosts and parasites antagonistically coevolve (reciprocal evolution of host resistance and parasite infectivity) has not previously been experimentally investigated. We addressed this by coevolving the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and a parasitic bacteriophage in laboratory microcosms, using bacteria with high and low mutation loads. Directional coevolution between bacterial resistance and phage infectivity occurred in all populations. Bacterial population fitness, as measured by competition experiments with ancestral genotypes in the absence of phage, declined with time spent coevolving. However, this decline was significantly more rapid in bacteria with high mutation loads, suggesting the cost of bacterial resistance to phage was greater in the presence of deleterious mutations (synergistic epistasis). As such, resistance to phage was more costly to evolve in the presence of a high mutation load. Consistent with these data, bacteria with high mutation loads underwent less rapid directional coevolution with their phage populations, and showed lower levels of resistance to their coevolving phage populations. These data suggest that coevolution with parasites increases the rate at which deleterious mutations are purged from host populations.

TI Apparent seasonality of parasite dynamics: analysis of cyclic prevalence
   patterns
AB Seasonal disease dynamics are common in nature, but their causes are often unknown. Our case study provides insight into the cyclic prevalence pattern of the horizontally and vertically transmitted microsporidium Octosporea bayeri in its Daphnia magna host. Data from several populations over a four year period revealed a regular prevalence increase during summer and a decrease over winter when hosts underwent diapause. Prevalence also decreased after summer diapause indicating that the decline is causally linked to diapause rather than to winter conditions. Experiments showed that host diapause itself can explain a certain proportion of the decline. The decline further depends on the environmental conditions during diapause: infected resting eggs suffered from higher mortality under experimental winter than under experimental summer diapause conditions. Investigating the mechanisms of prevalence increase after diapause, the parasite was found to survive winter outside its host, enabling horizontal infection of susceptible hosts in the following growing season. Allowing for horizontal transmission in experimental host populations resulted in a steep prevalence increase, while excluding it led to a pronounced decline. Thus, the apparent seasonality in O. bayeri prevalence is characterized by a decline during host diapause followed by horizontal spread of the parasite during the host's asexual growth phase.

   commercial sex workers in Argentina
AB Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have shown to enhance the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to be more common among female commercial sex workers (FSWs). A cross-sectional Study was conducted among 625 FSWs in six cities of Argentina in 2000-2002. The scroprevalence of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I/II, and syphilis was 3.2%, 14.4%, 4.3%, 1.6%, and 45.7%, respectively. Syphilis was associated with older age (>= 30),cars, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.6 to 4.9), >= 10 years in sex work (AOR = 2.2), use of illegal drugs (AOR 2.1), and a prior history of an STI (AOR 3.0). HBV and syphilis was the most common co-infection in 44 (7.5%) subjects. FSWs in Argentina are exposed to HIV and other STIs due to high-risk sexual and illegal drug use behavior. Renewed efforts are necessary to intervene effectively in this high-risk Population.

   house mosquito
AB The southern house mosquito Cidex quinquefasciatus is a principal vector of human lymphatic filariasis, several encephalitides (including West Nile virus), avian malaria, and poxvirus, but its importance as it vector varies considerably among regions. This species has spread with humans and is ubiquitous in tropical urban and suburban environments. This was the first mosquito to reach Hawaii and we performed a worldwide genetic survey using microsatellite loci to identify its source. Our analyses showed divergent Old World and New World genetic signatures in Cx. quinquefasciatus with further distinctions between cast and west African, Asian, and Pacific populations that correlate with the epidemiology of human filariasis. We found that in Hawaii south Pacific mosquitoes have largely replaced the original New World introduction of Cx. quinquefasciatus, consistent with their reported expansion to higher elevations. We hypothesize worldwide pathways of expansion of this disease vector.

TI Evolutionary feedback mediated through population density, illustrated
   with viruses in chemostats
AB A cornerstone of evolutionary ecology is that population density affects adaptation: r and K selection is the obvious example. The reverse is also appreciated: adaptation impacts population density. Yet, empirically demonstrating a direct connection between population density and adaptation is challenging. Here, we address both evolution and ecology of population density in models of viral (bacteriophage) chemostats. Chemostats supply nutrients for host cell growth, and the hosts are prey for viral reproduction. Two different chemostat designs have profoundly different consequences for viral evolution. If host and virus are confined to the same chamber, as in a predator-prey system, viral regulation of hosts feeds back to maintain low viral density (measured as infections per cell). Viral adaptation impacts host density but has a small effect on equilibrium viral density. More interesting are chemostats that supply the viral population with hosts from a virus-free refuge. Here, a type of evolutionary succession operates: adaptation at low viral density leads to higher density, but high density then favors competitive ability. Experiments support these models with both phenotypic and molecular data. Parallels to these designs exist in many natural systems, so these experimental systems may yield insights to the evolution and regulation of natural populations.

   during a population outbreak
AB During population outbreaks, top-down and bottom-up factors are unable to control defoliator numbers. To our knowledge, details of biotic interactions leading to increased population density have not been Studied during real Population outbreaks. We c experimentally assessed the strength of plant defenses and of insect immunocompetence, assumed to contribute to active insect resistance against parasitoids and pathogens, in the geometrid Epirrita autumnata during a steep increase in population density. We demonstrated rapid (same-season) induced resistance in the foliage of its host, mountain birch. The response was systemic, spreading throughout the tree, and retarded larval growth rate by similar to 10%. On the other hand, no direct delayed carry-over effects were found in the next season in larval growth rate, mortality, or pupal mass. Larval damage to a tree during the previous year, however, significantly (by similar to 13%) accelerated the advance of the immune response (measured as melanization of,in implant inserted into the pupal hemocoel). The encapsulation rate correlated positively with larval mortality in trees in which larvae had been introduced the previous year, but not in control trees. Both of these observations suggest that induced plant defense was associated with ail increased insect immunocompetence during the Population increase.

TI Contact rates and exposure to inter-species disease transmission in
   mountain ungulates
AB The risk for a pathogen to cross the species barrier depends on the rate of efficient contacts between the species. However, contact rates between species have rarely been estimated from observations. Here we estimate contact rates and exposure of chamois Rupicapra rupicapra and Alpine ibex Capra ibex exposed to domestic pasteurellosis and brucellosis carried by sheep or cattle herds summering in mountain pastures. We use field observation data on animal positions treated in a geographic information system (GIS). Comparing 10 pastures, we show that the management of domestic herds influences the risk of inter-species transmission. Exposure to direct transmission of pasteurellosis is high when herds are not guarded nor enclosed, whereas exposure to indirect transmission of brucellosis is increased on epidemiological dangerous points such as salt deposits. Our preliminary results need further investigation, but they underline the importance of both herd management and pathogen transmission mode when the aim is to reduce the risk of contamination of wild populations by a pathogen associated with domestic pathogens.

   recreational waterpark
AB Cryptosporidium has become increasingly recognized as a pathogen responsible for outbreaks of diarrhoeal illness in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons. In August 2001, an Illinois hospital reported a cryptosporidiosis cluster potentially linked to a local waterpark. There were 358 case-patients identified. We conducted community-based and waterpark-based case-control studies to examine potential sources of the outbreak. We collected stool specimens from ill persons and pool water samples for microscopy and molecular analysis. Laboratory-confirmed case-patients (n = 77) were more likely to have attended the waterpark [odds ratio (OR) 16.0, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.8-66.8], had pool water in the mouth (OR 6.0, 95 % CI 1.3-26.8), and swallowed pool water (OR 4.5, 95 % CI 1.5-13.3) than age-matched controls. Cryptosporidium was found in stool specimens and pool water samples. The chlorine resistance of oocysts, frequent swimming exposures, high bather densities, heavy usage by diaper-aged children, and increased recognition and reporting of outbreaks are likely to have contributed to the increasing trend in number of swimming pool-associated outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis. Recommendations for disease prevention include alteration of pool design to separate toddler pool filtration systems from other pools. Implementation of education programmes could reduce the risk of faecal contamination and disease transmission.

TI High Wolbachia density correlates with cost of infection for insecticide
   resistant Culex pipiens mosquitoes
AB In the mosquito Culex pipiens, insecticide resistance genes alter many life-history traits and incur a fitness cost. Resistance to organophosphate insecticides involves two loci, with each locus coding for a different mechanism of resistance (degradation vs. insensitivity to insecticides). The density of intracellular Wolbachia bacteria has been found to be higher in resistant mosquitoes, regardless of the mechanism involved. To discriminate between costs of resistance due to resistance genes from those associated with elevated Wolbachia densities, we compared strains of mosquito sharing the same genetic background but differing in their resistance alleles and Wolbachia infection status. Life-history traits measured included strength of insecticide resistance, larval mortality, adult female size, fecundity, predation avoidance, mating competition, and strength of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). We found that: (1) when, Wolbachia are removed, insecticide resistance genes still affect some life-history traits; (2) Wolbachia are capable of modifying the cost of resistance; (3) the cost of Wolbachia infections increases with their density; (4) different interactions occurred depending on the resistance alleles involved; and (5) high densities of Wolbachia do not increase the strength of Cl or maternal transmission efficiency relative to low Wolbachia densities. Insecticide resistance genes generated variation in the costs of Wolbachia infections and provided an interesting opportunity to study how these costs evolve, a process generally operating when Wolbachia colonizes a new host.

AB Malaria parasites are a major cause of human mortality in tropical countries and a potential threat for wildlife, as witnessed by the malaria-induced extinction of naive Hawaiian avifauna. Identifying resistance mechanisms is therefore crucial both for human health and wildlife conservation. Patterns of malaria resistance are known to be highly polygenic in both humans and mice, with marked contributions attributed to major histocompatibility (Mhc) genes. Here we show that specific Mhc variants are linked to both increased resistance and susceptibility to malaria infection in a wild passerine species, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). In addition, links between host immunogenctics and resistance to malaria involved population-specific alleles, suggesting local adaptation in this host-parasite interaction. This is the first evidence for a population-specific genetic control of resistance to malaria in a wild species.

TI Do standard measures of immunocompetence reflect parasite resistance?
   The case of Greenfinch coccidiosis
AB 1. Much research in evolutionary animal ecology is currently focused on issues related to parasite-mediated selection. Because of difficulties in estimation of actual parasite resistance, researchers often rely on surrogate measures of immunocompetence, such as the magnitude of immune responses to artificial antigens, assuming that these measures correlate with individuals' ability to resist disease.
   2. This assumption was tested in the Greenfinch (Carduelis chloris L.) coccidiosis model by measuring the association between parasite resistance and two standard assays of immune function - a swelling response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and antibody production against sheep red blood cells (SRBC).
   3. Before performing immune challenge assays, host resistance to the intestinal parasite Isospora lacazei (Labbe) was assessed on the basis of individual infection intensities and responses to challenge infection with alien parasite strains.
   4. Increases in infection intensities after inoculation of birds with novel parasite strains correlated positively with magnitude of swelling response to PHA injection. Thus, intense parasite multiplication in the host's digestive tract resulted in the enhancement of the host's cell-mediated immune function.
   5. Among birds that were vulnerable to novel infections, no correlations emerged between infection intensities, SRBC antibody titres and condition indices.
   6. Among non-vulnerable hosts (whose infection intensities did not increase after experimental reinfection), SRBC antibody titres correlated negatively with infection intensities and positively with indices of nutritional condition. Hence, high SRBC antibody titres reflected good nutritional status and superior resistance to an important parasite species in a subsample of studied Greenfinches.
   7. Altogether, our results exemplify the diversity of outcomes when the host's immune system is simultaneously challenged by natural enemies and artificial antigens, and call for the cautious interpretation of the results of standard immune tests in the context of parasite resistance.

TI Role of T cells in innate and adaptive immunity against murine
   Burkholderia pseudomallei infection
AB Antigen-specific T cells are important sources of interferon (IFN)-gamma for acquired immunity to intracellular pathogens, but they can also produce IFN-gamma directly via a "bystander" activation pathway in response to proinflammatory cytokines. We investigated the in vivo role of cytokine- versus antigen-mediated T cell activation in resistance to the pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-18 were essential for initial bacterial control in infected mice. B. pseudomallei infection rapidly generated a potent IFN-gamma response from natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, conventional T cells, and other cell types within 16 h after infection, in an IL-12- and IL-18-dependent manner. However, early T cell- and NK cell derived IFN-g responses were functionally redundant in cell depletion studies, with IFN-g produced by other cell types, such as major histocompatibility complex class IIint F4/80(+) macrophages being sufficient for initial resistance. In contrast, B. pseudomallei-specific CD4(+) T cells played an important role during the later stage of infection. Thus, the T cell response to primary B. pseudomallei infection is biphasic, an early cytokine-induced phase in which T cells appear to be functionally redundant for initial bacterial clearance, followed by a later antigen-induced phase in which B. pseudomallei-specific T cells, in particular CD4(+) T cells, are important for host resistance.

   population: A nested case-control study
AB Background. Risk factors influencing the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were investigated in a case-control study nested within a community-randomized trial of treatment of syndromic sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in rural Tanzania.
   Methods. Case patients were persons who became HIV positive, and control subjects were randomly selected from among persons who remained HIV negative. For each sex, we obtained adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for biomedical and behavioral factors.
   Results. We analyzed 92 case patients and 903 control subjects. In both sexes, the incidence of HIV infection was significantly higher in subjects with an HIV-positive spouse than in those with HIV-negative spouse ( men: OR, 25.1; women: OR, 34.0). The incidence of HIV infection was significantly higher in those who became positive for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) ( men: OR, 5.60; women: OR, 4.76) and those who were HSV-2-positive at baseline ( men: OR, 3.66; women: OR, 2.88) than in subjects who were HSV-2 negative. In women, living elsewhere ( OR, 3.22) and never having given birth ( OR, 4.27) were significant risk factors. After adjustment, the incidence of HIV infection was not significantly associated with a history of injections or STIs in either sex.
   Conclusion. HSV-2 infection was the most important risk factor for HIV infection, which highlights the need for HSV-2 interventions in HIV infection control, and there were particularly strong associations with recent HSV-2 seroconversion. The PAF associated with having an HIV-positive spouse was low, but this is likely to increase during the epidemic.

Intermittent preventive treatment, usually with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, has been shown to prevent pregnancy-related malaria and its complications. Several different regimens of antiretroviral therapy are now available to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV and/or progression of maternal HIV infection during pregnancy. However, no published studies have yet shown whether standard intermittent preventive treatment and antiretroviral regimens are medically and operationally compatible in pregnancy. We reviewed existing policies regarding prevention and treatment of HIV and malaria in pregnancy, as well as published literature on adverse effects of antiretrovirals and antimalarials commonly used in pregnancy in developing countries, and found that concurrent prescription of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and antiretroviral agents including nevirapine and zidovudine per existing protocols for prevention of malaria and vertical HIV transmission may result in adverse drug interactions or overlapping, diagnostically challenging drug toxicities. Insecticide-treated bednets should be provided for HIV-infected pregnant women at risk for malaria. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine should be prescribed cautiously in women concurrently receiving daily nevirapine and/or zidovudine, and should be avoided in women on daily co-trimoxazole. Further research is urgently needed to define safe and effective protocols for concurrent management of HIV and malaria in pregnancy, and to define appropriate interventions for different populations subject to differing levels of malaria transmission and antimalarial drug resistance.

TI Evolution of host resistance: looking for coevolutionary hotspots at
   small spatial scales
AB Natural plant populations are often found to be extremely diverse in their resistance to pathogens. While the potential of pathogens in driving the evolution of resistance in hosts has been widely recognized, empirical evidence linking disease dynamics to host population genetic structure has remained scarce. Here I show that current coevolutionary selection for resistance can be divergent even on a very fine spatial scale. In a natural plant-pathogen metapopulation, disease occurrence patterns were highly aggregated over space and time within host populations. A laboratory inoculation experiment showed higher resistance within areas of the host populations where encounter rates with the pathogen have been high. Higher resistance to sympatric than to allopatric strains of the pathogen suggests that this change has taken place as a response to local selection. These results constitute evidence of adaptive microevolution of resistance resulting from disease epidemics in natural plant-pathogen associations, and highlight the importance of finding the relevant scale at which to address questions of current coevolutionary selection.

TI Bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) in British farmland wildlife:
   the importance to agriculture
AB Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an important disease of cattle and an emerging infectious disease of humans. Cow- and badger-based control strategies have failed to eradicate bTB from the British cattle herd, and the incidence is rising by about 18% per year. The annual cost to taxpayers in Britain is currently k74 million. Research has focused on the badger as a potential bTB reservoir, with little attention being paid to other mammals common on farmland. We have conducted a systematic survey of wild mammals (n=4393 individuals) present on dairy farms to explore the role of species other than badgers in the epidemiology of bTB. Cultures were prepared from 10 397 samples (primarily faeces, urine and tracheal aspirates). One of the 1307 bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) live-sampled, and three of the 43 badgers (Meles meles), yielded positive isolates of Mycobacterium bovis. This is the first time the bacterium has been isolated from the bank vole. The strain type was the same as that found in cattle and badgers on the same farm. However, our work indicates that the mean prevalence of infectious individuals among common farmland wildlife is extremely low (the upper 95% confidence interval is <= 2.0 for all of the abundant species). Mathematical models illustrate that it is highly unlikely the disease could be maintained at such low levels. Our results suggest that these animals are relatively unimportant as reservoirs of bTB, having insufficient within-species (or within-group) transmission to sustain the infection, though occasional spill-overs from cattle or badgers may occur.

TI Patterns of influenza-associated mortality among US elderly by
   geographic region and virus subtype, 1968-1998
AB The regular seasonality of influenza in temperate countries is recognized, but regional differences in patterns of influenza-related mortality are poorly understood. Identifying patterns could improve epidemic prediction and prevention. The authors analyzed the monthly percentage of deaths attributable to pneumonia and influenza among people aged 65 or more years in the contiguous United States, 1968-1998. The local Moran's I test for spatial autocorrelation and correlograms assessing space-time synchrony within each influenza season were applied to detect and to characterize mortality patterns. Western US regions experienced epidemics of greater magnitude than did eastern regions. Positive spatial autocorrelation (two-sided p = 0.001) revealed the similarity in influenza mortality of neighboring states, with several western states forming a focus of high mortality. In transmission seasons dominated by virus subtype A(H3N2), mortality was correlated at a high and consistent level across the United States (mean correlation = 0.56, standard deviation = 0.134). However, when subtype A(H1N1) or type B dominated, the average synchrony was lower (mean correlation = 0.23, standard deviation = 0.058). These novel analyses suggest that causes of spatial heterogeneity (e.g., large-scale environmental drivers and population movement) have impacted influenza-associated mortality.

TI The interferon antagonist NS2 protein of respiratory syncytial virus is
   an important virulence determinant for humans
AB Background. Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV) is targeted for vaccine development, because it causes severe respiratory tract illness in the elderly, young children, and infants. A primary strategy has been to derive live attenuated viruses for use in intranasally administered vaccines that will induce a protective immune response. In the present study, the NS2 gene, whose encoded protein antagonizes the host's interferon-alpha/beta response, was deleted from RSV vaccine candidates by use of reverse genetics.
   Methods. Three NS2 gene - deleted RSV vaccine candidates were studied: rA2cp Delta NS2, rA2cp248/ 404 Delta NS2, and rA2cp530/ 1009 Delta NS2. rA2cp Delta NS2, which had the fewest attenuating mutations, was evaluated in adults and RSV-seropositive children. rA2cp248/ 404DNS2 and rA2cp530/ 1009DNS2 were evaluated in adults and RSV- seropositive and RSV- seronegative children.
   Results. At a high dose ( 10(7.0) pfu), rA2cp Delta NS2 was not shed by adults, and only 13% of them had an immune response. The other vaccine candidates, rA2cp248/ 404 Delta NS2 and rA2cp530/ 1009 Delta NS2, had greatly decreased infectivity in RSV- seronegative children, compared with that of their immediate parent strains, which possess an intact NS2 gene.
   Conclusions. Deletion of the NS2 gene attenuates RSV in subjects of all ages studied. This validates the strategy of developing live respiratory tract virus vaccines in which the virus's ability to inhibit the human innate immune system is blocked. rA2cp248/ 404 Delta NS2 should be studied in children at a higher input titer, because it was more infectious and immunogenic than was rA2cp530/ 1009 Delta NS2.

TI Integrating life history and cross-immunity into the evolutionary
   dynamics of pathogens
AB Models for the diversity and evolution of pathogens have branched into two main directions: the adaptive dynamics of quantitative life-history traits (notably virulence) and the maintenance and invasion of multiple, antigenically diverse strains that interact with the host's immune memory. In a first attempt to reconcile these two approaches, we developed a simple modelling framework where two strains of pathogens, defined by a pair of life-history traits (infectious period and infectivity), interfere through a given level of cross-immunity. We used whooping cough as a potential example, but the framework proposed here could be applied to other acute infectious diseases. Specifically, we analysed the effects of these parameters on the invasion dynamics of one strain into a population, where the second strain is endemic. Whereas the deterministic version of the model converges towards stable coexistence of the two strains in most cases, stochastic simulations showed that transient epidemic dynamics can cause the extinction of either strain. Thus ecological dynamics, modulated by the immune parameters, eventually determine the adaptive value of different pathogen genotypes. We advocate an integrative view of pathogen dynamics at the crossroads of immunology, epidemiology and evolution, as a way towards efficient control of infectious diseases.

TI Hypervariable prophage WO sequences describe an unexpected high number
   of Wolbachia variants in the mosquito Culex pipiens
AB Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria that infect many arthropod species and may induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) resulting in abortive embryonic development. Among all the described host species, mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex display the highest variability of CI crossing types. Paradoxically, searches for polymorphism in Wolbachia infecting strains and field populations hitherto failed or produced very few markers. Here, we show that an abundant source of the long-sought polymorphism lies in WO prophage sequences present in multiple copies dispersed in the genome of Wolbachia infecting C. pipiens (omega Pip). We identified up to 66 different Wolbachia variants in C. pipiens strains and field populations and no occurrence of superinfection was observed. At least 49 different Wolbachia occurred in Southern Europe C. pipiens populations, and up to 10 different Wolbachia were even detected in a single population. This is in sharp contrast with North African and Cretan samples, which exhibited only six variants. The WO polymorphism appeared stable over time, and was exclusively transferred maternally. Interestingly, we found that the CI pattern previously described correlates with the variability of Gp 15, a prophage protein similar to a bacterial virulence protein. WO prophage sequences thus represent variable markers that now open routes for approaching the molecular basis of CI, the host effects, the structure and dynamics of Wolbachia populations.

TI Viral ecology and the maintenance of novel host use
AB Viruses can occasionally emerge by infecting new host species. However, the early phases of emergence can hinge upon ecological sustainability of the virus population, which is a product of both within- host population growth and between- host transmission. Insufficient growth or transmission can force virus extinction before the latter phases of emergence, where genetic adaptations that improve host use may occur. We examined the early phase of emergence by studying the population dynamics of RNA phages in replicated laboratory environments containing native and novel host bacteria. To predict the breadth of transmission rates allowing viral persistence on each species, we developed a simple model based on in vitro data for phage growth rate over a range of initial population densities on both hosts. Validation of these predictions using serial passage experiments revealed a range of transmission rates for which the native host was a source and the novel host was a sink. In this critical range of transmission rates, periodic exposure to the native host was sufficient for the maintenance of the viral population on the novel host. We argue that this effect should facilitate adaptation by the virus to utilize the novel host - often crucial in subsequent phases of emergence.

TI Experimental exposures of boreal toads (Bufo boreas) to a pathogenic
   chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis)
AB One of the major causes of worldwide amphibian declines is a skin infection caused by a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). This study documents the interactions between this pathogen and a susceptible amphibian host, the boreal toad (Bufo boreas). The amount of time following exposure until death is influenced by the dosage of infectious zoospores, duration of exposure, and body size of the toad. The significant relation between dosage and the number of days survived (dose-response curve) supports the hypothesis that the degree of infection must reach a particular threshold of about 10(7)-10(8) zoosporangia before death results. Variation in air temperature between 12 degrees C and 23 degrees C had no significant effect on survival time. The infection can be transmitted from infected to healthy animals by contact with water containing zoospores; no physical contact between animals is required. These results are correlated with observations on the population biology of boreal toads in which mortalities associated with B. dendrobatidis have been identified.

TI Environmental variation mediates the deleterious effects of Coleosporium
   ipomoeae on Ipomoea purpurea
AB Variation in the environment is common within and between natural populations and may influence selection on plant resistance by altering the level of damage or the fitness consequences of damage from plant enemies. While Much is known about how environmental variation influences the amount of damage a plant experiences, few studies have attempted to determine how variation in the environment may alter the fitness consequences of damage, particularly in plant-pathogen interactions. In this work we manipulated a rust pathogen, Coleosporium ipomoeae, in field experiments and showed that this pathogen reduced several components of fitness in its natural host plant, Ipomoea purpurea. Furthermore, we showed that the deleterious effects of C. ipomoeae were variable. We identified variation in the quality of a plant's microenvironment, the abundance of secondary enemy damage, and the length of a growing season as variable components of the environment that may influence the magnitude of damage and tolerance, causing the interaction between C. ipomoeae and L purpurea to vary from parasitism to commensalism. Considering how environmental variation impacts the magnitude and negative fitness effects of pathogen damage is important to understanding spatially variable selection and coevolution in this and other plant-pathogen interactions.

TI A human-health risk assessment for West Nile virus and insecticides used
   in mosquito management
AB West Nile virus (WNV) has been a major public health concern in North America since 1999, when the first outbreak in the Western Hemisphere occurred in New York City. As a result of this ongoing disease outbreak, management of mosquitoes that vector WNV throughout the United States and Canada has necessitated using insecticides in areas where they traditionally have not been used or have been used less frequently. This has resulted in concerns by the public about the risks from insecticide use. The objective of this study was to use reasonable worst-case risk assessment methodologies to evaluate human-health risks for WNV and the insecticides most commonly used to control adult mosquitoes. We evaluated documented health effects from WNV infection and determined potential population risks based on reported frequencies. We determined potential acute (1-day) and subchronic (90-day) multiroute residential exposures from each insecticide for several human subgroups during a WNV disease outbreak scenario. We then compared potential insecticide exposures to toxicologic and regulatory effect levels. Risk quotients (RQs, the ratio of exposure to toxicologic effect) were <1.0 for all subgroups. Acute RQs ranged from 0.0004 to 0.4726, and subchronic RQs ranged from 0.00014 to 0.2074. Results from our risk assessment and the current weight of scientific evidence indicate that human-health risks from residential exposure to mosquito insecticides are low and are not likely to exceed levels of concern. Further, our results indicate that, based on human-health criteria, the risks from WNV exceed the risks from exposure to mosquito insecticides.

TI Minimal selfing, few clones, and no among-host genetic structure in a
   hermaphroditic parasite with asexual larval propagation
AB Little is known about actual mating systems in natural populations of parasites or about what constitutes the limits of a parasite deme. These parameters are interesting because they affect levels of genetic diversity, opportunities for local adaptation, and other evolutionary processes. We expect that transmission dynamics and the distribution of parasites among hosts should have a large effect on mating systems and demic structure, but currently we have mostly speculation and very few data. For example, infrapopulations (all the parasites in a single host) should behave as demes if parasite offspring are transmitted as a clump from host to host over several generations. However, if offspring are well mixed, then the parasite component population (all the parasites among a host population) would function as the deme. Similarly, low mean intensities or a high proportion of worms in single infections should increase the selfing rate. For species having an asexual amplification stage, transmission between intermediate and definitive (final) hosts will control the variance in clonal reproductive success, which in turn could have a large influence on effective sizes and rates of inbreeding. We examined demic structure, selfing rates, and the variance in clonal reproductive success in natural populations of Plagioporus shawi, a hermaphroditic trematode that parasitizes salmon. Overall levels of genetic diversity were very high. An a posteriori inference of population structure overwhelmingly supports the component population as the deme, rather than individual infrapopulations. Only a single pair of 597 adult individuals was identified as clones. Thus, the variance in clonal reproductive success was almost zero. Despite being hermaphroditic, P. shawi appears to be almost entirely outcrossing. Genetic estimates of selfing (< 5%) were in accordance with the proportion of parasites from single infections. Thus, it appears that individual flukes outcross whenever possible and only resort to selfing when alone. Finally, our data support the hypothesis that aquatic transmission and the use of several intermediate hosts promotes high genetic diversity and well-mixed infrapopulations.

TI The distribution of eggs per host in a herbivorous insect - intersection
   of oviposition, dispersal and population dynamics
AB The dynamics of parasitic organisms depend critically upon the frequency distribution of parasite individuals per host. However, the processes giving rise to this frequency distribution have rarely been modelled and tested for organisms with complex host selection behaviour.
   In this study Microrhopala vittata, a chrysomelid beetle, was used to investigate how oviposition behaviour, movement and density of host plants interact in shaping the frequency distribution of egg clusters per host in the field.
   Enclosures were stocked with two different host species and different beetle densities and various stochastic process models were fitted to egg cluster count data obtained from these enclosures. The different models were derived considering different scenarios, in particular whether or not plant density limits oviposition rate, whether or not ovipositing females actively seek out the most attractive plant within their perception radius and whether a female's oviposition rate is determined by plant intrinsic factors, the plant's egg cluster load or the surrounding beetle density.
   The model parameters fitted to cage data were used to describe the frequency distribution of egg cluster counts obtained in a release experiment in the field. A total of 220 beetle pairs were released at five locations in a field where this beetle was not observed previously. Each release point was at a border between the two host species.
   One model predicted for the preferred host species the egg cluster count frequencies in the field from parameters estimated in the cages. This model assumed that egg clusters present on a plant increased subsequent oviposition on this plant. All other models could not describe the distribution of egg cluster counts for either of the two host species.
   The results suggest that females seek out attractive hosts actively and the attractiveness of a plant increases with its egg cluster load. This behaviour creates a frequency distribution of egg clusters per host that depends only on beetle density but not on plant density. This conclusion has important implications for modelling insect-plant interactions.

TI Relationship between host abundance and parasite distribution: inferring
   regulating mechanisms from census data
AB We studied the effect of host abundance on parasite abundance and prevalence using data on 57 associations of fleas (Siphonaptera) and their mammalian hosts from Slovakia.
   We assumed that flea-induced host mortality could be inferred from the relationship between flea aggregation and flea abundance, whereas host-induced flea mortality could be inferred from the relationship between flea abundance or aggregation and host abundance.
   Relationships between flea abundance or prevalence and host abundance were either negative (in 23 flea-host associations) or absent (in 34 flea-host associations). Negative relationships between flea abundance and host abundance were always accompanied by negative relationships between flea prevalence and host abundance.
   The link between flea abundance/prevalence and host abundance was evaluated as the coefficient of determination of the respective regressions. Across flea-host associations, this link decreased with an increase in the degree of flea aggregation (measured as a parameter b of Taylor's power law).
   Mean crowding of fleas decreased with an increase of host abundance in eight flea-host associations, being asymptotic in four of them. On the other hand, mean crowding of fleas increased with an increase in flea abundance in 49 flea-host associations, being asymptotic in 15 of them.
   Results of this study suggest that different flea-host associations are governed by different regulating mechanisms, but different regulation mechanisms may act simultaneously within the same flea-host associations.

TI An indirect approach to imply trade-off shapes: population level
   patterns in resistance suggest a decreasingly costly resistance
   mechanism in a model insect system
AB Trade-offs between life history and other traits play a key role in shaping the evolution of individuals. It is well established theoretically that the shapes of trade-off curves are as crucial to the evolutionary outcome as their strengths. However, measuring the shape of these relationships directly is often impractical. Here we use an indirect approach that examines the patterns seen within a population and then use theory to infer the shape of the trade-off curve. Using a bioassay we found that most individuals had either high susceptibility or relatively high resistance to a microparasite in a lepidopteran host population. According to general theory, this type of pattern in resistance would be most likely with a deceleratingly costly impact on fitness of increasing resistance. The implications and generality of the approach are discussed, along with the implications of the results to our understanding of the nature of innate resistance to parasites.

TI Spatial heterogeneity and the stability of host-parasite coexistence
AB Spatially heterogeneous environments can theoretically promote more stable coexistence of hosts and parasites by reducing the risk of parasite attack either through providing permanent spatial refuges or through providing ephemeral refuges by reducing dispersal. In experimental populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the bacteriophage PP7, spatial heterogeneity promoted stable coexistence of host and parasite, while coexistence was significantly less stable in the homogeneous environment. Phage populations were found to be persisting on subpopulations of sensitive bacteria. Transferring populations to fresh microcosms every 24 h prevented the development of permanent spatial refuges. However, the lower dispersal rates in the heterogeneous environment were found to reduce parasite transmission thereby creating ephemeral refuges from phage attack. These results suggest that spatial heterogeneity can stabilize an otherwise unstable host-parasite interaction even in the absence of permanent spatial refuges.

TI Does selection by resistant hosts trigger local adaptation in
   plant-pathogen systems?
AB Understanding the consequences of selection by host resistance on pathogen population structure provides useful insights into the dynamics of host-parasite co-evolution processes and is crucial for effective disease management through resistant cultivars. We tested general vs. local population adaptation to host cultivars, by characterizing a French collection of Phytophthora infestans (the causal organism of potato late blight) sampled during two consecutive years on cultivars exhibiting various levels of resistance. Local populations were structured by the host for virulence (qualitative pathogenicity) but also for aggressiveness (quantitative pathogenicity). All populations had a low genotypic diversity for amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), and presumably consisted of a few closely related clonal lineages. No correlation was detected between pathogenicity traits and AFLP genotypes. The data support the hypothesis of general adaptation for aggressiveness, to which directional selection for virulence is superimposed when race-specific resistance is introduced.

TI Problem pathogens: prevention of malaria in travellers
AB Human infection with Plasmodium spp leading to clinical episodes of malaria probably began very early in the history of humankind and has persistently inflicted disease among human populations. Malaria is currently considered the world's most important parasitic infection. The global impact of malaria is incalculable and appears to be worsening over the past decades. Although most of this burden of disease is carried by developing tropical countries, cases of imported malaria acquired by international travel are increasingly reported. These numbers are growing because of increased travel to malaria-endemic areas and also due to increased risk of transmission in these areas. indeed, travel has contributed to the global spread of malaria during the history of humankind. Travellers visiting malaria risk areas should use both personal protective measures and chemoprophylaxis. Non-adherence to chemoprophylactic regimens is frequently secondary to drug side-effects. Therefore, a careful risk-benefit analysis on the use of antimalarial. prophylaxis should be carried out in every individual travelling to malaria risk areas. Standby malaria self-treatment represents an alternative in some travellers. However, carefully selected and geographically specific antimalarial drug regimens should be recommended to non-immune people travelling to high-risk areas.

TI Diversity, distribution and exchange of blood parasites meeting at an
   avian moving contact zone
AB Research on contact zones has paid relatively little attention to host-parasite interactions, although these situations have important but different implications depending on whether one considers the host or the parasite's perspective. We investigated both the role of a host contact zone in parasite expansion and whether parasites could influence contact zone dynamics. We studied the diversity and the patterns of parasite exchange (genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium) infecting two parapatric sibling passerines meeting at a moving contact zone in western Europe. We amplified and sequenced a fragment of the parasite cytochrome b gene. The expanding host harboured more diverse parasites, which might indicate a superior ability to face a diverse parasite fauna than the receding host. Prevalence was very high in both hosts, due to the frequent occurrence of two sister Haemoproteus lineages. Despite the recent movement of the contact zone, these two parasites fitted almost perfectly to the geographic range of their main host species. Yet, we found several cases of cross-species infection in sympatric areas and evidences of asymmetrical spreading of parasites from the expanding host towards the receding host. Altogether, our results suggest that the host contact zone mainly acts as a barrier to parasite expansion even if recurrent host shifts are observed. Besides, they also support the idea that parasite-mediated competition might contribute to the displacement of hosts' contact zones, thereby emphasizing the role of parasitism on the population dynamics of sympatric species.

TI Factors affecting the geographic distribution of West Nile virus in
   Georgia, USA: 2002-2004
AB The distribution of West Nile virus (WNV) is dependent on the occurrence of both susceptible avian reservoir hosts and competent mosquito vectors. Both factors can be influenced by geographic variables such as land use/landcover, elevation, human population density, physiographic region, and temperature. The current study uses geographic information systems (GIS) and logistic regression analyses to model the distribution of WNV in the state of Georgia based on a wild bird indicator system, and to identify human and environmental predictor variables that are important in the determination of WNV distribution. A database for Georgia was constructed that included (1) location points of all the avian samples tested for WNV, (2) local land use classifications, including temperature, physiographic divisions, land use/landcover, and elevation, (3) human demographic data from the U.S. Census, and (4) statistics summarizing land cover, elevation, and climate within a 1-km-radius landscape around each sample point. Logistic regression analysis was carried out using the serostatus of avian collection sites as the dependent variable. Temperature, housing density, urban/suburban land use, and mountain physiographic region were important variables in predicting the distribution of WNV in the state of Georgia. While weak, the positive correlation between WNV-antibody positive sites and the urban/suburban environment was consistent throughout the study period. The risks associated with WNV endemicity appear to be increased in urban/suburban areas and decreased in the mountainous region of the state. This information may be used in addressing regional public health needs and mosquito control programs.

AB Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an emerging pathogen throughout much of the Holarctic, where Ixodes spp. tick vectors occur. This organism was expected to be present at study sites in Humboldt County, north-western California, based on the presence of appropriate tick vectors, seropositivity in sentinel hosts, and previously reported human infections. However, despite high seroprevalence suggesting circulating A. phagocytophilum, active infections in dogs and wildlife (including suspected reservoir species) were rare using published polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. This finding was possible if the published PCR protocol lacked sensitivity for strains in the study areas. We report a new TaqMan-PCR (TM-PCR) assay targeting the msp2 gene that has greater sensitivity and specificity for diverse A. phagocytophilum strains from this region. The new assay detected as few as one plasmid copy and a range of genetically diverse strains of A. phagocytophilum. Specificity was confirmed by failure to amplify targets of closely related bacteria. Application of the TM-PCR to samples from northern California confirmed PCR-positivity in 94 woodrats (71%; n = 134), three (4%; n = 80) bears, and seven (7%; n = 97) domestic dogs. The msp2 TM-PCR protocol appears to be more sensitive for use in assays of samples from parts of western North America and possibly in other regions where populations are genetically diverse or divergent from eastern United States strains of A. phagocytophilum.

TI Prevalence and evolutionary relationships of haematozoan parasites in
   native versus introduced populations of common myna Acridotheres tristis
AB The success of introduced species is frequently explained by their escape from natural enemies in the introduced region. We tested the enemy release hypothesis with respect to two well studied blood parasite genera (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) in native and six introduced populations of the common myna Acridotheres tristis. Not all comparisons of introduced populations to the native population were consistent with expectations of the enemy release hypothesis. Native populations show greater overall parasite prevalence than introduced populations, but the lower prevalence in introduced populations is driven by low prevalence in two populations on oceanic islands (Fiji and Hawaii). When these are excluded, prevalence does not differ significantly. We found a similar number of parasite lineages in native populations compared to all introduced populations. Although there is some evidence that common mynas may have carried parasite lineages from native to introduced locations, and also that introduced populations may have become infected with novel parasite lineages, it may be difficult to differentiate between parasites that are native and introduced, because malarial parasite lineages often do not show regional or host specificity.

   symbionts and across temperatures
AB Symbiosis is prevalent throughout the tree of life and has had a significant impact on the ecology and evolution of many bacteria and eukaryotes. The benevolence of symbiotic interactions often varies with the environment, and such variation is expected to play an important role in shaping the prevalence and distributions of symbiosis throughout nature. In this study, we examine how the fitness of aphids is influenced by infection with one of three maternally transmitted bacteria, 'Candidatus Serratia symbiotica', 'Candidatus Hamiltonella defensa' and 'Candidatus Regiella insecticola', addressing how symbiont benevolence varies with temperature. We find that the effects of these 'secondary' symbionts on Acyrthosiphon pisum depend on when and whether aphids are exposed to a brief period of heat shock. We also demonstrate that symbionts-even closely related isolates-vary in their effects on hosts. Our results indicate similar effects of S. symbiotica and H. defensa in conferring tolerance to high temperatures and a liability of R. insecticola under these same conditions. These findings reveal a role for heritable symbionts in the adaptation of aphids to their abiotic environments and add to an expanding body of knowledge on the adaptive significance of symbiosis.

TI Serial passage of the parasite Crithidia bombi within a colony of its
   host, Bombus terrestris, reduces success in unrelated hosts
AB In the wild, Bombus spp. bees may contract infections of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi from their nestmates or from others while foraging on contaminated flowers. We expected that as C. bombi is transmitted repeatedly among related workers within a colony, the parasite population would become more successful in this relatively homogeneous host population and less successful in individuals from unrelated colonies of the same or different species. To test our prediction, we serially passaged cocktails of C. bombi strains through workers from the same colony, taking the intensity of infection in related versus unrelated workers as a measure of parasite success at each step in the serial transfer. Using a repeated measures ANOVA, we found the ability of C. bombi to exploit Bombus spp. hosts did not increase within a colony, but did decrease for infections in workers from unrelated colonies. This reduction in success is most likely due to a gradual loss of appropriate C. bombi strains from the infecting the population as the cocktail is 'filtered' during the serial passage within a given colony, without a corresponding increase in overall intensity of the surviving strains.

Most (73%) P. falciparum patients were parasitologically resistant to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (RI = 10, RII = 1.). Sensitivity of microscopy was lower than PCR (69% for P. vivax and 78% for P. falciparum), but parasite clearance times were comparable between microscopy and PCR. PCR sensitively and specifically detected mixed infections and low-level parasitemia indicative of drug resistance, making this approach of practical use for the control of malaria at the public health level. Genotyping malaria parasites will be useful to distinguish drug failure from new infections in clinical trials of anti-malarial drugs in the Peruvian Amazon region.

TI Low multiplication rates of African Plasmodium falciparum isolates and
   lack of association of multiplication rate and red blood cell
   selectivity with malaria virulence
AB Two potential malaria virulence factors, parasite multiplication rate (PMR) and red blood cell selectivity (measured as selectivity index [SI]), were assessed in Plasmodium falciparian clinical isolates from Mali and Kenya. At both sites, PMRs were low (Kenya median = 2.2, n = 33; Mali median = 2.6, n = 61) and did not differ significantly between uncomplicated and severe malaria cases. Malian isolates from hyperparasitemic patients had significantly lower PMRs (median = 1.8, n = 19) than other Malian isolates (uncomplicated malaria median = 3.1, n = 23; severe malaria median 2.8, n 19; P = 0.03, by Kruskal-Wallis test). Selective invasion occurred at both sites (Kenya geometric mean SI 1.9, n 98; Mali geometric mean ST = t.6, n = 104), and there was no significant association between the SI and malaria severity. Therefore, in contrast to previous results from Thailand, we found no association of PMR and SI with malaria severity in African children. This raises the possibility of differences in the mechanisms of malaria virulence between sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.

TI Frequencies of peripheral blood myeloid cells in healthy Kenyan children
   with alpha+ thalassemia and the sickle cell trait
AB The high frequencies of both alpha+ thalassemia and the sickle cell trait (hemoglobin AS [HbAS]) found in many tropical populations are thought to reflect selection pressure from Plasmodium falciparum malaria. For HbAS, but not for a+ thalassemia, protection appears to be mediated by the enhanced phagocytic clearance of ring-infected erythrocytes. We have investigated the genotype-specific distributions of peripheral blood leukocyte populations in two groups of children living on the coast of Kenya: a group of healthy P. falciparum parasite-negative children sampled at cross-sectional survey during a period of low malaria transmission, and a group of children attending the hospital with acute malaria. We report distinctive distributions of peripheral blood myeloid dendritic cells and monocytes in children with a+ thalassemia and HbAS during healthy periods and disease, and suggest ways in which these might relate to the mechanisms of protection afforded by these conditions.

TI Determinants of vector specificity of o'nyong nyong and chikungunya
   viruses in Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes
AB The alphaviruses o'nyong nyong virus (ONNV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) provide a unique system to study the viral genes involved in vector specificity. ONNV infects both anopheline and culicine mosquitoes, whereas CHIKV infects only culicine mosquitoes. In this study, chimeric viruses were constructed that contained genes from both ONNV and CHIKV. These chimeras and previously described full-length infectious clones of ONNV and CHIKV were evaluated in Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Virus derived from the infectious clones of ONNV and CHIKV retained the vector specificity of the parental viruses. All six of the chimeras were found to infect Ae. aegypti mosquitoes at high rates but only the chimera containing viral genes encoding all of the structural proteins of ONNV was able to infect An. gambiae mosquitoes. These data indicate that all of the viral structural proteins are necessary for ONNV to infect An. gambiae mosquitoes.

TI Prediction of parasite infection dynamics in primate metapopulations
   based on attributes of forest fragmentation
AB Although the effects of forest fragmentation on species and ecological processes have been the focus of considerable research in conservation biology, our capacity to predict how processes will be altered and which taxonomic or functional groups will be most affected by fragmentation is still poor. This problem is exacerbated by inherent temporal and spatial variability in fragment attributes. To improve our understanding of this interplay, we examined how various fragment attributes affect one potentially important ecological process, parasite infection dynamics, and considered how changes in this process affect host metapopulations. From August 1999 to July 2003 we surveyed red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) metapopulations inhabiting nine fragments (1.2 to 8.7 ha) in western Uganda to determine the prevalence and richness of strongyle and rhabditoid nematodes, a group of potentially pathogenic gastrointestinal parasites. We used noninvasive fecal flotation and sedimentation (n = 536) to detect parasite eggs, cysts, and larvae in colobus fecal samples. To obtain an index of infection risk, we determined environmental contamination with Oesophagostomum sp., a representative strongyle nematode, in canopy (n = 30) and ground vegetation plots (n = 30). Concurrently, physical (i.e., size, location, and topography) and biological (i.e., tree diversity, tree density, stump density, and colobine density) attributes were quantified for each fragment. Interfragment comparisons of nine potential factors demonstrated that an index of degradation and human presence (tree stump density) strongly influenced the prevalence of parasitic nematodes. Infection risk was also higher in the fragment with the highest stump density than in the fragment with the lowest stump density. These results demonstrate that host-parasite dynamics can be altered in complex ways by forest fragmentation and that intensity of extraction (e.g., stump density) best explains these changes.

TI Parasite genotypes identify source populations of migratory fish more
   accurately than fish genotypes
AB DNA-based assignment of individuals to their population of origin has many applications such as mixed-stock analysis, identifying individuals from protected Populations, and elucidating migration patterns. However, low genetic differentiation among populations will cause misassignments. Thus, an alternative means of determining an individual's population of origin is needed in cases where there is little or no neutral differentiation among Source populations. Here, we test the hypothesis that parasite genotypes can be used to identify the origins of hosts more accurately than host genotypes. Using microsatellite markers from steelhead trout and their trematode parasites, we show that the odds of correct assignment are Four times greater with the parasite's genotypes than with the host's genotypes. Our analyses show that this result is simply explained by the greater genetic structure among populations of the trematode parasite. Recent studies on the comparative genetic structure of other host and parasite species suggest that Our results are not unusual or unique to the host-parasite system we studied. Thus, our work indicates that parasites will be useful for a wide range of applied and basic research that requires the assignment of individuals to source populations.

TI Inferring evolutionary signals from ecological data in a plant-pathogen
   metapopulation
AB We followed the dynamics of local epidemics in three populations of a natural plant-pathogen system for four sequential years. We characterize the overwintering process with spatial statistics and use a stochastic, spatially explicit, modeling approach with Bayesian parameter estimation to study the spread of the infection during the growing season. Our modeling approach allows us to infer coevolutionary signals from spatiotemporal data on pathogen prevalence. Most importantly, we are able to assess the distribution of resistant hosts within the distribution of all host plants. We show that resistant hosts occur in areas with high pathogen encounter rates, and that the occurrence of resistance correlates with overwintering probability of the pathogen. The estimates for essentially all model parameters are characterized by a large amount of variation over the years and the populations. While the variation in the fraction of resistant hosts and in the force of infection is to a large extent explained by the population, the,other model parameters (two parameters describing the shape of the dispersal kernel) vary essentially in an unpredictable manner, suggesting that much of the variation may occur at very fine spatial and temporal scales.

TI Biological control agents elevate hantavirus by subsidizing deer mouse
   populations
AB Biological control of exotic invasive plants using exotic insects is practiced under the assumption that biological control agents are safe if they do not directly attack non-target species. We tested this assumption by evaluating the potential for two host-specific biological control agents (Urophora spp.), widely established in North America for spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) control, to indirectly elevate Sin Nombre hantavirus by providing food subsidies to populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), the primary reservoir for the virus. We show that seropositive deer mice (mice testing positive for hantavirus) were over three times more abundant in the presence of the biocontrol food subsidy. Elevating densities of seropositive mice may increase risk of hantavirus infection in humans and significantly alter hantavirus ecology. Host specificity alone does not ensure safe biological control. To minimize indirect risks to non-target species, biological control agents must suppress pest populations enough to reduce their own numbers.

TI Seasonality and the dynamics of infectious diseases
AB Seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong pressures on population dynamics. Infectious diseases provide some of the best-studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host-pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and that population-level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite-host systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well-studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions.

TI Effects of species diversity on disease risk
AB The transmission of infectious diseases is an inherently ecological process involving interactions among at least two, and often many, species. Not surprisingly, then, the species diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies have now identified effects of diversity on disease prevalence, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in specific disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate under what general conditions host diversity should increase or decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples. Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk. Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying focal areas for future research, including (1) describing patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2) identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating disease systems to assess the impact of proposed mechanisms.

TI Confronting zoonoses, linking human and veterinary medicine
AB Many of the emerging infectious diseases, including those caused by bioterrorist agents, are zoonoses. Since zoonoses can infect both animals and humans, the medical and veterinary communities should work closely together in clinical, public health, and research settings. In the clinical setting, input from both professions would improve assessments of the risk-benefit ratios of pet ownership, particularly for pet owners who are immunocompromised. In public health, human and animal disease surveillance systems are important in tracking and controlling zoonoses such as avian influenza virus, West Nile virus, and foodborne pathogens. Comparative medicine is the study of disease processes across species, including humans. Physician and veterinarian comparative medicine research teams should be promoted and encouraged to study zoonotic agent-host interactions. These efforts would increase our understanding of how zoonoses expand their host range and would, ultimately, improve prevention and control strategies.

We first assessed the genetic population structures of B. burgdorferi in ticks obtained from different mammalian host species and in questing ticks sampled in a woodland ecosystem in Connecticut. By comparing the patterns found in our study with data from another cross-sectional study, we demonstrate that B. burgdorferi is a generalist microparasite and conclude that efficient cross-species transmission of B. burgdorferi is a key feature that has allowed the rapid spread of Lyme borreliosis across the northeastern United States.

TI Animals as sentinels of bioterrorism agents
AB We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature from 1966 to 2005 to determine whether animals could provide early warning of a bioterrorism attack, serve as markers for ongoing exposure risk, and amplify or propagate a bioterrorism outbreak. We found evidence that, for certain bioterrorism agents, pets, wildlife, or livestock could provide early warning and that for other agents, humans would likely manifest symptoms before illness could be detected in animals. After an acute attack, active surveillance of wild or domestic animal populations could help identify many ongoing exposure risks. If certain bioterrorism agents found their way into animal populations, they could spread widely through animal-to-animal transmission and prove difficult to control. The public health infrastructure must look beyond passive surveillance of acute animal disease events to build capacity for active surveillance and intervention efforts to detect and control ongoing outbreaks of disease in domestic and wild animal populations.

TI How exposures to biologics influence the induction and incidence of
   asthma
AB A number of environmental factors can affect the development and severity of allergy and asthma; however, it can be argued that the most significant inhaled agents that modulate the development of these conditions are biologics. Sensitization to environmental allergens is an important risk factor for the development of asthma. Innate immune responses are often mediated by receptors on mononuclear cells whose primary ligands arise from microorganisms. Many pathogens, especially viruses, target epithelial cells and affect the host immune response to those pathogens. The acquired immune response to an allergen is influenced by the nature of the innate immune system. Products of innate immune responses to microbes promote T(H)1-acquired responses. In the absence of T(H)1 responses, T(H)2 responses can dominate. Central to T(H)1/T(H)2 balance is the composition of contaminants that derive from microbes. In this review we examine the biology of the response to allergens, viruses, and bacterial products in the context of the development of allergy and asthma.

Our meta-analysis, which included all identified studies except those on wild animal handlers, yielded an overall seroprevalence of 0.10% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.18]. Health-care workers and others who had close contact with SARS patients had a slightly higher degree of seroconversion (0.23%, 95% CI 0.02-0.45) compared to healthy blood donors, others from the general community or non-SARS patients recruited from the health-care setting (0.16%, 95% CI 0-0.37). When analysed by the two broad classes of testing procedures, it is clear that serial confirmatory test protocols resulted in a much lower estimate (0.050%, 95% CI 0-0.15) than single test protocols (0.20%, 95% CI 0.06-0.34). Potential epidemiological and laboratory pitfalls are also discussed as they may give rise to false or inconsistent results in measuring the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV.

TI Cyto-nuclear epistasis: Two-locus random genetic drift in hermaphroditic
   and dioecious species
AB We report the findings of our theoretical investigation of the effect of random genetic drift on the covariance of identity-by-descent (ibd) Of nuclear and cytoplasmic genes. The covariance in ibd measures of the degree to which cyto-nuclear gene combinations are heritable, that is, transmitted together from parents to offspring. We show how the mating system affects the covariance of ibd, a potentially important aspect of host-pathogen or host-symbiont coevolution. The magnitude of this covariance influences the degree to which the evolution of apparently neutral cytoplasmic genes, often used in molecular phylogenetics, might be influenced by selection acting on unlinked nuclear genes. To the extent that cyto-nuclear gene combinations are inherited together, genomic conflict is mitigated and intergenomic transfer it facilitated, because genes in both organelle and nuclear genomes share the same evolutionary fate. The covariance of ibd also affects the rate at which cyto-nuclear epistatic variance is converted to additive variance necessary for a response to selection. We find that conversion is biased in species with separate sexes, so that the increment of additive variance added to the nuclear genome exceeds that added to the cytoplasmic genome. As a result, the host might have an adaptive advantage in a coevolutionary arms race with vertically (maternally) transmitted pathogens. Similarly, the nuclear genome could be a Source of compensatory mutations for its organellar genomes, as occurs in cytoplasmic male sterility in some plant species. We also discuss the possibility that adaptive cytoplasmic elements, such as favorable mitochondrial mutations or endosymbionts (e.g., Wolbachia), have the potential to release heritable nuclear variation as they sweep through a host Population, Supporting the view that cytoplasmic introgression plays in important role in adaptation and speciation.

TI Genetic variation in MHC class II expression and interactions with MHC
   sequence polymorphism in three-spined sticklebacks
AB Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been studied for several decades because of their pronounced allelic polymorphism. Structural allelic polymorphism is, however, not the only source of variability subjected to natural selection. Genetic variation may also exist in gene expression patterns. Here, we show that in a natural population of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) the expression of MHC class IIB genes was positively correlated with parasite load, which indicates increased immune activation of the MHC when infections are frequent. To experimentally study MHC expression, we used laboratory-bred sticklebacks that were exposed to three naturally occurring species of parasite. We found strong differences in MHC class IIB expression patterns among fish families, which were consistent over two generations, thus demonstrating a genetic component. The average number of MHC class IIB sequence variants within families was negatively correlated to the MHC expression level suggesting compensatory up-regulation in fish with a low (i.e. suboptimal) MHC sequence variability. The observed differences among families and the negative correlation with individual sequence diversity imply that MHC expression is evolutionary relevant for the onset and control of the immune response in natural populations.

TI Functional genomics of Buchnera and the ecology of aphid hosts
AB In many animal groups, mutualistic bacterial symbionts play a central role in host ecology, by provisioning rare nutrients and thus enabling specialization on restricted diets. Among such symbionts, genomic studies are most advanced for Buchnera, the obligate symbiont of aphids, which feed on phloem sap. The contents of the highly reduced Buchnera genomes have verified its role in aphid nutrition. Comparisons of Buchnera gene sets indicate ongoing, irreversible gene losses that are expected to affect aphid nutritional needs. Furthermore, almost all regulatory genes have been eliminated, raising the question of whether and how gene expression responds to environmental change. Microarray studies on genome-wide expression indicate that Buchnera has evolved some constitutive changes in gene expression: homologues of heat stress genes have elevated transcript levels in Buchnera (relative to other bacteria) even in the absence of stress. Additionally, the microarray results indicate that responses to heat stress and to amino acid availability are both few and modest. Observed responses are consistent with control by the few ancestral regulators retained in the genome. Initial studies on the role of host genes in mediating the symbiosis reveal distinctive expression patterns in host cells harbouring Buchnera. In the near future, a complete genome of pea aphid will accelerate progress in understanding the functional integration of aphid and Buchnera genomes. Although information for other insect symbioses is relatively limited, studies on symbionts of carpenter ants and tsetse flies indicate many similarities to Buchnera.

TI A cDNA macroarray approach to parasite-induced gene expression changes
   in a songbird host: genetic response of house finches to experimental
   infection by Mycoplasma gallisepticum
AB In 1994, the bacterial parasite Mycoplasma gallisepticum expanded its host range and swept through populations of a novel host - eastern US populations of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). This epizootic caused a dramatic decline in finch population numbers, has been shown to have caused strong selection on house finch morphology, and presumably caused evolutionary change at the molecular level as finches evolved enhanced resistance. As a first step toward identifying finch genes that respond to infection by Mycoplasma and which may have experienced natural selection by this parasite, we used suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA macroarray approaches to identify differentially expressed genes regulated by the Mycoplasma parasite. Two subtractive cDNA libraries consisting of 16 512 clones were developed from spleen using an experimentally uninfected bird as the 'tester' and an infected bird as 'driver', and vice versa. Two hundred and twenty cDNA clones corresponding 34 genes with known vertebrate homologues and a large number of novel transcripts were found to be qualitatively up- or down-regulated genes by high-density filter hybridization. These gene expression changes were further confirmed by a high throughout reverse Northern blot approach and in specific cases by targeted Northern analysis. BLAST searches show that heat shock protein (HSP) 90, MHC II-associated invariant chain (CD74), T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 1 (TIM1), as well as numerous novel expressed genes not found in the databases were up- or down-regulated by the host in response to this parasite. Our results and macroarray resources provide a foundation for molecular co-evolutionary studies of the Mycoplasma parasite and its recently colonized avian host.

TI Inference of cowpox virus transmission rates between wild rodent host
   classes using space-time interaction
AB There have been virtually no studies of 'who acquires infection from whom' in wildlife populations, but patterns of transmission within and between different classes of host are likely to be reflected in the spatiotemporal distribution of infection among those host classes. Here, we use a modified form of K-function analysis to test for space-time interaction among bank voles and wood mice infectious with cowpox virus. There was no evidence for transmission between the two host species, supporting previous evidence that they act as separate reservoirs for cowpox. Among wood mice, results suggested that transmission took place primarily between individuals of the opposite sex, raising the possibility that cowpox is sexually transmitted in this species. Results for bank voles indicated that infected females might be a more important source of infection to either sex than are males. The suggestion of different modes of transmission in the two species is itself consistent with the apparent absence of transmission between species.

TI Dynamics of deletion genotypes in an experimental insect virus
   population
AB Defective viruses, that are deficient in certain essential genes, are maintained in the population by transcomplementation, exploiting the gene products of complete genotypes in co-infected cells. This process becomes prevalent only when cells are frequently infected by several virus particles, and only then will the fitness of defective viruses be subjected to frequency-dependent selection. Deletion variants that are not infectious per os are present in a multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (SfMNPV, Baculoviridae) that infects the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda. These variants enhance the pathogenicity and, therefore, the likelihood of transmission of the virus when co-infecting cells with complete genotypes, resulting in occlusion bodies (OBs) that may contain both genotypes co-occluded. Mixtures of complete (B) and defective (C) variants in ratios of 90% B + 10% C, 50% B + 50%) C and 10% B + 90% C were used to inoculate by injection S. frugiperda larvae. Viral OBs extracted from diseased insects were subjected to four or five successive rounds of per os infection. Following successive passages, genotype frequencies in all three experimental populations converged to a single equilibrium frequency comprising similar to 20% of deletion genotype C and similar to 80% of complete genotype B. This mirrors the relative proportions of deletion (22%) and complete (78%) genotypes observed in the wild-type SfMNPV population. The pathogenicity of experimental populations at the final passage was not significantly different from that of the wild-type isolate. In contrast, OBs of all genotype mixtures were significantly more pathogenic than OBs of genotype B alone. A population genetics model, in which virus populations were assigned linear frequency-dependent transmissibility values, was in remarkably close agreement to empirical data. Clearly, noninfectious deletion variants can profoundly affect the likelihood of transmission and the genetic structure and stability of virus populations.

TI Wolbachia infection suppresses both host defence and parasitoid
   counter-defence
AB Endosymbiotic bacteria in the genus Wolbachia have been linked to several types of reproductive parasitism, which enhance their own transmission, while their direct effects on the host vary from beneficial to neutral or detrimental. Here, we report negative effects of infection on immunity-related traits of Drosophila simulans and the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina heterotoma. Infected D. simulans showed a reduced ability to encapsulate parasitoid eggs, compared to a tetracycline-treated, bacterium-free line. Challenging the two lines with a fungal pathogen, Beauveria bassiana, on the other hand, revealed no differences in survival. Moreover, elimination of Wolbachia was beneficial for the parasitoid wasp, as eggs laid by uninfected females suffered significantly lower encapsulation rates. We discuss possible origins of these fitness costs and their implications for infection dynamics and the interactions between host species.

TI Disease ecology in the Galapagos Hawk (Buteo galapagoensis): host
   genetic diversity, parasite load and natural antibodies
AB An increased susceptibility to disease is one hypothesis explaining how inbreeding hastens extinction in island endemics and threatened species. Experimental studies show that disease resistance declines as inbreeding increases, but data from in situ wildlife systems are scarce. Genetic diversity increases with island size across the entire range of an extremely inbred Galapagos endemic bird, providing the context for a natural experiment examining the effects of inbreeding on disease susceptibility. Extremely inbred populations of Galapagos hawks had higher parasite abundances than relatively outbred populations. We found a significant island effect on constitutively produced natural antibody (NAb) levels and inbred populations generally harboured lower average and less variable NAb levels than relatively outbred populations. Furthermore, NAb levels explained abundance of amblyceran lice, which encounter the host immune system. This is the first study linking inbreeding, innate immunity and parasite load in an endemic, in situ wildlife population and provides a clear framework for assessment of disease risk in a Galapagos endemic.

TI Dynamics of multiple symbiont density regulation during host
   development: tsetse fly and its microbial flora
AB Symbiotic associations often enhance hosts' physiological capabilities, allowing them to expand into restricted terrains, thus leading to biological diversification. Stable maintenance of partners is essential for the overall biological system to succeed. The viviparous tsetse fly (Diptera: Glossinidae) offers an exceptional system to examine factors that influence the maintenance of multiple symbiotic organisms within a single eukaryotic host. This insect harbours three different symbionts representing diverse associations, coevolutionary histories and transmission modes. The enterics, obligate mutualist Wigglesworthia and beneficial Sodalis, are maternally transmitted to the intrauterine larvae, while parasitic Wolbachia infects the developing oocyte. In this study, the population dynamics of these three symbionts were examined through host development and during potentially disruptive events, including host immune challenge, the presence of third parties (such as African trypanosomes) and environmental perturbations (such as fluctuating humidity levels). While mutualistic partners exhibited well-regulated density profiles over different host developmental stages, parasitic Wolbachia infections varied in individual hosts. Host immune status and the presence of trypanosome infections did not impact the steady-state density levels observed for mutualistic microbes in either sex, while these factors resulted in an increase in Wolbachia density in males. Interestingly, perturbation of the maternal environment resulted in the deposition of progeny harbouring greater overall symbiont loads. The regulation of symbiont density, arising from coadaptive processes, may be an important mechanism driving inter-specific relations to ensure their competitive survival and to promote specialization of beneficial associations.

TI Parasites as causative agents of human affective disorders? The impact
   of anti-psychotic, mood-stabilizer and anti-parasite medication on
   Toxoplasma gondii's ability to alter host behaviour
AB With increasing pressure to understand transmissible agents, renewed recognition of infectious causation of both acute and chronic diseases is occurring. Epidemiological and neuropathological studies indicate that some cases of schizophrenia may be associated with environmental factors, such as exposure to the ubiquitous protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. Reasons for this include T gondii's ability to establish persistent infection within the central nervous system, its ability to manipulate intermediate host behaviour, the occurrence of neurological and psychiatric symptoms in some infected individuals, and an association between infection with increased incidence of schizophrenia. Moreover, several of the medications used to treat schizophrenia and other psychiatric disease have recently been demonstrated in vitro to possess antiparasitic, and in particular anti-T gondii, properties. Our aim here was thus to test the hypothesis that the anti-psychotic and mood stabilizing activity of some medications may be achieved, or at least augmented, through their in vivo inhibition of T gondii replication and invasion in infected individuals. In particular we predicted, using the epidemiologically and clinically applicable rat-T gondii model system, and following a previously described and neurologically characterized 'feline attraction' protocol that haloperidol (an antipsychotic used in the treatment of mental illnesses including schizophrenia) and/or valproic acid (a mood stabilizer used in the treatment of mental illnesses including schizophrenia), would be, at least, as effective in preventing the development of T gondii-associated behavioural and cognitive alterations as the standard anti-T gondii chemotherapeutics pyrimethamine with Dapsone. We demonstrate that, while T gondii appears to alter the rats' perception of predation risk turning their innate aversion into a 'suicidal' feline attraction, anti-psychotic drugs prove as efficient as anti-T gondii drugs in preventing such behavioural alterations. Our results have important implications regarding the aetiology and treatment of such disorders.

TI Temperature-dependent transmission and latency of Holospora undulata, a
   micronucleus-specific parasite of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum
AB Transmission of parasites to new hosts crucially depends on the timing of production of transmission stages and their capacity to start an infection. These parameters may be influenced by genetic factors, but also by the environment. We tested the effects of temperature and host genotype on infection probability and latency in experimental populations of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum, after exposure to infectious forms of its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Temperature had a significant effect on the expression of genetic variation for transmission and maintenance of infection. Overall, low temperature (10 degrees C) increased levels of (multiple) infection, but arrested parasite development; higher temperatures (23 and 30 degrees C) accelerated the onset of production of infectious forms, but limited transmission success. Viability of infectious forms declined rapidly at 23 and 30 degrees C, thereby narrowing the time window for transmission. Thus, environmental conditions can generate trade-offs between transmission relevant parameters and alter levels of multiple infection or parasite-mediated selection, which may affect evolutionary trajectories of parasite life history or virulence.

TI Important experimental parameters for determining infection rates in
   arthropod vectors using pool screening approaches
AB Measuring transmission of a vector-borne infection is essential to understanding infection dynamics. When infection prevalence in the vector population is low, transmission is often measured by pool screening (also referred to as group testing). Several investigators have developed statistical methods to recover infection prevalence estimates from pool screen data. These are based on models that contain certain assumptions, and a pool screening approach must be designed to take these into account if accurate estimates of infection prevalence are to be obtained. Here we describe these assumptions and discuss appropriate sampling protocols. The sources of error inherent in pool screening are described, and we show that, under most conditions in which one Would want to use group testing, most of the error results from sampling and not the pooling process. Issues involved in developing a sampling protocol, including the total number of insects to be screened and optimal pool size, are explored. The meaning of confidence intervals associated with prevalence estimates and the appropriate interpretation of these intervals are discussed.

TI Combined human and porcine mass chemotherapy for the control of T-solium
AB A combined (human and porcine) mass chemotherapy program was tested in a controlled design in 12 village hamlets in the Peruvian highlands. A single dose of 5 mg of praziquantel was given to eliminate intestinal taeniasis in humans, and two rounds of oxfendazole (30 mg/kg) were administered to all pigs. The total population in the study villages was 5,658 resident individuals, and the porcine population at the beginning of the study was 716 pigs. Human treatment coverage was 75%, ranging from 69% to 80%. There were only a few refusals of owners for porcine treatment of their animals. The effect of the intervention was measured by comparing incidence rates (seroconversion in pigs who were seronegative 4 months before) in treatment versus control villages, before and up to 18 months after treatment. There was a clear effect in decreasing prevalence (odds ratio, 0.51; P < 0.001) and incidence (odds ratio, 0.39; P = 0.013) in the treatment area after the intervention, which did not leave to extinction of the parasite but stabilized in slightly decreased rates persisting along the follow-up period. Mass chemotherapy was effective in decreasing infection pressure in this hyperendemic area. However, the magnitude of the effect was small and did not attain the goal of eliminating transmission.

TI Risk factors for HTLV-II infection in Peruvian men who have sex with men
AB Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-II (HTLV-II) infection is endemic in indigenous groups in the Americas and injection drug users (IDUs) worldwide. In Peru, HTLV-II infection was previously identified in two indigenous Amazonians. We examined risk factors for HTLV-II infection in 2,703 Peruvian men who have sex with men (MSM): 35 (1.3%) were HTLV-II positive. HTLV-II infection was associated with syphilis, HSV-2 infection, unprotected receptive anal intercourse, and older age. This is the first report of HTLV-II in a non-indigenous non-IDU population in Peru. Additional studies are needed to determine if HTLV-II is a sexually transmitted infection in this and other sexually active populations.

TI Independent and competing disease risks: Implications for host
   Populations in variable environments
AB Disease models usually assume disease to act independently of other mortality- and morbidity-causing factors. Alternatively, disease may function as a competing risk factor, for example, killing already moribund hosts. Using tuberculosis (TB) in African buffalo as a model system, we explore consequences of competing or independent disease effects for host population dynamics. We include scenarios with density-dependent and density-independent effects of environmental variation, exemplified by variable food availability (driven by rainfall) and catastrophic droughts, respectively. Independent disease effects reduce population size linearly with prevalence, irrespective of the nature of environmental variation. Competing disease risks alter population size only if density-independent variation is present; then, disease reduces population size nonlinearly. Field data indicate that the net effect of TB on buffalo likely falls between the extremes of total independence and competition with other risk factors: TB increases mortality and decreases fecundity in some prime- aged buffalo, suggesting independent disease risks in these individuals, while similar disease effects in senescent buffalo may act as competing risks. Moreover, increased survival and fecundity of TB-negative buffalo may compensate for some disease-related losses. Model assumptions on independent or competing disease risks and environmental variability should be considered explicitly when assessing disease effects on wildlife populations.

TI Parasitism and a shortage of refuges jointly mediate the strength of
   density dependence in a reef fish
AB Various predator-prey, host-pathogen, and competitive interactions can combine to cause density dependence in population growth. Despite this possibility, most empirical tests for density-dependent interactions have focused on single mechanisms. Here we tested the hypothesis that two mechanisms of density dependence, parasitism and a shortage of refuges, jointly influence the strength of density-dependent mortality. We used mark-recapture analysis to estimate mortality of the host species, the bridled goby (Coryphoplerus glaucofraenum). Sixty-three marked gobies were infected with a copepod gill parasite (Pharodes tortugensis), and 188 were uninfected. We used the spatial scale at which gobies were clustered naturally (similar to 4 m(2)) as an ecologically relevant neighborhood and measured goby density and the availability of refuges from predators within each goby's neighborhood. Goby survival generally declined with increasing density, and this decline was steeper for gobies with access to few refuges than for gobies in neighborhoods where refuges were common. The negative effects of high density and refuge shortage were also more severe for parasitized gobies than for gobies free of parasites. This parasite has characteristics typical of emerging diseases and appears to have altered the strength of a preexisting density-dependent interaction.

TI Tuberculosis transmission attributable to close contacts and HIV status,
   Malawi
AB We conducted the first molecular study of tuberculosis (TB) to estimate the role of household contact and transmission from HIV-positive putative source contacts (PSCs) in a high HIV-prevalence area. TB patients in a long-term population-based study in Malawi were asked about past contact with TB. DNA fingerprinting was used to define clusters of cases with identical strains. Among 143 epidemiologically defined PSC-case pairs, fingerprinting confirmed transmission for 44% of household and family contacts and 18% of other contacts. Transmission was less likely to be confirmed if the PSC were HIV positive than if he or she were HIV negative (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14-0.74). Overall, epidemiologic links were found for 11% of 754 fingerprint-clustered cases. We estimate that 9%-13% of TB cases were attributable to recent transmission from identifiable close contacts and that nearly half of the TB cases arising from recent infection had acquired the infection from HIV-positive patients.

TI Novel swine influenza virus subtype H3N1, United States
AB Influenza A virus infects various animal species and transmits among different hosts, especially between humans and swine. Swine may serve as a mixing vessel to create new reassortants that could infect humans. Thus, monitoring and characterizing influenza viruses in swine are important in preventing interspecies transmission. We report the emergence and characterization of a novel H3N1 subtype of swine influenza virus (SIV) in the United States. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the H3N1 SIVs may have acquired the hemagglutinin gene from an H3N2 turkey isolate, the neuraminidase gene from a human H1N1 isolate, and the remaining genes from currently circulating SIVs. The H3N1 SIVs were antigenically related to the turkey virus. Lung lesions and nasal shedding occurred in swine infected with the H3N1 SIVs, suggesting the potential to transmit among swine and to humans. Further surveillance will help determine whether this novel subtype will continue to circulate in swine populations.

AB In this study we examined the impact of weather variability and tides on the transmission of Barmah Forest virus (BFV) disease and developed a weather-based forecasting model for BFV disease in the Gladstone region, Australia. We used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving-average (SARIMA) models to determine the contribution of weather variables to BFV transmission after the time-series data of response and explanatory variables were made stationary through seasonal differencing. We obtained data on the monthly counts of BFV cases, weather variables (e.g., mean minimum and maximum temperature, total rainfall, and mean relative humidity), high and low tides, and the population size in the Gladstone region between January 1992 and December 2001 from the Queensland Department of Health, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Queensland Department of Transport, and Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. The SARIMA model shows that the 5-month moving average of minimum temperature (beta = 0.15, p-value < 0.001) was statistically significantly and positively associated with BFV disease, whereas high tide in the current month (beta = -1.03, p-value = 0.04) was statistically significantly and inversely associated with it. However, no significant association was found for other variables. These results may be applied to forecast the occurrence of BFV disease and to use public health resources in BFV control and prevention.

TI Imperfect vaccines and the evolution of pathogens causing acute
   infections in vertebrates
AB A study by Gandon et al. (2001) considered the potential ways pathogens may evolve in response to vaccination with imperfect vaccines. In this paper, by focusing on acute infections of vertebrate hosts, we examine whether imperfect vaccines that do not completely block a pathogen's replication (antigrowth) or transmission (antitransmission) may lead to evolution of more or less virulent pathogen strains. To address this question, we use models of the within-host dynamics of the pathogen and the host's immune responses. One advantage of the use of this within-host approach is that vaccination can be easily incorporated in the models and the trade-offs between pathogen transmissibility, host recovery, and virulence that drive evolution of pathogens in these models can be easily estimated. We find that the use of either antigrowth or antitransmission vaccines leads to the evolution of pathogens with an increased within-host growth rate; infection of unvaccinated hosts with such evolved pathogens results in high host mortality and low pathogen transmission. Vaccination of only a fraction of hosts with antigrowth vaccines may prevent pathogens from evolving high virulence due to pathogen adaptation to unvaccinated hosts and thus protection of vaccinated hosts from pathogen-induced disease. In contrast, antitransmission vaccines may be beneficial only if they are effective enough to cause pathogen extinction. Our results suggest that particular mechanisms of action of vaccines and their efficacy are crucial in predicting longterm evolutionary consequences of the use of imperfect vaccines.

TI Identifying fitness and optimal life-history strategies for an asexual
   filamentous fungus
AB Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous and ecologically important organisms with rich and varied life histories, however, there is no consensus on how to identify or measure their fitness. In the first part of this study we adapt a general epidemiological model to identify the appropriate fitness metric for a saprophytic filamentous fungus. We find that fungal fitness is inversely proportional to the equilibrium density of uncolonized fungal resource patches which, in turn, is a function of the expected spore production of a fungus. In the second part of this study we use a simple life history model of the same fungus within a resource patch to show that a bang-bang resource allocation strategy maximizes the expected spore production, a critical fitness component. Unlike bang-bang strategies identified in other life-history studies, we find that the optimal allocation strategy for saprophytes does not entail the use of all of the resources within a patch.

TI Asymmetric gene flow and constraints on adaptation caused by sex ratio
   distorters
AB Asymmetric gene flow is generally believed to oppose natural selection and potentially impede adaptation. Whilst the cause of asymmetric gene flow has been seen largely in terms of variation in population density over space, asymmetric gene flow can also result from varying sex ratios across subpopulations with similar population sizes. We model the process of adaptation in a scenario in which two adjacent subpopulations have different sex ratios, associated with different levels of infection with maternally inherited endosymbionts that selectively kill male hosts. Two models are analyzed in detail. First, we consider one host locus with two alleles, each of which possesses a selective advantage in one of the subpopulations. We found that local adaptation can strongly be impeded in the subpopulation with the more female biased population sex ratio. Second, we analyze host alleles that provide resistance against the male-killing (MK) endosymbionts and show that asymmetric gene flow can prevent the spread of such alleles under certain conditions. These results might have important implications for the coevolution of MK bacteria and their hosts.

TI Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion and traversal across an in vitro
   human blood-brain barrier as a pathogenic mechanism for central nervous
   system tuberculosis
AB Background. Central nervous system ( CNS) tuberculosis is a serious, often fatal disease that disproportionately affects young children. It is thought to develop when Mycobacterium tuberculosis breaches the blood-brain barrier ( BBB), which is composed of tightly apposed brain microvascular endothelial cells. However, the mechanism( s) involved in this process are poorly understood.
   Methods To better understand these processes, we developed an in vitro model of M. tuberculosis BBB infection using primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells.
   Results. M. tuberculosis was found to both invade and traverse the model BBB significantly more than did M. smegmatis ( a nonpathogenic mycobacterium). Invasion by M. tuberculosis across the BBB required host-cell actin cytoskeletal rearrangements. By microarray expression profiling, we found 33 M. tuberculosis genes to be highly up-regulated during the early stages of invasion of the BBB by M. tuberculosis; 18 of them belong to a previously described in vivo-expressed genomic island ( Rv0960-Rv1001). Defined M. tuberculosis isogenic transposon mutants for the up-regulated genes Rv0980c, Rv0987, Rv0989c, and Rv1801 were found to be deficient in their ability to invade the BBB model.
   Conclusions. We developed an in vitro model of M. tuberculosis BBB infection and identified M. tuberculosis genes that may be involved in CNS invasion.

TI The evolution of parasite manipulation of host dispersal
AB We investigate the evolution of manipulation of host dispersal behaviour by parasites using spatially explicit individual-based simulations. We find that when dispersal is local, parasites always gain from increasing their hosts' dispersal rate, although the evolutionary outcome is determined by the costs-to-benefits ratio. However, when dispersal can be non-local, we show that parasites investing in an intermediate dispersal distance of their hosts are favoured even when the manipulation is not costly, due to the intrinsic spatial dynamics of the host-parasite interaction. Our analysis highlights the crucial importance of ecological spatial dynamics in evolutionary processes and reveals the theoretical possibility that parasites could manipulate their hosts' dispersal.

TI Bumble-bee foragers infected by a gut parasite have an impaired ability
   to utilize floral information
AB Parasitic infection can influence a variety of behavioural mechanisms in animals, but little is known about the effects of infection on the cognitive processes underlying ecologically relevant behaviours. Here, we examined whether parasitic infection alters cognitive aspects of foraging in a social insect, the bumble-bee (Bombus impatiens). In controlled experiments, we assessed the ability of foraging bees to discriminate rewarding from non-rewarding flowers on the basis of colour and odour. We found that natural and experimental infection by a protozoan parasite (Crithidia bombi, which lives exclusively within the gut tract), impaired the ability of foragers to learn the colour of rewarding flowers. Parasitic infection can thus disrupt central nervous system pathways that mediate cognitive processes in bumble-bees and as a consequence, can reduce their ability to monitor floral resources and make economic foraging decisions. It is postulated that this infection-induced change to cognitive function in bumble-bees is the result of communication between immune and nervous systems. Parasitized animals, including invertebrates, can therefore show subtle behavioural changes that are nonetheless ecologically significant and reflect complex mechanisms.

TI Complex Mhc-based mate choice in a wild passerine
AB The extreme polymorphism of the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) is famous for protecting hosts against constantly evolving pathogens. Mate choice is often evoked as a means of maintaining Mhc variability through avoidance of partners with similar Mhc alleles or preference for heterozygotes. Evidence for these two hypotheses mostly comes from studies on humans and laboratory mice. Here, we tested these hypotheses in a wild outbred population of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Females were not more or less closely related to the males they paired with when considering neutral genetic variation. However, males failed to form breeding pairs when they had too few Mhc alleles and when they were too dissimilar from females at Mhc loci (i.e. had no common alleles). Furthermore, pairs did not form at random as Mhc diversity positively correlated in mating pairs. These results suggest that mate choice evolves in response to (i) benefits in terms of parasite resistance acquired from allelic diversity, and (ii) costs associated with the disruption of co-adapted genes.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization assays were performed to detect minicircle DNA in human blood samples and triatomine feces, using probes to determine the T. cruzi clones present. T. cruzi clone 19 (TcI) resulted the most prevalent in humans, with a frequency of 0.70 compared with a frequency of 0.53 in triatomines. T. cruzi clone 39 (TcIId) was the most prevalent in T. infestans, with a frequency of 0.65 compared with 0.33 in humans. The T. cruzi clone 43 (TcIIe) was not detected in blood samples; nevertheless, it was present at a rate of 0.17 in T infestans feces. In conclusion, the T. cruzi clones are associated to each host, suggesting that selective amplification of clones occurs in human and triatomines.

   by poolscreen PCR in Mexico
AB To study the impact of mass Mectizan treatment on Onchocerca volvulus transmission in Mexico, entomological surveys were carried out in the endemic foci of Oaxaca, Southern Chiapas, and Northern Chiapas. Collected flies were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for O. volvulus parasites. The prevalence of infected and infective flies was estimated using the PoolScreen algorithm and with a novel probability-based method. O. volvulus infective larvae were not detected in flies from 6/13 communities. In 7/13 communities, infective flies were detected, with prevalences ranging from 1.6/10,000 to 29.0/10,000 and seasonal transmission potentials ranging from 0.4 to 3.3. Infected and infective flies were found in a community in Northern Chiapas, suggesting that, according to World Health Organization criteria, autochthonous transmission exists in this focus. These data suggest that O. volvulus transmission in Mexico has been suppressed or brought to a level that may be insufficient to sustain the parasite population.

AB Arboviruses from the families Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, and Bunyaviridae are suspected to cause widespread morbidity in sub-Saharan African populations, but little research been done to document the burden and distribution of these pathogens. We tested serum samples from 256 Cameroonian adults from nine rural villages for the presence of Dengue-2 (DEN-2), West Nile (WN), Yellow fever (YF), Chikungunya (CHIK), O'nyong-nyong (ONN), Sindbis (SIN), and Tahyna (TAH) infection using standard plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Of these samples, 12.5% were DEN-2 positive, 6.6% were WN positive, 26.9% were YF positive, 46.5% were CHIK seropositive, 47.7% were ONN positive, 7.8% were SIN positive, and 36.3% were TAH positive. DEN-2, YF, and CHIK seroprevalence rates were lower among individuals living in dwellings with grass or thatched roofs versus corrugated tin and in villages isolated from urban centers. Seroprevalence rates of YF and CHIK increased with age. These results suggest that inter-epidemic arboviral infection is common in central African populations.

TI Modeling hantavirus reservoir species dominance in high seroprevalence
   areas on the Azuero Peninsula of Panama
AB Habitat fragmentation commonly influences distribution of zoonotic disease reservoirs. In Panama, populations of rodent hosts of hantaviruses are favored by small habitat fragments isolated by agricultural lands. We expected a similar relationship between landscape characteristics and host distribution at fine geographical scales in southern Panama. The relative abundance of Zygodontomys brevicauda, the primary host for "Calabazo" virus, and other rodents was assessed at 24 sites within the Azuero Peninsula. We used satellite imagery to produce several spatial variables that described landscape; however, only slope was consistently related to abundances of the two most dominant rodent species. Using regression, we constructed a spatial model of areas of Z. brevicauda dominance, which in turn relates to higher infection rates. The model predicts highest abundances of Z. brevicauda in flat areas, where humans also dominate. These predictions have important ecological and conservation implications that associate diversity loss, topography, and human land use.

TI Dynamics of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in the native and introduced
   range of the host
AB In 1994, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, a common bacterial poultry pathogen, caused an epidemic in house finches in the eastern part of their North American range where the species had been introduced in the 1940s. Birds with mycoplasmal conjunctivitis were reported across the entire eastern United States within 3-4 years. Here we track the course of the Mycoplasma gallisepticum epidemic as it reached native, western North American populations of the house finch. In 2002, Mycoplasma gallisepticum was first observed in a native house finch population in Missoula, MT, where it gradually increased in prevalence during the next 2 years. Concurrently, house finches with conjunctivitis were reported with increasing number in the Pacific Northwest. In native populations of the host, the epidemic expanded more slowly, and reached lower levels of prevalence than in the eastern, introduced range of the species. Maximal prevalence was about half in the Missoula population than in local populations in the East. Although many factors can contribute to these differences, we argue that it is most likely the higher genetic heterogeneity in western than in eastern populations caused the lower impact of the pathogen.

TI Physical structure of lakes constrains epidemics in Daphnia populations
AB Parasites are integral parts of most ecosystems, yet attention has only recently focused on how community structure and abiotic factors impact host-parasite interactions. In lakes, both factors are influenced by habitat morphology. To investigate the role of habitat structure in mediating parasitism in the plankton, we quantified timing and prevalence of a common microparasite (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) in its host, Daphnia dentifera, in 18 lakes that vary in basin size and shape. Over three years, we found substantial spatial and temporal variation in the severity of epidemics. Although infection rates reached as high as 50% in some lakes, they did not occur in most lakes in most years. Host density, often considered to be a key determinant of disease spread, did not explain a significant amount of variation in the occurrence of epidemics. Furthermore, host resistance does not fully explain this parasite's distribution, since we easily infected hosts in the laboratory. Rather, basin shape predicted epidemics well; epidemics occurred only in lakes with steep-sided basins. In these lakes, the magnitude of epidemics varied with year. We suggest that biological (predation) and physical (turbulence) effects of basin shape interact with annual weather patterns to determine the regional distribution of this parasite.

TI Transmission assumptions generate conflicting predictions in host-vector
   disease models: a case study in West Nile virus
AB This review synthesizes the conflicting outbreak predictions generated by different biological assumptions in host-vector disease models. It is motivated by the North American outbreak of West Nile virus, an emerging infectious disease that has prompted at least five dynamical modelling studies. Mathematical models have long proven successful in investigating the dynamics and control of infectious disease systems. The underlying assumptions in these epidemiological models determine their mathematical structure, and therefore influence their predictions. A crucial assumption is the host-vector interaction encapsulated in the disease-transmission term, and a key prediction is the basic reproduction number, R-0. We connect these two model elements by demonstrating how the choice of transmission term qualitatively and quantitatively alters R-0 and therefore alters predicted disease dynamics and control implications. Whereas some transmission terms predict that reducing the host population will reduce disease outbreaks, others predict that this will exacerbate infection risk. These conflicting predictions are reconciled by understanding that different transmission terms apply biologically only at certain population densities, outside which they can generate erroneous predictions. For West Nile virus, R-0 estimates for six common North American bird species indicate that all would be effective outbreak hosts.

TI Host range restriction and pathogenicity in the context of influenza
   pandemic
AB Influenza A viruses cause pandemics at random intervals. Pandemics are caused by viruses that contain a hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein to which human populations are immunologically naive. Such an HA can be introduced into the human population through reassortment between human and avian virus strains or through the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus to humans. The factors that determine the interspecies transmission and pathogenicity of influenza viruses are still poorly understood; however, the HA protein plays an important role in overcoming the interspecies barrier and in virulence in avian influenza viruses. Recently, the RNA polymerase (PB2) protein has also been recognized as a critical factor in host range restriction, while the nonstructural (NS1) protein affects the initial host immune responses. We summarize current knowledge of viral factors that determine host range restriction and pathogenicity of influenza A viruses.

Cases were laboratory-confirmed patients with a Salmonella infection and controls were selected from population registries by frequency matching for age, sex, degree of urbanization and season. Cases and controls received a questionnaire on risk factors. Of the 1171 cases, 573 (49%) responded: 245 S. Enteritidis and 232 S.

TI Experimental evolution of resistance in Paramecium caudatum against the
   bacterial parasite Holospora undulata
AB Host-parasite coevolution is often described as a process of reciprocal adaptation and counter adaptation, driven by frequency-dependent selection. This requires that different parasite genotypes perform differently on different host genotypes. Such genotype-by-genotype interactions arise if adaptation to one host (or parasite) genotype reduces performance on others. These direct costs of adaptation can maintain genetic polymorphism and generate geographic patterns of local host or parasite adaptation. Fixation of all-resistant (or all-infective) genotypes is further prevented if adaptation trades off with other host (or parasite) life-history traits. For the host, such indirect costs of resistance refer to reduced fitness of resistant genotypes in the absence of parasites. We studied (co)evolution in experimental microcosms of several clones of the freshwater protozoan Paramecium caudatum, infected with the bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. After two and a half years of culture, inoculation of evolved and naive (never exposed to the parasite) hosts with evolved and founder parasites revealed an increase in host resistance, but not in parasite infectivity. A cross-infection experiment showed significant host clone-by-parasite isolate interactions, and evolved hosts tended to be more resistant to their own (local) parasites than to parasites from other hosts. Compared to naive clones, evolved host clones had lower division rates in the absence of the parasite. Thus, our study indicates de novo evolution of host resistance, associated with both direct and indirect costs. This illustrates how interactions with parasites can lead to the genetic divergence of initially identical populations.

We used a modelling approach to show the impact of resistance, expressed through different mechanisms, on selection for plant virus strains with a higher multiplication rate. Begomoviruses (Geminiviridae: Begomovirus) inducing leaf curl diseases on tomato were used as key examples.
   2. A model for the epidemiology of the plant-virus-vector system was combined with a model for the within-plant dynamics of the virus. Four types of resistance were defined, each expressing resistance through one or more model parameters. The evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) approach was used to study the effect of resistance on the evolution of within-plant virus multiplication rate.
   3. Resistance expressed through reduced virus acquisition by the vector, and resistance expressed through reduced inoculation of the plant, do not put a selection pressure on the virus to evolve towards a higher multiplication rate.
   4. Resistance expressed through reducing within-plant virus titre and symptom reducing resistance do put a selection pressure on the virus to evolve towards a higher multiplication rate.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown how to disentangle different types of plant resistance. We have also shown that each type of resistance puts a different type of selection pressure on the virus. Virologists and plant breeders can use these results to develop methods to characterize the combination of resistance mechanisms in the cultivars they breed and, on the basis of this, determine whether the cultivar will put a selection pressure on the virus to evolve more harmful types. This new approach to plant resistance against virus diseases has been made possible by combining ecological insight in virus-vector-plant interactions with ESS calculations.

TI Long-term protection against carriage of hepatitis B virus after infant
   vaccination
AB Background. Carriage of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Infant vaccination has been effective in preventing horizontal transmission during early childhood. It is unknown whether protection is maintained into early adulthood.
   Methods. In 1984, early childhood vaccination was introduced in 2 rural Gambian villages. In 2003, serological assessment of 81.5% of 1350 eligible participants 1-24 years old was done, to determine vaccine efficacy against infection and carriage.
   Results. Overall vaccine efficacy against infection and carriage was 83.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 79.8% - 86.6%) and 96.5% (85% CI, 93.9% - 98.9%), respectively. Vaccine efficacy against infection was similar when restricted to primary responders (85.3%), but a significant effect of peak antibody concentration was found. Both vaccine efficacy and levels of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) decreased with age, resulting in a vaccine efficacy against infection and carriage among 20-24-year-old participants of 70.9% ( 95% CI, 60.4% - 80.5%) and 91.1% ( 95% CI, 75.8%-100%), respectively. Fifteen years after vaccination, fewer than half of the vaccinees had detectable anti-HBs. The prevalence of carriage in the unvaccinated population was similar to the prevalence 20 years earlier.
   Conclusions. HBV vaccination early during life can provide long-lasting protection against carriage, despite decreasing antibody levels. The role played by subclinical boosting and the necessity of a booster need to be evaluated.

TI Adaptation to different human populations by HIV-1 revealed by
   codon-based analyses
AB Several codon-based methods are available for detecting adaptive evolution in protein-coding sequences, but to date none specifically identify sites that are selected differentially in two populations, although such comparisons between populations have been historically useful in identifying the action of natural selection. We have developed two fixed effects maximum likelihood methods: one for identifying codon positions showing selection patterns that persist in a population and another for detecting whether selection is operating differentially on individual codons of a gene sampled from two different populations. Applying these methods to two HIV populations infecting genetically distinct human hosts, we have found that few of the positively selected amino acid sites persist in the population; the other changes are detected only at the tips of the phylogenetic tree and appear deleterious in the long term. Additionally, we have identified seven amino acid sites in protease and reverse transcriptase that are selected differentially in the two samples, demonstrating specific population-level adaptation of HIV to human populations.

TI Efficacy of resmethrin aerosols applied from the road for suppressing
   Culex vectors of West Nile virus
AB We determined whether aerosol applications of resmethrin, delivered from the road, suppress the reproductive activity of Culex pipiens pipiens and Cx. restuans mosquitoes in suburban sites located near Boston. Oviposition implies a prior blood-feeding event and hence a potential West Nile virus (WNV) transmission-related event. Droplet size, rate of delivery and meteorological conditions were monitored. The target populations proved to be fully susceptible to the insecticide that was used. The roads in the test sites generally gave adequate opportunity for insecticidal coverage. We found that the aerosol plume may have failed to contact the target mosquitoes and conclude that such insecticidal aerosols, delivered from the road, may not effectively reduce the force of transmission of WNV in our test sites.

TI Syndromic surveillance in the Netherlands for the early detection of
   West Nile virus epidemics
AB West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that is endemic in Africa, Europe, and Eastern Asia. The recent introduction and rapid dissemination of the virus in the United States as well as an increase in WNV outbreaks in Europe, has raised concerns for its spread in Europe. A surveillance system was developed to allow timely detection of an introduction of WNV infections in The Netherlands. This program focuses on cases presenting with neurological disease and includes the monitoring of hospital discharge diagnoses, trends in cerebrospinal. fluid (CSF) diagnostic requests, laboratory testing of CSF, and monitoring of neurological disease in horses. Retrospective data from the hospital discharge records showed yearly peaks of unexplained meningitis and (meningo)encephalitis in the summer. A total of 781 CSF samples from humans and 71 serum and/or CSF samples from horses presenting with neurological disease of suspected viral etiology tested negative for the presence of specific antibodies to WNV. With a coverage rate of 59% in 2003, the probability that a cluster of five WNV cases presenting with neurological symptoms would have been detected was 99%. We conclude that, from 1999 to 2004, no evidence of WNV infection could be found in either humans or horses in The Netherlands.

TI Evaluation of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as natural
   sentinels for Anaplasma phagocytophilum
AB Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agent of human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis, can infect white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus), and this species is a crucial host for adult Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector of A. phagocytophilum. The goal of this study was to determine the geographic distribution of A. phagocytophilum among WTD across a 19 state region and to evaluate the utility of WTD as natural sentinels. Serologic testing using the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay was conducted on WTD serum samples and molecular and xenodiagnostic tests were performed to confirm serologic results. The surveillance system was assessed through examination of vital attributes including WTD age and gender associations with serologic status, sample size adequacy for accurate infection status classification, and presence of the vector, I. scapularis. Six hundred thirty-three of 2,666 (24%) WTD in 17 states tested positive for antibodies (2:128) when tested by IFA assay. Testing for p44 and/or 16S rRNA gene targets identified 73 (16%) PCR positive WTD among 458 animals tested, all of which originated from seropoisitive populations. Attempts to culture A. phagocytophilum from WTD were unsuccessful; however, xenodiagnostic mice inoculated with blood from 3 WTD became infected. Seroprevalence did not differ by deer age or gender; however, WTD <= 0.75 years old had a higher prevalence of PCR positivity. Using seroprevalence data, a sample size of 6-9 animals per population was projected to be adequate for identifying seropositive populations. The presence of I. scapularis was significantly associated with A. phagocytophilum antibodies in WTD. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that WTD would be suitable natural sentinels tot this emerging zoonotic pathogen.

TI Epidemic dynamics and antigenic evolution in a single season of
   influenza A
AB We use a mathematical model to study the evolution of influenza A during the epidemic dynamics of a single season. Classifying strains by their distance from the epidemic-originating strain, we show that neutral mutation yields a constant rate of antigenic evolution, even in the presence of epidemic dynamics. We introduce host immunity and viral immune escape to construct a non-neutral model. Our population dynamics can then be framed naturally in the context of population genetics, and we show that departure from neutrality is governed by the covariance between a strain's fitness and its distance from the original epidemic strain. We quantify the amount of antigenic evolution that takes place in excess of what is expected under neutrality and find that this excess amount is largest under strong host immunity and long epidemics.

TI Interspecific transfer of Wolbachia into the mosquito disease vector
   Aedes albopictus
AB Intracellular Wolbachia bacteria are obligate, maternally inherited endosymbionts found frequently in insects and other invertebrates. The evolutionary success of Wolbachia is due in part to an ability to manipulate reproduction. In mosquitoes and many other insects, Wolbachia causes a form of sterility known as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Wolbachia-induced CI has attracted interest as a potential agent for affecting medically important disease vectors. However, application of the approach has been restricted by an absence of appropriate, naturally occurring Wolbachia infections. Here, we report the interspecific transfer of Wolbachia infection into a medically important mosquito. Using embryonic microinjection, Wolbachia is transferred from Drosophila simulans into the invasive pest and disease vector: Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito). The resulting infection is stably maintained and displays a unique pattern of bidirectional CI in crosses with naturally infected mosquitoes. Laboratory population cage experiments examine a strategy in which releases of Wolbachia-infected males are used to suppress mosquito egg hatch. We discuss the results in relation to developing appropriate Wolbachia-infected mosquito strains for population replacement and population suppression strategies.

TI Parasites alter host phenotype and may create a new ecological niche for
   snail hosts
AB By modifying the behaviour and morphology of hosts, parasites may strongly impact host individuals, populations and communities. We examined the effects of a common trematode parasite on its snail host, Batillaria cumingi (Batillariidae). This widespread snail is usually the most abundant invertebrate in salt marshes and mudflats of the northeastern coast of Asia. More than half (52.6%, n = 1360) of the snails in our study were infected. We found that snails living in the lower intertidal zone were markedly larger and exhibited different shell morphology than those in the upper intertidal zone. The large morphotypes in the lower tidal zone were all infected by the trematode, Cercaria batillariae (Heterophyidae). We used a transplant experiment, a mark-and-recapture experiment and stable carbon isotope ratios to reveal that snails infected by the trematode move to the lower intertidal zone, resume growth after maturation and consume different resources. By simultaneously changing the morphology and behaviour of individual hosts, this parasite alters the demographics and potentially modifies resource use of the snail population. Since trematodes are common and often abundant in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the world, their effects potentially alter food webs in many systems.

TI 'Trans-generational immune priming': specific enhancement of the
   antimicrobial immune response in the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor
AB Encounters with parasites and pathogens are often unpredictable in time. However, experience of an infection may provide the host with reliable cues about the future risk of infection for the host itself or for its progeny. If the parental environment predicts the quality of the progeny's environment, then parents may further enhance their net reproductive success by differentially providing their offspring with phenotypes to cope with potential hazards such as pathogen infection. Here, I test for the occurrence of such an adaptive transgenerational phenotypic plasticity in the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor. A pathogenic environment was mimicked by injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides for two generations of insects. I found that parental challenge enhanced offspring immunity through the inducible production of antimicrobial peptides in the haemolymph.

TI Swine as a principal reservoir of hepatitis E virus that infects humans
   in eastern China
AB Background and methods. Genotype IV hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been isolated from humans and swine. To study the relationship between the human and swine reservoirs, we estimated their respective viral burden, analyzed the genetic makeup of the virus populations, and assessed the risk of infection associated with swine farming.
   Results. In 2 swine-farming districts of eastern China, 9.6% of swine and 0.3% of healthy human subjects excreted HEV in stool, as did 68.8% of patients with confirmed HEV infection. The virus population circulating in humans consisted of genotype I and at least 4 phylogenetically distinct subgroups of genotype IV viruses, 2 of which concurrently circulated among swine. Persons engaged in occupations related to swine farming were found to have a 74% higher risk of infection than those engaged in other occupations, and persons living in communities downstream of the swine farms were found to have a 29% higher risk of infection than persons living in communities upstream.
   Conclusions. Genotype IV HEV is freely transmitted between humans and swine. Because the size of the swine population and its viral burden are much larger than those of humans, transmission of the virus most likely is directed from swine to humans. Infection can be acquired through contact with swine and their waste.

TI Wolbachia infection reduces sperm competitive ability in an insect
AB The maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia pipientis imposes significant fitness costs on its hosts. One such cost is decreased sperm production resulting in reduced fertility of male Drosophila simulans infected with cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) inducing Wolbachia. We tested the hypothesis that Wolbachia infection affects sperm competitive ability and found that Wolbachia infection is indeed associated with reduced success in sperm competition in non-virgin males. In the second male role, infected males sired 71% of the offspring whereas uninfected males sired 82% of offspring. This is the first empirical evidence indicating that Wolbachia infection deleteriously affects sperm competition and raises the possibility that polyandrous females can utilize differential sperm competitive ability to bias the paternity of broods and avoid the selfish manipulations of Wolbachia. This suggests a relationship between Wolbachia infection and host reproductive strategies. These findings also have important consequences for Wolbachia population dynamics because the transmission advantage of Wolbachia is likely to be undermined by sperm competition.

TI Environmental influence on the genetic basis of mosquito resistance to
   malaria parasites
AB The genetic basis of a host's resistance to parasites has important epidemiological and evolutionary consequences. Understanding this genetic basis can be complicated by non-genetic factors, such as environmental quality, which may influence the expression of genetic resistance and profoundly alter patterns of disease and the host's response to selection. In particular, understanding the environmental influence on the genetic resistance of mosquitoes to malaria gives valuable knowledge concerning the use of malaria-resistant transgenic mosquitoes as a measure of malaria control. We made a step towards this understanding by challenging eight isofemale lines of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi with the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii yoelii and by feeding the mosquitoes with different concentrations of glucose. The isofemale lines differed in infection loads (the numbers of oocysts), corroborating earlier studies showing a genetic basis of resistance. In contrast, the proportion of infected mosquitoes did not differ among lines, suggesting that the genetic component underlying infection load differs from the genetic component underlying infection rate. In addition, the mean infection load and, in particular, its heritable variation in mosquitoes depended on the concentration of glucose, which suggests that the environment affects the expression and the evolution of the mosquitoes' resistance in nature. We found no evidence of genotype-by-environment interactions, i.e. the lines responded similarly to environmental variation. Overall, these results indicate that environmental variation can significantly reduce the importance of genes in determining the resistance of mosquitoes to malaria infection.

TI Geographic potential for outbreaks of Marburg hemorrhagic fever
AB Marburg virus represents one of the least well-known of the hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses worldwide; in particular, its geographic potential in Africa remains quite mysterious. Ecologic niche modeling was used to explore the geographic and ecologic potential of Marburg virus in Africa. Model results permitted a reinterpretation of the geographic point of infection in the initiation of the 1975 cases in Zimbabwe, and also anticipated the potential for cases in Angola, where a large outbreak recently (2004-2005) occurred. The geographic potential for additional outbreaks is outlined, including in several countries in which the virus is not known. Overall, results demonstrate that ecologic niche modeling can be a powerful tool in understanding geographic distributions of species and other biologic phenomena such as zoonotic disease transmission from natural reservoir populations.

TI Urban malaria in dakar, Senegal: Chemosusceptibility and genetic
   diversity of Plasmodium falciparum isolates
AB The chemosusceptibility and genetic polymorphism of Plasmodium falciparum populations from 48 patients hospitalized for malaria at the Hospital Principal in Dakar, Senegal were investigated during the 2002 malaria transmission season. Sixty-two percent of the isolates collected were from patients with severe malaria and 38% were from patients with mild malaria. In vitro activities of chloroquine, quinine, cycloguanil, atovaquone, mefloquine, halofantrine, and artesunate were evaluated. The prevalence of mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihyropteroate synthetase (dhps) genes and the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene associated with cycloguanil, pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine, and chloroquine resistance were estimated. The genetic polymorphism of the parasite populations was evaluated by analysis of the highly polymorphic regions of merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) block 2 and msp2. Seventy percent of the isolates were assessed by an in vitro assay. Fifty-two percent of the isolates were chloroquine resistant, 45% were cycloguanil resistant, and 24% were atovaquone resistant. Four percent had low susceptibility to quinine. The Pfcrt and dhfr mutations were associated with in vitro chloroquine- and antimetabolic drug-resistant isolates, respectively. Approximately 70% of the isolates contained two or more clones. Genetic diversity of P. falciparum was high. The prevalence of allelic family K1 of msp1 was 68%. Isolates of P. falciparum were highly resistant to chloroquine, cycloguanil and atovaquone. The transmission rate of malaria in Dakar is low but a high degree of genetic polymorphism can increase severe malaria, as shown by persons coming to Dakar from areas highly endemic for malaria. Areas with urban malaria should use vector control measures and efficient chemoprophylaxis for non-immune populations.

TI The role of immune-mediated apparent competition in genetically diverse
   malaria infections
AB Competitive interactions between coinfecting genotypes of the same pathogen can impose selection on virulence, but the direction of this selection depends on the mechanisms behind the interactions. Here, we investigate how host immune responses contribute to competition between clones in mixed infections of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi. We studied single and mixed infections of a virulent and an avirulent clone and compared the extent of competition in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice (nude mice and T cell-reconstituted nude mice, respectively). In immunocompetent mice, the avirulent clone suffered more from competition than did the virulent clone. The competitive suppression of the avirulent clone was alleviated in immunodeficient mice. Moreover, the relative density of the avirulent clone in mixed infections was higher in immunodeficient than in immunocompetent mice. We conclude that immune-mediated interactions contributed to competitive suppression of the avirulent clone, although other mechanisms, presumably competition for resources such as red blood cells, must also be important. Because only the avirulent clone suffered from immune-mediated competition, this mechanism should contribute to selection for increased virulence in mixed infections in this host-parasite system. As far as we are aware, this is the first direct experimental evidence of immune-mediated apparent competition in any host-parasite system.

TI Pathogen relatedness affects the prevalence of within-host competition
AB Although the evolutionary consequences of within-host competition among pathogens have been examined extensively, there exists a critical gap in our understanding of factors determining the prevalence of multiple infections. Here we examine the effects of relatedness among strains of the anther-smut pathogen Microbotryum violaceum on the probability of multiple infection in its host, Silene latifolia, after sequential inoculations. We found a significantly higher probability of multiple infection when interacting strains were more closely related, suggesting mechanisms of competitive exclusion that are conditional on genotypic characteristics of the strains involved. Pathogen relatedness therefore determines the prevalence of multiple infection in addition to its outcome, with important consequences for our understanding of virulence evolution and pathogen population structure and diversity.

TI Warmer does not have to mean sicker: Temperature and predators can
   jointly drive timing of epidemics
AB Ecologists and epidemiologists worry that global warming will increase disease prevalence. These fears arise because several direct and indirect mechanisms link warming to disease, and because parasite outbreaks are increasing in many taxa. However, this outcome is not a foregone conclusion, as physiological and community-interaction-based mechanisms may inhibit epidemics at warmer temperatures. Here, we explore this thermal-cormmunity-ecology-based mechanism, centering on fish predators that selectively prey upon Daphnia infected with a fungal parasite. We used an interplay between a simple model built around this system's biology and laboratory experiments designed to parameterize the model. Through this data-model interaction, we found that a given density of predators can inhibit epidemics as temperatures rise when thermal physiology of the predator scales more steeply than that of the host. This case is met in our fish-Daphnia-fungus system. Furthermore, the combination of steeply scaling parasite physiology and predation-induced mortality can inhibit epidemics at lower temperatures. This effect may terminate fungal epidemics of Daphnia as lakes cool in autumn. Thus, predation and physiology could constrain epidemics to intermediate temperatures (a pattern that we see in our system). More generally, these results accentuate the possibility that warmer temperatures might actually enhance predator control of parasites.

TI Ecological fitting as a determinant of the community structure of
   platyhelminth parasites of anurans
AB Host-parasite associations are assumed to be ecologically specialized, tightly coevolved systems driven by mutual modification in which host switching is a rare phenomenon. Ecological fitting, however, increases the probability of host switching, creating incongruences between host and parasite phylogenies, when (1) specialization on a particular host resource is a shared characteristic of distantly related parasites, and (2), the resource being tracked by the parasite is widespread among many host species. We investigated the effect of ecological fitting on structuring the platyhelminth communities of anurans from a temperate forest and grassland in the United States and tropical dry and wet forests in Mexico and Costa Rica. The six communities all exhibit similar structure in terms of the genera and families inhabiting the frogs. Parasite species richness is highly correlated with the amount of time a host spends in association with aquatic habitats, a conservative aspect of both parasite and host natural history, and determined in a proximal sense by host mobility and diet breadth. The pattern of parasite. genera and families within host genera across the regions examined is consistent with the prediction that ecological fitting by phylogenetically conservative species, coupled with historical accidents of speciation and dispersal, should be evidenced as a nested-subset structure; the shared requirement for aquatic habitats of tadpoles provides a baseline assemblage to which other parasite taxa are added as a function of adult host association with aquatic habitats. We conclude that parasite communities are structured by both ecological fitting and coevolution (mutual modification), the relative influences of which are expected to vary among different communities and associations.

TI Multilocus genetics and the coevolution of quantitative traits
AB We develop and analyze an explicit multilocus genetic model of coevolution. We assume that interactions between two species (mutualists, competitors, or victim and exploiter) are mediated by a pair of additive quantitative traits that are also subject to direct stabilizing selection toward intermediate optima. Using a weak-selection approximation, we derive analytical results for a symmetric case with equal locus effects and no mutation, and we complement these results by numerical simulations of more general cases. We show that mutualistic and competitive interactions always result in coevolution toward a stable equilibrium with no more than one polymorphic locus per species. Victim-exploiter interactions can lead to different dynamic regimes including evolution toward stable equilibria, cycles, and chaos. At equilibrium, the victim is often characterized by a very large genetic variance, whereas the exploiter is polymorphic in no more than one locus. Compared to related one-locus or quantitative genetic models, the multilocus model exhibits two major new properties. First, the equilibrium structure is considerably more complex. We derive detailed conditions for the existence and stability of various classes of equilibria and demonstrate the possibility of multiple simultaneously stable states. Second, the genetic variances change dynamically, which in turn significantly affects the dynamics of the mean trait values. In particular, the dynamics tend to be destabilized by an increase in the number of loci.

TI Within-host competition in genetically diverse malaria infections:
   Parasite virulence and competitive success
AB Humans and animals often become coinfected with pathogen strains that differ in virulence. The ensuing interaction between these strains can, in theory, be a major determinant of the direction of selection on virulence genes in pathogen populations. Many mathematical analyses of this assume that virulent pathogen lineages have a competitive advantage within coinfected hosts and thus predict that pathogens will evolve to become more virulent where genetically diverse infections are common. Although the implications of these studies are relevant to both fundamental biology and medical science, direct empirical tests for relationships between virulence and competitive ability are lacking. Here we use newly developed strain-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocols to determine the pairwise competitiveness of genetically divergent Plasmodium chabaudi clones that represent a wide range of innate virulences in their rodent host. We found that even against their background of widely varying genotypic and antigenic properties, virulent clones had a competitive advantage in the acute phase of mixed infections. The more virulent a clone was relative to its competitor, the less it suffered from competition. This result confirms our earlier work with parasite lines derived from a single clonal lineage by serial passage and supports the virulence-competitive ability assumption of many theoretical models. To the extent that our rodent model captures the essence of the natural history of malaria parasites, public health interventions which reduce the incidence of mixed malaria infections should have beneficial consequences by reducing the selection for high virulence.

TI Parasite-mediated selection and the role of sex and diapause in Daphnia
AB To gain insight into parasite-mediated natural selection, we studied a natural population of the crustacean Daphnia magna during a severe epidemic of the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. We also investigated the relationship between susceptibility and the production of resting eggs, which are only produced during the sexual phase of reproduction. Live host samples were taken before and after this epidemic and resistance to P. ramosa was examined in the laboratory. Host clones collected after the epidemic were more resistant to P. ramosa than were those collected pre-epidemic, which is consistent with parasite-mediated selection. in our study population, asexually reproducing females were observed across the entire study period, but females carrying resting eggs were observed only prior to the epidemic. For hosts isolated in this pre-epidemic period, we found evidence that those carrying resting eggs (at the time of collection) were more susceptible than those that were reproducing asexually. This was especially apparent for measures of parasite growth, although not all measures of infection success conclusively supported this pattern. Nevertheless, the data suggest that some genotypes invest heavily in diapause at the expense of immunocompetence. Sex could therefore inhibit the evolution of resistance because each spring new genotypes will hatch from resting eggs that are relatively susceptible as they were not exposed to the previous years bout of parasite-mediated selection.

TI Genetic analysis of circulating and sequestered populations of
   Plasmodium falciparum in fatal pediatric malaria
AB Falciparum malaria is characterized by cytoadherence of host erythrocytes containing mature asexual-stage parasites and the consequent sequestration of these forms in tissue microvasculature. A postmortem study of pediatric malaria provided us with the opportunity to compare the genetic complexity of circulating and sequestered Plasmodium falciparum populations, in patients with fatal cerebral malaria ( CM) versus control subjects with incidental P. falciparum parasitemia who died of causes other than malaria. Parasite genotypes identified in peripheral blood collected at the time of admission to the hospital constituted a subset of those detected in the tissues at death. Despite a higher tissue burden of parasitized erythrocytes in patients with CM than in parasitemic control subjects, parasite populations in tissues from patients with CM were less genetically complex, and the genotypes were more homogeneously distributed throughout the body, than in patients with incidental infection. Our findings support the notion that CM is associated with the emergence of a small number of dominant genotypes in an infected individual.

TI Parasites shape the optimal investment in immunity
AB The evolution of optimal functioning and maintenance of the immune system is thought to be driven by the costs arising from the allocation of resources to immune functions rather than to growth and reproduction and by the benefits arising from higher defence if an infection occurs. In young animals there is a high premium for fast growth and competitiveness and a parasite-mediated trade-off is thus predicted between the allocation of resources to growth versus immune function. In a field study on nestling great tits (Parus major), we manipulated simultaneously the level of immune defence by a dietary supplementation of the immunostimulant methionine and ectoparasite (Ceratophyllus gallinae) abundance in the nest and thereby assessed both the costs and benefits of investing in immune defence. Nestlings supplemented with methionine grew slower during the experimental boost of their immune system compared to controls. Thereafter, however, nestlings with a boosted immune system grew at faster rates under parasite pressure compared to unstimulated birds. It experimentally shows the costs and benefits of investment in immunity and suggests that the evolution of optimum host defence is governed by a parasite-mediated allocation trade-off between growth and immune function.

TI Host mating system and the prevalence of disease in a plant population
AB A modified susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) host-pathogen model is used to determine the influence of plant mating system on the outcome of a host-pathogen interaction. Unlike previous models describing how interactions between mating system and pathogen infection affect individual fitness, this model considers the potential consequences of varying mating systems on the prevalence of resistance alleles and disease within the population. If a single allele for disease resistance is sufficient to confer complete resistance in an individual and if both homozygote and heterozygote resistant individuals have the same mean birth and death rates, then, for any parameter set, the selfing rate does not affect the proportions of resistant, susceptible or infected individuals at equilibrium. If homozygote and heterozygote individual birth rates differ, however, the mating system can make a difference in these proportions. In that case, depending on other parameters, increased selfing can either increase or decrease the rate of infection in the population. Results from this model also predict higher frequencies of resistance alleles in predominantly selfing compared to predominantly outcrossing populations for most model conditions. In populations that have higher selfing rates, the resistance alleles are concentrated in homozygotes, whereas in more outcrossing populations, there are more resistant heterozygotes.

TI Bacteriophage-mediated competition in Bordetella bacteria
AB Apparent competition between species is believed to be one of the principal driving forces that structure ecological communities, although the precise mechanisms have yet to be characterized. Here we develop a model system that isolates phage-mediated interactions by neutralizing resource competition with a large excess of nutrients, and consists of two genetically identical Bordetella strains that differ only in that one is the carrier of phage and the other is susceptible to the phage. We observe and quantify the competitive advantage of the bacterial strain bearing the prophage in both invading and in resisting invasion by the bacterial strain sensitive to the phage, and use our experimental measurements to develop a mathematical model of phage-mediated competition. The model predicts, and experimental evidence confirms, that the competitive advantage conferred by the lysogenic phage depends only on the phage pathology on the sensitive bacterial strain and is independent of other phage and host parameters, such as the infection-causing contact rate, the spontaneous and infection-induced lysis rates and the phage burst size. This work combines experimental and mathematical approaches to the study of phage-driven competition, and provides an experimentally tested framework for evaluation of the effects of pathogens/parasites on interspecific competition.

The project has developed models of the within-host dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum that have been fitted to parasite density profiles from malariatherapy patients, and simulations of P. falciparum epidemiology fitted to field malariologic datasets from a large ensemble of settings across Africa. The models provide a unique platform for predicting both the short- and long-term effects of malaria vaccines on the burden of disease, allowing for the temporal dynamics of effects on immunity and transmission. We discuss how the models can be used to obtain robust cost-effectiveness estimates for a wide range of malaria vaccines and vaccination delivery strategies in different eco-epidemiologic settings. This paper outlines for a non-mathematical audience the approach we have taken and its underlying rationale.

TI Relationships between host infectivity to mosquitoes and asexual
   parasite density in Plasmodium falciparum
AB We describe a statistical model for the relationship between asexual parasite densities of Plasmodium falciparum and the infectivity of the host to mosquitoes. The model takes into account the delay between asexual parasitemia and infectivity resulting from the time course of gametocytemia. It also allows for the need for the blood meal to contain gametocytes of both sexes if infection is to take place. We show that by fitting this model to data from malariatherapy patients it can explain observed patterns of infectiousness of the human host and is consistent with distributions of gametocyte densities in malariatherapy patients. By integrating this model into an individual-based simulation of human populations exposed to endemic P. falciparum transmission, we are able to predict the contributions of different host age groups to the infectious reservoir. Comparison of model predictions with published estimates of this quantity confirms that infected adults hosts are likely to make a significant contribution to the reservoir of transmission, and points to the need for improved population-based estimates of this age-dependence in infectivity of humans in endemic areas.

TI Rapid assay to identify the two genetic forms of Culex (Culex) pipiens
   L. (Diptera : Culicidae) and hybrid populations
AB A previously developed method to identify members of the Culex pipiens complex exploiting polymorphisms in a nuclear intron (acetyleholinesterase [ACE] based-assay) cannot differentiate the two forms of Cx. pipiens: form pipiens and form molestus. Notably, the two forms seem to differ extensively in behavior and physiology and likely have very different epidemiologic importance. Because they are morphologically indistinguishable, molecular methods are critical for the evaluation of their relative importance. Although the two forms of Cx. pipiens have been distinguished using a panel of microsatellite loci, such a protocol is laborious and expensive. We developed a rapid assay based on polymorphisms in the flanking region of a microsatellite locus. Used in conjunction with the ACE-assay, this new assay allows the identification of pure and hybrid populations of the two Cx. pipiens forms as well as those including Cx. quinquefasciatus. We discuss the usefulness of the method as well as limitations to its application.

TI Does the roosting behavior of birds affect transmission dynamics of West
   Nile virus?
AB The potential role of many urban passerine birds in the transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) is well-documented by studies on host competency, seroprevalence in wild birds, and identification of vector blood meal source. In contrast, the impact of bird behavior on transmission dynamics is largely unexplored. Bird roosting (perching) behavior may be a critical component regulating WNV transmission because of the crepuscular/nocturnal feeding behavior of Culex mosquitoes, the primary vectors of WNV. We used radio telemetry to determine the roosting behavior of American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and northern cardinals (Cardinalus cardinalus). On average, healthy crows moved slightly shorter distances between roosts than viremic crows, 1,038.3 meters versus 1,255.5 meters, while cardinals only moved 54.7 meters. Given the average movements of crows and cardinals between roosts, crows, which are viremic for five days, could spread the virus throughout a mean SE area of 20.84 +/- 0.79 km(2), while viremic cardinals would, on average, only spread the virus over a mean SE area of 0.03 +/- 0.01 km(2). Because the crow population in Illinois is decreasing at a rate of 11.5% per year and up to 35.6% per year in certain locations, crows are becoming scarce in some areas, thus reducing their role as wild bird sentinels. We suggest that if crows are important in dispersing WNV, large decreases in their abundance will shift transmission cycles to a more focal nature because of the differences in roosting behavior of crows compared with other urban birds, such as cardinals.

TI Road facilitation of trematode infections in snails of northern Alaska
AB Road disturbances can influence wildlife health by spreading disease agents and hosts or by generating environmental conditions that sustain these agent and host populations. I evaluated field patterns of trematode infections in snails inhabiting ponds at varying distances from the Dalton Highway, a wilderness road that intersects northern Alaska. I also assessed the relationships between trematode infections and snail densities and six environmental variables: calcium concentration, aquatic vegetative cover, canopy cover, temperature, pond size, and community structure. Presence of trematode infections and snail density were negatively correlated with distance from the highway. Of the pond characteristics measured, only calcium concentration and vegetation density declined with distance from road. However, neither variable was positively associated with snail density or trematode presence. One potential explanation for observed patterns is that vehicles, road maintenance, or vertebrate vectors attracted to the highway facilitate colonization of snails or trematodes. Emerging disease threats to biological diversity in northern ecosystems highlight the importance of understanding how roads affect disease transmission.

TI Localized deer absence leads to tick amplification
AB Deer support high tick intensities, perpetuating tick populations, but they do not support tick-borne pathogen transmission, so are dilution hosts. We test the hypothesis that absence of deer (loss of a dilution host) will result in either an increase or a reduction in tick density, and that the outcome is scale dependent. We use a complementary methodological approach starting with meta-analysis, followed up by a field experiment. Meta-analysis indicated that larger deer exclosures reduce questing (host-seeking) tick density, but as the exclosure becomes smaller (< 2.5 ha) the questing tick density is increased (amplified). To determine the consequences for tick-borne pathogen transmission we carried out a field experiment, comparing the intensity of ticks that fed on hosts competent for tick-borne pathogen transmission (rodents) in two small (< 1 ha) deer exclosures and their replicated controls. Intensity of larval ticks on rodents was not significantly different between treatments, but nymph intensity, the tick stage responsible for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) transmission, was higher in deer exclosures. TBE seropositive rodents were found in a deer exclosure but not in the controls. We propose that localized absence of deer (loss of a dilution host) increases tick feeding on rodents, leading to the potential for tick-borne disease hotspots.

TI The evolution of virulence and host specialization in malaria parasites
   of primates
AB Parasite virulence, i.e. the damage done to the host, may be a by-product of the parasite's effort to maximize its fitness. Accordingly, several life-history trade-offs may explain interspecific differences in virulence, but such constraints remain little tested in an evolutionary context. In this phylogenetic study of primate malarias, I investigated the relationship between virulence and other parasite life-history traits. I used peak parasitaemia as a proxy for virulence, because it reflected parasite reproductive success and parasite-induced mortality. Peak parasitaemia was higher in specialist than in generalist species, even when confounding life-history traits were controlled. While there was a significant phylogenetic relationship between the number of competitors per host and host specialization, peak parasitaemia was unrelated to within-host competition. Therefore, the key evolutionary factor that favours virulence is host specialization, and the evolutionary success of virulent parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum, may be better understood when the trade-off in virulence between different hosts is considered. Such phylogenetic results may help us design better protection programmes against malaria.

TI Bat-transmitted human rabies outbreaks, Brazilian Amazon
AB We describe 2 bat-transmitted outbreaks in remote, rural areas of Portel and Viseu Municipalities, Para State, northern Brazil. Central nervous system specimens were taken after patients' deaths and underwent immunofluorescent assay and histopathologic examination for rabies antigens; also, specimens were injected intracerebrally into suckling mice in an attempt to isolate the virus. Strains obtained were antigenically and genetically characterized. Twenty-one persons died due to paralytic rabies in the 2 municipalities. Ten rabies virus strains were isolated from human specimens; 2 other cases were diagnosed by histopathologic examination. Isolates were antigenically characterized as Desmodus rotundus variant 3 (AgV3). DNA sequencing of 6 strains showed that they were genetically close to D. rotundus-related strains isolated in Brazil. The genetic results were similar to those obtained by using monoclonal antibodies and support the conclusion that the isolates studied belong to the same rabies cycle, the virus variants found in the vampire bat D. rotundus.

TI Variation in resistance and virulence in the interaction between
   Arabidopsis thaliana and a bacterial pathogen
AB We examined patterns of variation and the extent of local adaptation in the interaction between the highly selfing annual weed Arabidopsis thaliana and its foliar bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas viridiflava by cross-infecting 23 bacterial isolates with 35 plant lines collected from six fallow or cultivated fields in the Midwest, USA. We used two measures of resistance and virulence: bacterial count in the leaf and symptom development four days after infection. We found variation in resistance in A. thaliana and virulence in P. viridiflava, as well as a significant difference in symptoms between two distinct genetic clades within P. viridiflava. We also observed that both resistance and plant development rate varied with field type of origin (cultivated or fallow), possibly through age-related resistance, a developmentally regulated general form of resistance. Finally, we did not observe local adaptation by host or pathogen, rather we found patterns of variation across populations that depended in part on P. viridiflava clade. These data suggest that the interaction between A. thaliana and P. viridiflava varies across space and is mediated by the selection regime of the host populations and differential performance of the P. viridiflava clades. This is one of a very limited number of studies examining a bacterial pathogen of wild plant populations and one of a few studies to examine patterns of variation in a plant-pathogen association that is not a highly specialized gene-for-gene interaction.

TI The impact of variable hatching rates on parasite control: a model of an
   aquatic ectoparasite in a Finnish fish farm
AB 1. Many parasites of medical and veterinary importance infect via free-living stages that undergo a period of development in the environment before seeking a host. Frequently, considerable variation is observed in the development rates of these stages, such that some individuals may be considered to occupy distinct subpopulations, similar to a plant's seed bank. Under certain conditions, these subpopulations may act as a reservoir for the parasite, buffering it from the impact of management strategies and reducing control success.
   2. We assessed the impact of intraspecific variation in development rates on parasite control by developing a population dynamic model of the ectoparasite Argulus coregoni, a major parasite of Finnish fish farms. We divided argulid eggs into two subpopulations: an exposed class with fast hatching rates and an 'egg bank' with slower hatching rates. We then assessed the success of a number of potential control strategies under a range of egg bank hatching regimes.
   3. The predicted seasonal dynamics of the various life-cycle stages matched well those observed in Finnish fish farms. Simulations showed that the long-term growth rate of the argulid population tends to be reduced by the presence of a slow-hatching egg bank, unless the egg bank affords some protection in the form of reduced egg mortality.
   4. Sensitivity analysis showed that the key stages of the parasite's life cycle are those that relate to the on-fish juvenile mortality and development rates. The next most sensitive parameters relate to the number of viable eggs at the start of the year, such as female fecundity and overwinter egg survival. We showed that current control approaches that target these stages could prove highly effective at suppressing the argulid population. However, long-term control was greatly reduced in both cases as the proportion of eggs entering the egg bank increased. This was especially true if mortality of the egg bank was lower than that of the exposed eggs.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Understanding the factors affecting parasite persistence is vital for the development of effective long-term control. We have shown that inherent heterogeneity within a parasite population may have a substantial impact on its long-term growth rate, and can be an important mechanism reducing the effectiveness of targeted control strategies in the field.

TI Containing HIV/AIDS in India: the unfinished agenda
AB India's HIV epidemic is not yet contained and prevention in populations most at risk (high-risk groups) needs to be enhanced and expanded. HIV prevalence as measured through surveillance of antenatal and sexually transmitted disease clinics is the chief source of information on HIV in India, but these data cannot provide real insight into where transmission is occurring or guide programme strategy. The factors that influence the Indian epidemic are the size, behaviours, and disease burdens of high-risk groups, their interaction with bridge populations and general population sexual networks, and migration and mobility of both bridge populations and high-risk groups. The interplay of these forces has resulted in substantial epidemics in several pockets of many Indian states that could potentially ignite subepidemics in other, currently low prevalence, parts of the country. The growth of HIV, unless contained, could have serious consequences for India's development. India's national response to HIV began in 1992 and has shown early success in some states. The priority is to build on those successes by increasing prevention coverage of high-risk groups to saturation level, enhancing access and uptake of care and treatment services, ensuring systems and capacity for evidence-based programming, and building in-country technical and managerial capacity.

TI Bacteriophage WO-B and Wolbachia in natural mosquito hosts: infection
   incidence, transmission mode and relative density
AB Bacteriophages of Wolbachia bacteria have been proposed as a potential transformation tool for genetically modifying mosquito vectors. In this study, we report the presence of the WO-B class of Wolbachia-associated phages among natural populations of several mosquito hosts. Eighty-eight percent (22/25) of Wolbachia-infected mosquito species surveyed were found to contain WO-B phages. WO-B phage orf7 sequence analysis suggested that a single strain of WO-B phage was found in most singly (23/24) or doubly (1/1) Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. However, the single Wolbachia strain infecting Aedes perplexus was found to harbour at least two different WO-B phages. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that horizontal transmission of WO-B phages has occurred on an evolutionary scale between the Wolbachia residing in mosquitoes. On an ecological scale, a low trend of co-transmission occurred among specific WO-B phages within Wolbachia of each mosquito species. Assessment of the density of WO-B phage by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTQ-PCR) revealed an average relative density of 7.76 x 10(5) +/- 1.61 x 10(5) orf7 copies per individual mosquito for a single Wolbachia strain infecting mosquitoes, but a threefold higher density in the doubly Wolbachia-infected Aedes albopictus. However, the average combined density of WO-B phage(s) did not correlate with that of their Wolbachia hosts, which varied in different mosquito species. We also confirmed the presence of WO-B-like virus particles in the laboratory colony of Ae. albopictus (KLPP) morphologically, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The viral-like particles were detected after purification and filtration of Ae. albopictus ovary extract, suggesting that at least one WO-B-like phage is active (temperate) within the Wolbachia of this mosquito vector. Nevertheless, the idea of utilizing these bacteriophages as transformation vectors still needs more investigation and is likely to be unfeasible.

TI The coexistence of hybrid and parental Daphnia: the role of parasites
AB Parasite driven time-lagged negative frequency-dependent selection of hosts has been studied in natural populations by following changes in host genotype frequencies over time. However, such dynamics have not been considered at higher taxonomic levels, for example, between parental species and their hybrids. In a field study on a Daphnia hybrid system, we observed that one Daphnia taxon first was relatively under-infected, but became over-infected after a strong increase in frequency. This finding is consistent with the idea of parasite evolution towards the most frequent host taxon. In two experiments, we investigated whether the assumptions made by a model of negative frequency-dependent selection apply to our host taxa system. First, we showed that the parasite can change the outcome of taxa competition and secondly, we confirmed that the over-infection of one host taxon observed in the field has a genetic basis. Our results indicate that the incorporation of host-parasite interactions at the species level may allow us to gain a more complete picture of forces driving dynamic taxa coexistence in Daphnia hybrid systems. More generally, we suggest that if hybrids coexist in sympatry with parental taxa, the infection patterns as observed under natural conditions may be rather temporal and unstable.

TI Harvesting can increase severity of wildlife disease epidemics
AB Theoretical studies of wildlife population dynamics have proved insightful for sustainable management, where the principal aim is to maximize short-term yield, without risking population extinction. Surprisingly, infectious diseases have not been accounted for in harvest models, which is a major oversight because the consequences of parasites for host population dynamics are well-established. Here, we present a simple general model for a host species subject to density dependent reproduction and seasonal demography. We assume this host species is subject to infection by a strongly immunizing, directly transmitted pathogen. In this context, we show that the interaction between density dependent effects and harvesting can substantially increase both disease prevalence and the absolute number of infectious individuals. This effect clearly increases the risk of cross-species disease transmission into domestic and livestock populations. In addition, if the disease is associated with a risk of mortality, then the synergistic interaction between hunting and disease-induced death can increase the probability of host population extinction.

TI Pathogen responses to host immunity: the impact of time delays and
   memory on the evolution of virulence
AB Current analytical models of the mammalian immune system typically assume a specialist predator-prey relationship between invading pathogens and the active components of the immune response. However, in reality, the specific immune system is not immediately effective following invasion by a novel pathogen. First, there may be an explicit time delay between infection and immune initiation and, second, there may be a gradual build-up in immune efficacy (for instance, during the period of B-cell affinity maturation) during which the immune response develops, before reaching maximal specificity to the pathogen. Here, we use a novel theoretical approach to show that these processes, together with the presence of long-lived immune memory, decouple the immune response from current pathogen levels, greatly changing the dynamics of the pathogen-immune system interaction and the ability of the immune response to eliminate the pathogen. Furthermore, we use this model to show how distributed primary immune responses combine with immune memory to greatly affect the optimal virulence of the pathogen, potentially resulting in the evolution of highly virulent pathogens.

TI HDV genotypes in the Western Brazilian Amazon region: A preliminary
   report
AB In Brazil, hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is only reported in Western Amazonia, where severe cases of acute and chronic HDV hepatitis have been described. The study area was chosen in the States of Acre and Rondonia where most cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HDV are reported. From December 2003 to October 2004, 40 HBsAg carriers with anti-HDV IgM were selected. An epidemiologic questionnaire, including demographic and clinical/epidemiologic variables was filled out. HDV amplification and genotyping were performed. Genotype I was detected in 22 patients (55.0%), whereas genotype III was identified in 18 (45.0%). Patients who were infected with genotype I were older (45.1 +/- 17.8 years) than patients infected with genotype 111 (32.8 +/- 10.9 years; P = 0.01). No symptoms were reported by 21 (52.5%) patients. Otherwise, 19 (47.5%) had symptoms (fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, and decompensated liver disease) that motivated them to seek medical care. Genotype III carriers were more symptomatic, but no statistical significance was achieved. Our preliminary results show that HDV genotypes I and III are present in Brazilian Amazonia and that HDV genotype III is not limited to the Amerindian population.

TI Host life-history strategy explains pathogen-induced sterility
AB Virulence is often equated with pathogen-induced mortality, even though loss of fecundity is also common. But while the former may be understood as a simple consequence of lost host resources for the purposes of pathogen transmission, pathogen-induced sterility is often not associated with changes in host mortality. As a result, a separate literature has emerged to explain fecundity effects of parasitism that has not been integrated into general theories of the evolution of virulence. Here, I present a model of pathogen-induced sterility that is based on the assumption that hosts and pathogens vie for the same host resources for both reproduction and maintenance. Loss of host fecundity can then be explained by the host compensating for its future loss of resources, before infection. Such preinfection "fecundity compensation" may often cause preinfection investment in maintenance to be as low as postinfection levels, despite a loss of total host resources after infection. Thus, sterility is simply explained as a host life-history strategy in a system where the pathogen necessarily steals host resources for its own transmission. In certain circumstances, the pathogen may even be able to manipulate the host to redirect resources away from reproduction and toward maintenance through castration, causing gigantism.

TI A gravity model for the spread of a pollinator-borne plant pathogen
AB Many pathogens of plants are transmitted by arthropod vectors whose movement between individual hosts is influenced by foraging behavior. Insect foraging has been shown to depend on both the quality of hosts and the distances between hosts. Given the spatial distribution of host plants and individual variation in quality, vector foraging patterns may therefore produce predictable variation in exposure to pathogens. We develop a "gravity" model to describe the spatial spread of a vector-borne plant pathogen from underlying models of insect foraging in response to host quality using the pollinator-borne smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum as a case study. We fit the model to spatially explicit time series of M. violaceum transmission in replicate experimental plots of the white campion Silene latifolia. The gravity model provides a better fit than a mean field model or a model with only distance-dependent transmission. The results highlight the importance of active vector foraging in generating spatial patterns of disease incidence and for pathogen-mediated selection for floral traits.

TI Food webs and disease: Is pathogen diversity limited by vector
   diversity?
AB Classical predator-prey and host-parasite systems have been extensively studied in a food web context. Less attention has been paid to communities that include pathogens and their vectors. We present a coarse-grained, pan-African analysis of the relationships between the abiotic environment (location, precipitation, temperature), the species richness and community composition of ixodid ticks, and the species richness and community composition of pathogens that ticks transmit to humans. We found strong correlations between the abiotic environment and tick species richness, and a weak but significant correlation between the abiotic environment and pathogen species richness. A substantial amount of variation in community composition of parasites and pathogens was not explained by the variables that we considered. A structural equation model that compensated for the indirect effects of climate on the pathogen community via tick community composition suggested that while the environment strongly regulates tick community composition and tick community composition strongly regulates pathogen community composition, abiotic influences on pathogen species richness and community composition are weak. Our results support the view that changes in the broader environment will influence tick-borne pathogens primarily via the influence of the environment on ticks. The interactions that regulate host-vector-pathogen dynamics are of particular relevance in understanding the relationships between environmental change and health concerns, such as the impact of climate change on the occurrence of vector-borne diseases.

TI Host propagation permits extreme local adaptation in a social parasite
   of ants
AB The Red Data Book hoverfly species Microdon mutabilis is an extreme specialist that parasitises ant societies. The flies are locally adapted to a single host, Formica lemani, more intimately than was thought possible in host-parasite systems. Microdon egg survival plummeted in F. lemani colonies > 3 km away from the natal nest, from c. 96% to 0% to < 50%, depending on the hoverfly population. This is reflected in the life-time dispersal of females, measured at < 2 m, resulting in oviposition back into the same ant nests for generation after generation. To counter destabilizing effects on the host, Microdon manipulates the social dynamics of F. lemani by feeding selectively on ant eggs and small larvae, which causes surviving larvae to switch development into queens. Infested colonies rear double the number of new queens, thus propagating the vulnerable local genotype and compensating for damage to the host colonies. The consequences of such extreme host specificity for insect conservation are discussed.

TI Local maladaptation in the soft scale insect Saissetia coffeae
   (Hemiptera : Coccidae)
AB Local adaptation has often been documented in herbivorous insects. The potential for local maladaptation in phytophagous insects, however, has not been widely considered. I performed a two-generation reciprocal crosstransplant experiment with the generalist soft scale insect Saissetia coffeae (Hemiptera: Coccidae) on two common species of host plants in rain forest habitat in Costa Rica. In this system, S. coffeae showed significant local maladaptation at the level of the host species. Lineages originally collected from Witheringia enjoyed a strong advantage over those collected from Lomariopsis when both sets of lineages were placed on Lomariopsis; however, when both sets of lineages were raised on Witheringia, their fitnesses were statistically indistinguishable. While some aspects of the biology of S. coffeae may impair its ability to adapt to local selection pressures, scale insects are often locally adapted on fine spatial scales, and local maladaptation is therefore especially surprising. Other documented cases of local maladaptation in parasites appear to be due to evolution on the part of the host. The possibility that hosts or natural enemies may place local genotypes at a disadvantage, producing a pattern of local maladaptation, is one that deserves more consideration in the context of plant-insect interactions.

TI Host-parasite interactions for virulence and resistance in a malaria
   model system
AB A rich body of theory on the evolution of virulence (disease severity) attempts to predict the conditions that cause parasites to harm their hosts, and a central assumption to many of these models is that the relative virulence of pathogen strains is stable across a range of host types. In contrast, a largely nonoverlapping body of theory on coevolution assumes that the fitness effects of parasites on hosts is not stable across host genotype, but instead depends on host genotype by parasite genotype interactions. If such genetic interactions largely determine virulence, it becomes difficult to predict the strength and direction of selection on virulence. In this study, we tested for host-by-parasite interactions in a medically relevant vertebrate disease model: the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice. We found that parasite and particularly host main effects explained most of the variance in virulence (anaemia and weight loss), resistance (parasite burden) and transmission potential. Host-by-parasite interactions were of limited influence, but nevertheless had significant effects. This raises the possibility that host heterogeneity may affect the rate of any parasite response to selection on virulence. This study of rodent malaria is one of the first tests for host-by-parasite interactions in any vertebrate disease; host-by-parasite interactions typical of those assumed in coevolutionary models were present, but were by no means pervasive.

TI The 37-kDa/67-kDa laminin receptor acts as a receptor for infectious
   prions and is inhibited by polysulfated glycanes
AB Background. Recently, we showed that the 37-kDa/67-kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) acts as the receptor of the cellular prion protein.
   Methods. For the present study, we investigated the binding of the murine scrapie prion protein (moPrP27-30) to baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, using the Semliki Forest virus system.
   Results. The enhanced binding of moPrP27-30 to BHK cells expressing moLRP::FLAG was inhibited by the LRP/LR-specific antibody W3, which suggests that LRP/LR acts as a receptor for the scrapie form of the prion protein, PrPSc. This finding was confirmed by a parallel study that showed that bovine prions are internalized by human enterocytes via LRP/LR. The heparan sulfate mimetics HM5004 and HM2602 reduced PrP27-30 binding to moLRP-expressing cells to similar to 30% and similar to 20%, respectively, at a concentration of 10 mu g/mL, whereas pentosan polysulfate (SP54) and phycarin sulfate (PS3) both reduced the binding to similar to 40% at a concentration of 100 mu g/ mL.
   Conclusions. We suggest that the inhibition reported elsewhere of PrPSc synthesis and the incubation times prolonged in rodent models by these sulfated glycans are due to the inhibition of the LRP/LR-dependent binding of prions to the target cells.

TI Recombination and selection shape the molecular diversity pattern of
   nitrogen-fixing Sinorhizobium sp associated to Medicago
AB We investigate the genetic structure and molecular selection pattern of a sympatric population of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium medicae. These bacteria fix nitrogen in association with plants of the genus Medicago. A set of 116 isolates were obtained from a soil sample, from root nodules of three groups of plants representing among-species, within-species and intraline diversity in the Medicago genus. Bacteria were characterized by sequencing at seven loci evenly distributed along the genome of both Sinorhizobium species, covering the chromosome and the two megaplasmids. We first test whether the diversity of host plants influence the bacterial diversity recovered. Using the same data set, we then analyse the selective pattern at each locus. There was no relationship between the diversity of Medicago plants that were used for sampling and the diversity of their symbionts. However, we found evidence of selection within each of the two main symbiotic regions, located on the two different megaplasmids. Purifying selection or a selective sweep was found to occur in the nod genomic region, which includes genes involved in nodulation specificity, whereas balancing selection was detected in the exo region, close to genes involved in exopolysaccharide production. Such pattern likely reflects the interaction between host plants and bacterial symbionts, with a possible conflict of interest between plants and cheater bacterial genotypes. Recombination appears to occur preferentially within and among loci located on megaplasmids, rather than within the chromosome. Thus, recombination may play an important role in resolving this conflict by allowing different selection patterns at different loci.

TI Role of California (Callipepla californica) and Gambel's (Callipepla

   California, USA
AB Gambel's and California quail were infected repeatedly whenever western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), and (WNV) West Nile virus were active during summer in California. The timing of virus appearance and quail infection coincided well with the appearance of chicks in nature, leading us to hypothesize that large coveys containing these non-immune birds could be important in focal virus amplification in rural settings. However, experimental infection studies with chicks, juveniles, and adults of both quail species using sympatric strains of WEEV, SLEV, and WNV indicated that only immature birds were competent hosts for WEEV, producing viremias sufficiently elevated to efficiently infect Culex tarsalis mosquitoes. Quail were less competent hosts for WNV and were incompetent for SLEV. Large populations of quail that frequently are infected with SLEV or WNV, but produce low to moderate viremias, may serve as dead end hosts for these viruses. Due to their abundance and repeated infection, these birds may attenuate virus amplification in rural areas of California and possibly could be one reason why WNV epidemics seem to occur more frequently in urban and periurban than in rural landscapes.

Not covering roughage and the farmers' assumption that pigs can come into contact with cat feces also showed a positive relationship. In order to decrease the risk of T. gondii infecting their pigs, farmers should limit the access and number of cats on their farms and refrain from feeding goat whey to their pigs.

In this paper, the authors present a framework to monitor the efficacy of control measures in real time. Bayesian estimation of the reproduction number R (mean number of cases generated by a single infectious person) during an outbreak allows them to judge rapidly whether the epidemic is under control (R < 1). Only counts and time of onset of symptoms, plus tracing information from a subset of cases, are required. Markov chain Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo sampling are used to infer the temporal pattern of R up to the last observation. The operating characteristics of the method are investigated in a simulation study of severe acute respiratory syndrome-like outbreaks. In this particular setting, control measures lacking efficacy (R >= 1.1) could be detected after 2 weeks in at least 70% of the epidemics, with less than a 5% probability of a wrong conclusion. When control measures are efficacious (R = 0.5), this situation may be evidenced in 68% of the epidemics after 2 weeks and 92% of the epidemics after 3 weeks, with less than a 5% probability of a wrong conclusion.

TI Host heterogeneity dominates West Nile virus transmission
AB Heterogeneity in host populations and communities can have large effects on the transmission and control of a pathogen. In extreme cases, a few individuals give rise to the majority of secondary infections, which have been termed super spreading events. Here, we show that transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) is dominated by extreme heterogeneity in the host community, resulting in highly inflated reproductive ratios. A single relatively uncommon avian species, American robin (Turdus migratorius), appeared to be responsible for the majority of WNV-infectious mosquitoes and acted as the species equivalent of a super spreader for this multi-host pathogen. Crows were also highly preferred by mosquitoes at some sites, while house sparrows were significantly avoided. Nonetheless, due to their relative rarity, corvids (crows and jays) were relatively unimportant in WNV amplification. These results challenge current beliefs about the role of certain avian species in WNV amplification and demonstrate the importance of determining contact rates between vectors and host species to understand pathogen transmission dynamics.

TI Evidence for transmission of Plasmodium vivax among a Duffy antigen
   negative population in western Kenya
AB We present evidence that a parasite with characteristics of Plasmodium vivax is being transmitted among Duffy blood group-negative inhabitants of Kenya. Thirty-two of 4,901 Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus (0.65%) collected in Nyanza Province were ELISA positive for the P. vivax circumsporozoite protein VK 247. All positives were found late in the rainy season, when An. funestus predominated, and disproportionately many were found at a single village. A P. vivax specific sequence of the SSU rRNA gene was amplified from three of six ELISA-positive mosquitoes. Erythrocytes from 31 children, including 9 microscopically diagnosed as infected with P. vivax, were negative by flow cytometry for the Fy3 or Fy6 epitopes, which indicate Duffy blood group expression. A DNA fragment specific for the C terminus of the gene for P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) was amplified from the blood of four of these children and subsequently sequenced from two.

TI Experimental infection of the neotropical malaria vector Anopheles
   darlingi by human patient-derived Plasmodium vivax in the Peruvian
   Amazon
AB Malaria transmission from humans to mosquitoes is modulated by human host immune factors. Understanding mechanisms by which the human host response may impair parasite infectivity for mosquitoes has direct implications for the development of transmission-blocking vaccines. We hypothesized that despite a low transmission intensity of malaria in the Peruvian Amazon region of Iquitos, transmission-blocking immunity against Plasmodium vivax might be common, given an unexpectedly high proportion of asymptomatic parasitemic individuals in this region. To test this hypothesis, the ability of symptomatic P. vivax malaria patients to experimentally infect wild-caught outbred Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes was tested using the indirect membrane feeding technique. Only half (52/102) of P. vivax parasitemic patients successfully infected mosquitoes. Transmitters were more likely to have gametocytes (OR 6.35, P = 0.003), high parasitemia (OR 3.79, P = 0.024), and, in terms of basic clinical parameters, a slower pulse rate (mean +/- SD: 82.3 +/- 12.3 versus 88.7 +/- 13.5, P = 0.016) than non-transmitters. Log(10) gametocytemia and log(10) real-time reverse transcriptase Pvs25 PCR quantifying gametocytes were significantly and positively correlated with oocyst counts (correlation coefficient 0.505, R-2 = 0.26, P = 0.001). These experiments are the first to establish a system of determining transmission patterns in experimental infection of outbred natural neotropical malaria vectors in the Amazon region. Patients with P. vivax inefficiently infect outbred An. darlingi mosquitoes, raising the possibility that some degree of naturally occurring transmission-blocking immunity is present on a population basis in the Peruvian Amazon, an area of low intensity of malaria transmission.

TI Scabies mite inactivated serine protease paralogues are present both
   internally in the mite gut and externally in feces
AB The scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, is the causative agent of scabies, a disease that is common among disadvantaged populations and facilitates streptococcal infections with serious sequelae. Previously, we encountered large families of genes encoding paralogues of house dust mite protease allergens with their catalytic sites inactivated by mutation (scabies mite inactivated protease paralogues [SMIPPs]). We postulated that SMIPPs have evolved as an adaptation to the parasitic lifestyle of the scabies mite, functioning as competitive inhibitors of proteases involved in the host-parasite interaction. To propose testable hypotheses for their functions, it is essential to know their locations in the mite. Here we show by immunohistochemistry that SMIPPs exist in two compartments: 1) internal to the mite in the gut and 2) external to the mite after excretion from the gut in scybala (fecal pellets). SMIPPs may well function in both of these compartments to evade host proteases.

TI Short report: Exposure to human respiratory viruses among urban
   performing monkeys in Indonesia
AB Performing monkeys, a common phenomena in Asia, occupy a unique urban niche that comprises a number of factors influencing the likelihood of cross-species transmission of pathogens. Here we present the first documented evidence of exposure to measles, rubella, and parainfluenza in a population of performing monkeys. Evidence of exposure to these endemic human respiratory viruses in the performing monkeys confirms human-to-primate transmission and suggests the possibility of prim ate-to-human transmission. Urban animal markets, the likely source of these performing monkeys, may represent an environment conducive to the mixing of animals and pathogens, making these monkeys a potential conduit for infectious agents passing from a variety of animals found in animal markets to humans. The potential significance of these results to human public health and the unique contexts of disease transmission associated with the urban ecology of the performance monkeys are discussed. Given the level of overseas travel, this potential threat is not confined solely to Asia.

TI Interactions between the parasite's previous and current environment
   mediate the outcome of parasite infection
AB The study of parasite virulence has generally focused on the conditions under which virulence is expected to increase or decrease over time and how the interactions between hosts and their environments may mediate the outcome of infection. Recently, parasite traits such as transmission, offspring production, and development have also been shown to be influenced by environmental variation. What is unclear is how variation in the parasite's environment may impact virulence. Recent theory demonstrates that plasticity can promote the evolution of decreased virulence; thus, understanding whether the parasite's environment can mediate virulence can improve predictions regarding the outcome of parasite infection. Here, an obligate mosquito parasite was reared in hosts fed high or low levels of food. Parasite oocysts (offspring) produced in these two host environments were subsequently fed to uninfected hosts. Parasites originating from well-fed hosts were found to be more virulent to these subsequent hosts compared to parasites originating from poorly fed hosts. Additionally, this effect was apparent only when current hosts were food deprived. These results demonstrate that parasite virulence was mediated by a cross-generational effect of the environment and that the overall outcome of infection was modified by variation in both the parasite's and host's environments.

TI The ecology of virulence
AB Theoretical work has shown that parasites should evolve intermediate levels of virulence. Less attention has been given to the ecology of virulence. Here I explore population-dynamic models of infection in an annual host. The infection does not kill the host; but it can decrease the number of offspring produced by the host, and the magnitude of this effect depends on host population size. Hence, 'virulence' is density dependent, and is defined here as the difference in birth rates between uninfected and infected hosts, divided by the birth rate of uninfected hosts. The results suggest that infection can be highly virulent at the host's equilibrium density, even though the parasite has no effect on the host's intrinsic birth rate. The results also suggest that parasites may help to stabilize host population dynamics. In general, the impact of infection may be underestimated in natural populations.

TI Within-population variation in cytoplasmic genes affects female life
   span and aging in Drosophila melanogaster
AB It has been suggested that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may play an important role in aging. Yet, few empirical studies have tested this hypothesis, partly because the degree of sequence polymorphism in mtDNA is assumed to be low. However, low sequence variation may not necessarily translate into low phenotypic variation. Here, we report an experiment that tests whether there is within-population variation in cytoplasmic genes for female longevity and senescence. To achieve this, we randomly selected 25 "mitochondrial founders" from a single, panmictic population of Drosophila melanogaster and used these founders to generate distinct "mt" lines in which we controlled for the nuclear background by successive backcrossing. Potential confounding effects of cytoplasmically transmitted bacteria were eliminated by tetracycline treatment. The mt lines were then assayed for differences in longevity, Gompertz intercept (frailty), and demographic rate of change in mortality with age (rate-of-senescence) in females. We found significant cytoplasmic effects on all three variables. This provides evidence that genetic variation in cytoplasmic genes, presumably mtDNA, contributes to variation in female mortality and aging.

TI The role of body size in host specificity: Reciprocal transfer
   experiments with feather lice
AB Although most parasites show at least some degree of host specificity, factors governing the evolution of specificity remain poorly understood. Many different groups of host-specific parasites show a striking correlation between parasite and host body size, suggesting that size reinforces specificity. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the relative fitness of host-specific feather lice transferred to pigeons and doves that differ in size by an order of magnitude. To test the general influence of size, we transferred unrelated groups of wing and body lice, which are specialized for different regions of the host. Lice were transferred in both directions, from a large native host species, the rock pigeon (Columba livia), to several progressively smaller hosts, and from a small native host species, the common ground dove (Columbina passerina), to several larger hosts. We measured the relative fitness (population size) of lice transferred to these novel host species after two louse generations. Neither wing lice nor body lice could survive on novel host species that were smaller in size than the native host. However, when host defense (preening behavior) was blocked, both groups survived and reproduced on all novel hosts tested. Thus, host defense interacted with host size to govern the ability of lice to establish on small hosts. Neither wing lice nor body lice could survive on larger hosts, even when preening was blocked. In summary, host size influenced the fitness of both types of feather lice, but through different mechanisms, depending on the direction of the transfer. Our results indicate that host switching is most likely between hosts of similar body size. This finding has important implications for studies of host-parasite coevolution at both the micro- and macroevolutionary scales.

TI Maternal immunoglobulin concentration in Collared Flycatcher (Ficedula
   albicollis) eggs in relation to parental quality and laying order
AB 1. The immune system of newly hatched birds is relatively immature; therefore pathogens can be particularly virulent. Females transfer passive immunity in terms of immunoglobulins to the eggs to protect their young against infections in the crucial early life stages.
   2. As transmission of antibodies is likely to be nutritionally costly, mothers are expected to allocate these components differentially to eggs according to their own condition, the quality of their mate or the laying order of eggs.
   3. We found that in Collared Flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), yolk antibody levels positively correlated with female body condition, but showed no relationship with maternal age or body size. Furthermore, females with higher plasma heterophil : lymphocyte ratio and heterophil count, which may indicate higher level of stress, deposited lower amount of immunoglobulins to their eggs. These results suggest that females of better physiological condition were able to invest more immunoglobulins to their eggs.
   4. Neither the plumage characteristics, nor the age of the male parent was related to yolk antibody concentration, and thus no evidence for differential allocation of antibodies in relation to male quality or attractiveness could be detected.
   5. Last-laid eggs contained higher yolk immunoglobulin concentration than earlier-laid eggs within a clutch. This pattern could be interpreted as a way to improve the survival probability of the disadvantaged last-hatching nestling.

TI The role of compensatory mutations in the emergence of drug resistance
AB Pathogens that evolve resistance to drugs usually have reduced fitness. However, mutations that largely compensate for this reduction in fitness often arise. We investigate how these compensatory mutations affect population-wide resistance emergence as a function of drug treatment. Using a model of gonorrhea transmission dynamics, we obtain generally applicable, qualitative results that show how compensatory mutations lead to more likely and faster resistance emergence. We further show that resistance emergence depends on the level of drug use in a strongly nonlinear fashion. We also discuss what data need to be obtained to allow future quantitative predictions of resistance emergence.

TI Transgenerational priming of immunity: maternal exposure to a bacterial
   antigen enhances offspring humoral immunity
AB Young vertebrates have limited capacity to synthesize antibodies and are dependent on the protection of maternally transmitted antibodies for humoral disease resistance early in life. However, mothers may enhance fitness by priming their offspring's immune systems to elevate disease resistance. Transgenerational induced defences have been documented in plants and invertebrates, but maternal priming of offspring immunity in vertebrates has been essentially neglected. To test the ability of mothers to stimulate the immune systems of offspring, we manipulated maternal and offspring antigen exposure in a wild population of birds, pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). We show that immunization of the mother before egg laying apparently stimulates a transgenerational defence against pathogens by elevating endogenous offspring antibody production. If the disease environments encountered by mothers and offspring are similar, this transgenerational immune priming may allow young to better cope with the local pathogen fauna.

TI Self-harm caused by an insect's innate immunity
AB It has been a long-held assumption that the innate immune system of insects causes self-harm when used to combat an immune insult. We show empirically that this assumption is correct. Invertebrate innate immunity relies heavily on effector systems which, on activation, produce cytotoxins that kill pathogens. Reliance on these robust, fast-acting, generic killing mechanisms ensures a potent and rapid response to pathogen invasion, but has the potential disadvantage of causing self-damage. We show that the innate immune response against an immune insult produces measurable phenotypic and functional damage to self-tissue in the beetle Tenebrio molitor. This type of self-harm (autoreactivity) and the life-history implications that arise from it are important to understand evolutionary phenomena such as the dynamics between hosts and parasites as well as the nature of immune system costs.

TI Prevalence of HPV infection among men: A systematic review of the
   literature
AB Background. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection; an estimated 6.2 million persons are newly infected every year in the United States. There are limited data on HPV infection in heterosexual men.
   Methods. We conducted a systematic review of the literature by searching MEDLINE using the terms "human papillomavirus," "HPV," "male," "seroprevalence," and "serology" to retrieve articles published from 1 January 1990 to 1 February 2006. We included studies that had data on population characteristics and that evaluated male genital anatomic sites or specimens for HPV DNA or included assessments of seropositivity to HPV type 6, 11, 16, or 18 in men. We excluded studies that had been conducted only in children or immunocompromised persons (HIV infected, transplant recipients, or elderly).
   Results. We included a total of 40 publications on HPV DNA detection and risk factors for HPV in men; 27 evaluated multiple anatomic sites or specimens, 10 evaluated a single site or specimen, and 3 evaluated risk factors or optimal anatomic sites/specimens for HPV detection. Twelve studies assessed site- or specimen-specific HPV DNA detection. HPV prevalence in men was 1.3%-72.9% in studies in which multiple anatomic sites or specimens were evaluated; 15 (56%) of these studies reported >= 20% HPV prevalence. HPV prevalence varied on the basis of sampling, processing methods, and the anatomic site(s) or specimen(s) sampled. We included 15 publications reporting HPV seroprevalence. Rates of seropositivity depended on the population, HPV type, and methods used. In 9 studies that evaluated both men and women, all but 1 demonstrated that HPV seroprevalence was lower in men than in women.
   Conclusion. HPV infection is highly prevalent in sexually active men and can be detected by use of a variety of specimens and methods. There have been few natural-history studies and no transmission studies of HPV in men. The information that we have reviewed may be useful for future natural-history studies and for modeling the potential impact of a prophylactic HPV vaccine.

TI Effect of perinatal antiretroviral drug exposure on hematologic values
   in HIV-uninfected children: An analysis of the women and infants
   transmission study
AB Background. With the increasing use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), large numbers of infants are exposed, with possible consequent toxicity.
   Methods. Hematologic values in 1820 uninfected HIV- and ARV-exposed children were compared with those in 351 ARV-unexposed children from the Women and Infants Transmission Study. Hemoglobin concentrations and platelet, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell counts were analyzed at birth and ages 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Multivariate analysis was conducted age 0-2 and 6-24 months, with adjustment for multiple cofactors.
   Results. Hemoglobin concentrations and neutrophil, lymphocyte, and CD4(+) cell counts were significantly lower at age 0-2 months in infants exposed to ARV drugs than in those who were not. At 6-24 months, differences in hemoglobin concentrations and neutrophil counts were no longer significant, whereas differences in platelet, lymphocyte, and CD4(+) cell counts persisted and CD8(+) cell counts became significantly lower. In comparison with ARV monotherapy, combination therapy was associated with larger decreases in neutrophil, lymphocyte, and CD8(+) cell counts at age 0-2 months but with only differences in CD8(+) cell counts at age 6 - 24 months. Clinically significant abnormalities were rare and did not differ by exposure to ARV drugs.
   Conclusion. Infants exposed to ARV drugs have small but significant differences in several hematologic parameters for the first 24 months of life. These results indicate the need for long-term follow-up of uninfected infants with ARV exposure.

   village in india: Preliminary serologic survey of the local population
AB After discovery of the first recorded case of human infection with Trypanosoma evansi, serologic screening of 1,806 persons from the village of origin of the patient in India was performed using the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis and T. evansi. A total of 410 (22.7%) people were positive by whole blood, but only 81 were confirmed positive by serum. However, no trypanosomes were detected in the blood of 60 people who were positive at a high serum dilution. The results probably indicate frequent exposure of the human population to T evansi in the study area, which suggests frequent vector transmission of parasites to humans. Although T. evansi is not infective for humans, a follow-up of seropositive persons is required to observe the evolution of human infection with this parasite.

New probes were also designed to distinguish three variants within the TcIId sublineage. The IIb, IId, or IIe T. cruzi sublineages, as well as different variants of the IId sublineage, were detected in infected neonates, whereas mixed infections were not found. The frequencies of the IId sublineage were similar in neonates (95.1%) and adults of the same area (94.1%). The IId-infected newborns displayed either asymptomatic, or severe and fatal clinical forms of congenital Chagas disease, as well as low or high parasitemia. Altogether these data show that T cruzi DNA polymorphism, based on the presently available markers, is not associated with the occurrence of congenital infection or the development of severe clinical forms of congenital Chagas disease.

TI Aedes aegypti vectorial capacity is determined by the infecting genotype
   of dengue virus
AB Dengue viruses causing severe, hemorrhagic disease have displaced less virulent strains in the Americas during the past three decades. The American (AM) genotype of dengue serotype 2 has been endemic in the Western Hemisphere and South Pacific, causing outbreaks of dengue fever (DF), but has not been linked to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The Southeast Asian (SEA) genotype of dengue was introduced into this hemisphere in 1981, has caused outbreaks with numerous cases of DHF, and has displaced the AM genotype in several countries. We investigated the effect of viral genotype on the potential for transmission by infecting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected in South Texas with six viruses, representing these two genotypes. Viral replication in the midgut was significantly higher in SEA-infected mosquitoes, and virus-specific proteins could be detected in salivary glands 7 days earlier in SEA- than AM-infected mosquitoes. This much earlier appearance of dengue virus in salivary glands resulted in an estimated 2- to 65-fold increase in the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes for the viruses that can cause DHF. This may be one of the mechanisms through which more virulent flaviviruses spread and displace others globally.

TI Host-parasite coevolution and selection on sex through the effects of
   segregation
AB The advantage of producing novel variation to keep apace of coevolving species has been invoked as a major explanation for the evolution and maintenance of sex ( the Red Queen hypothesis). Recent theoretical investigations of the Red Queen hypothesis have focused on the effects of recombination in haploid species, finding that species interactions rarely favor the evolution of sex unless selection is strong. Yet by focusing on haploids, these studies have ignored a potential advantage of sex in diploids: generating novel combinations of alleles at a particular locus through segregation. Here we investigate models of host-parasite coevolution in diploid species to determine whether the advantages of segregation might rescue the Red Queen hypothesis as a more general explanation for the evolution of sex. We find that the effects of segregation can favor the evolution of sex but only under some models of infection and some parameter combinations, almost always requiring inbreeding. In all other cases, the effects of segregation on selected loci favor reductions in the frequency of sex. In cases where segregation and recombination act in opposite directions, we found that the effects of segregation dominate as an evolutionary force acting on sex in diploids.

TI The impact of parasite manipulation and predator foraging behavior on
   predator-prey communities
AB Parasites are known to directly affect their hosts at both the individual and population level. However, little is known about their more subtle, indirect effects and how these may affect population and community dynamics. In particular, trophically transmitted parasites may manipulate the behavior of intermediate hosts, fundamentally altering the pattern of contact between these individuals and their predators. Here, we develop a suite of population dynamic models to explore the impact of such behavioral modifications on the dynamics and structure of the predator-prey community. We show that, although such manipulations do not directly affect the persistence of the predator and prey populations, they can greatly alter the quantitative dynamics of the community, potentially resulting in high amplitude oscillations in abundance. We show that the precise impact of host manipulation depends greatly on the predator's functional response, which describes the predator's foraging efficiency under changing prey availabilities. Even if the parasite is rarely observed within the prey population, such manipulations extend beyond the direct impact on the intermediate host to affect the foraging success of the predator, with profound implications for the structure and stability of the predator-prey community.

TI Density dependence and the control of helminth parasites
AB 1. The transient dynamics and stability of a population are determined by the interplay between species density, its spatial distribution and the positive and negative density-dependent processes regulating population growth.
   2. Using the human-helminth parasite system as an example, we propose that the life-stage upon which negative density dependence operates will influence the rate of host reinfection following anthelmintic chemotherapy, and the likely success of control programmes.
   3. Simple deterministic models are developed which highlight how a parasite species whose population size is down-regulated by density-dependent establishment will reinfect a host population at a faster rate than a species with density-dependent parasite fecundity.
   4. Different forms of density dependence can produce the same equilibrium behaviour but different transient dynamics. Under-representing the nature and magnitude of density-dependent mechanisms, and in particular those operating upon establishing life-stages, may cause the resilience of the parasite population to a control perturbation to be underestimated.

TI Are ectoparasite communities structured? Species co-occurrence, temporal
   variation and null models
AB 1. We studied temporal variation in the structure of flea communities on small mammalian hosts from eastern Slovakia using null models. We asked (a) whether flea co-occurrences in infracommunities (in the individual hosts) in different hosts as well as in the component communities (in the host species) demonstrate a non-random pattern; (b) whether this pattern is indicative of either positive or negative flea species interactions; (c) whether this pattern varies temporally; and (d) whether the expression of this pattern is related to population size of either fleas or hosts or both.
   2. We constructed a presence/absence matrix of flea species for each temporal sample of a host species and calculated four metrics of co-occurrence, namely the C-score, the number of checkerboard species pairs, the number of species combinations and the variance ratio (V-ratio). Then we compared these metrics with the respective indices calculated for 5000 null matrices that were assembled randomly using two algorithms, namely fixed-fixed (FF) and fixed-equiprobable (FE).
   3. Most co-occurrence metrics calculated for real data did not differ significantly from the metrics calculated for simulated matrices using the FF algorithm. However, the indices observed for 42 of 75 presence/absence matrices differed significantly from the null expectations for the FE models. Non-randomness was detected mainly by the C-score and V-ratio metrics. In all cases, the direction of non-randomness was the same, namely the aggregation, not competition, of flea species in host individuals and host species.
   4. The inclusion or exclusion of the uninfested hosts in the FE models did not affect the results for individual host species. However, exclusion of the uninfested host species led to the acceptance of the null hypothesis for only six of 13 temporal samples of the component flea communities for which non-randomness was detected when the uninfested hosts were included in the analysis.
   5. In most host species, the absolute values of the standardized size effect of both the C-score and V-ratio increased with an increase in host density and a concomitant decrease in flea abundance and prevalence.
   6. Results of this study demonstrated that (a) flea assemblages on small mammalian hosts were structured at some times, whereas they appeared to be randomly assembled at other times; (b) whenever non-randomness of flea co-occurrences was detected, it suggested aggregation but never segregation of flea species in host individuals or populations; and (c) the expression of structure in flea assemblages depended on the level of density of both fleas and hosts.

   populations: delayed density dependence and individual risk
AB 1. Little is known about the dynamics of pathogen (microparasite) infection in wildlife populations, and less still about sources of variation in the risk of infection. Here we present the first detailed analysis of such variation.
   2. Cowpox virus is an endemic sublethal pathogen circulating in populations of wild rodents. Cowpox prevalence was monitored longitudinally for 2 years, in populations of field voles exhibiting multiannual cycles of density in Kielder Forest, UK.
   3. The probability that available susceptible animals seroconverted in a given trap session was significantly positively related to host density with a 3-month time lag.
   4. Males were significantly more likely to seroconvert than females.
   5. Despite most infection being found in young animals (because transmission rates were generally high) mature individuals were more likely to seroconvert than immature ones, suggesting that behavioural or physiological changes associated with maturity contribute to variation in infection risk.
   6. Hence, these analyses confirm that there is a delayed numerical response of cowpox infection to vole density, supporting the hypothesis that endemic pathogens may play some part in shaping vole cycles.

TI On the track of the Red Queen: bark beetles, their nematodes, local
   climate and geographic parthenogenesis
AB Geographic parthenogenesis has been explained as resulting from parasite pressure (Red Queen hypothesis): several studies have found high degrees of sexuals where the prevalence of parasites is high. However, it is important to address whether prevalence of parasites mirrors risk of infection. We explored geographic parthenogenesis of Ips acuminatus bark beetles and their nematodes. Local climate is crucial for nematode stages outside the host, in spring and summer, and prevalence should thus be associated with those temperatures if prevalence reliably reflects exposure risk across populations. This was the case; however, high prevalence of a virulent nematode species was not associated with many sexuals, whereas highly sexual populations were characterized by high infection risk of benign nematodes. Low virulence of the latter makes Red Queen dynamics unlikely. Geographical patterns of parthenogenesis were instead associated with winter temperature and variance in temperature.

TI Resistance in introduced populations of a freshwater snail to native
   range parasites
AB Introduced species provide an opportunity to examine responses to novel ecological conditions, in particular to the absence of co-evolved enemies. Introduced populations could evolve lower investment in resistance or could down-regulate their immune system as a plastic response to enemy absence. The response might have consequences for the success of introduced species. Assuming a trade-off between resistance and traits related to demographic success, an evolved change or reallocation from resistance could increase the chances of invasions. On the other hand, introduced populations could have increased resistance as a correlate of greater vigour and competitive ability among successful invaders [Sampling Bias hypothesis (SBH)]. These hypotheses make different predictions about investment in resistance in introduced populations. Using a New Zealand clonal snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), we examined the resistance of three introduced genotypes (one from the US and two from Europe) to several populations of a native range parasite (Microphallus sp.). One genotype (Euro A) was resistant to all native range parasite populations, consistent with the SBH. However, two remaining genotypes (Euro C and US 1) were less susceptible to parasite populations that were allopatric to their source populations. Furthermore, resistance of one genotype (US 1) collected from the introduced range was indistinguishable from its resistance when collected from the range of the parasite. Hence, there was no evidence for decreased resistance in the absence of native enemies, which is inconsistent with hypotheses that envision reduced allocation to resistance or a trade-off between competitive ability and resistance.

TI Relative number of generations of hosts and parasites does not influence
   parasite local adaptation in coevolving populations of bacteria and
   phages
AB A potential consequence of host-parasite coevolution in spatially structured populations is parasite local adaptation: local parasites perform better than foreign parasites on their local host populations. It has been suggested that the generally shorter generation times of parasites compared with their hosts contributes to parasites, rather than hosts, being locally adapted. We tested the hypothesis that relative generation times of hosts and parasites affect local adaptation of hosts and parasites, using the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and a lytic phage as host and parasite, respectively. Generation times were not directly manipulated, but instead one of the coevolving partners was regularly removed and replaced with a population from an earlier time point. Thus, one partner underwent more generations than the other. Manipulations were carried out at both early and later periods of coevolutionary interactions. At early stages of coevolution, host and parasites that underwent relatively more generations displayed higher levels of resistance and infectivity, respectively. However, the relative number of generations that bacteria and phages underwent did not change the level of local adaptation relative to control populations. This is likely because generalist hosts and parasites are favoured during early stages of coevolution, preventing local adaptation. By contrast, at later stages manipulations had no effect on either average levels of resistance or infectivity, or alter the level of local adaptation relative to the controls, possibly because traits other than resistance and infectivity were under strong selection. Taken together, these data suggest that the relative generation times of hosts and parasites may not be an important determinant of local adaptation in this system.

TI Increased male mating rate in Drosophila is associated with Wolbachia
   infection
AB The maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia pipientis infects 25-75% of arthropods and manipulates host reproduction to improve its transmission. One way Wolbachia achieves this is by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), where crosses between infected males and uninfected females are inviable. Infected males suffer reduced fertility through CI and reduced sperm production. However, Wolbachia induce lower levels of CI in nonvirgin males. We examined the impact of Wolbachia on mating behaviour in male Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, which display varying levels of CI, and show that infected males mate at a higher rate than uninfected males in both species. This may serve to increase the spread of Wolbachia, or alternatively, may be a behavioural adaptation employed by males to reduce the level of CI. Mating at high rate restores reproductive compatibility with uninfected females resulting in higher male reproductive success thus promoting male promiscuity. Increased male mating rates also have implications for the transmission of Wolbachia.

TI Avian influenza: An agricultural perspective
AB Recent outbreaks of infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 strains of avian influenza virus in poultry in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East have raised concern over the potential emergence of a pandemic strain that can easily infect humans and cause serious morbidity and mortality. To prevent and control a national outbreak, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducts measures based on the ecology of avian influenza viruses. To prevent an outbreak in the United States, the USDA conducts surveillance of bird populations, restrictions on bird importation, educational outreach, and regulation of agricultural practices, in collaboration with local, state, and federal organizations. To manage an outbreak, the USDA has in place a well-established emergency management system for optimizing efforts. The USDA also collaborates with international organizations for disease prevention and control in other countries.

TI Prevention and treatment of influenza in high-risk groups: Children,
   pregnant women, inununocompromised hosts, and nursing home residents
AB The pediatric population experiences preventable hospitalizations and serves as a reservoir for influenza and its transmission to other children as well as adults. As a consequence, the Advisory Committee on Immunization. Practices has recommended initiating influenza immunization of children as young as 6 months of age through. 23 months of age and, recently, up to 5 years of age. However, immunization of older children has not yet become a priority of the US Public Health Service. As a consequence, the importance of antiviral agents, particularly neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, cannot be overemphasized. From an epidemiological perspective,, influenza resulted in higher childhood mortality than did Bordetella pertussis infection in 2003-2004. During, that season, 153 children died of influenza, and two-thirds were < 5 years of age. Importantly, nearly 50% of these children were previously healthy, with no underlying illness. Currently, 2 NA inhibitors are approved. for the treatment of influenza in children. Zanamivir is approved for children > 7 years of age, and oseltamivir is approved for children > 1 year of age. Arguably, the younger children are at particular risk for influenza. complications and hospitalization. In placebo-controlled studies in children > 1 year of age, oseltamivir therapy accelerated resolution of clinical illness and defervescence and decreased both the incidence of otitis media. and the concomitant use of antibiotics. However, oseltamivir is not currently approved for children < 1 year of age. Three clinical toxicology studies identified neurotoxicity in newborn rats administered this medication. In these preclinical toxicology studies, the dose of oseltamivir exceeded that which would be used in humans. In addition, the metabolism of oseltamivir is different in rats than in humans. A key component of influenza therapy is the possibility for development of resistance. Although in studies performed in North America, resistance was not a frequent event, it has been documented in Japanese children treated with this medication; the adequacy of the dose used has been questioned. Children represent only one unique study population among others. Individuals who are at increased risk for influenza infection include the elderly, the immunocompromised, and pregnant women. Collectively, antiviral medications must be evaluated in populations in which they have not yet been assessed. The development of additional antiviral drugs is an important recommendation for the future, so that antiviral resistance can be circumvented. Similarly, availability of drugs for children < 1 year of age is mandatory.

TI Mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1: timing and implications for
   prevention
AB This article provides a synthesis of clinical trial data with an aim to deduce the timing of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. Because transmission of the infection to the infant through breastfeeding is one of the main challenges in fighting paediatric HIV/AIDS in the developing world, we present separate estimates for the timing of HIV transmission for non-breastfeeding and breastfeeding populations. Our estimates predict that, for non-breastfeeding populations, 50% of HIV infections are transmitted to the infant at the very end of pregnancy, near to the time of labour. For breastfeeding populations, the postnatal period accounts for most of the HIV infections transmitted to the infant. We discuss the potential benefit of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life as a policy to decrease the magnitude of HIV transmission. Furthermore, we present the hypothesis, based on recent research findings of viral latency, that the time when a fetus initially encounters the virus might not be when infection is established. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis and how it could lead to new interventions for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission.

TI Can the common brain parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, influence human
   culture?
AB The latent prevalence of a long-lived and common brain parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, explains a statistically significant portion of the variance in aggregate neuroticisin among populations, as well as in the 'neurotic' cultural dimensions of sex roles and uncertainty avoidance. Spurious or non-causal correlations between aggregate personality and aspects of climate and culture that influence T gondii transmission could also drive these patterns. A link between culture and T gondii hypothetically results from a behavioural manipulation that the parasite uses to increase its transmission to the next host in the life cycle: a cat. While latent toxoplasmosis is usually benign, the parasite's subtle effect on individual personality appears to alter the aggregate personality at the population level. Drivers of the geographical variation in the prevalence of this parasite include the effects of climate on the persistence of infectious stages in soil, the cultural practices of food preparation and cats as pets. Some variation in culture, therefore, may ultimately be related to how climate affects the distribution of T gondii, though the results only explain a fraction of the variation in two of the four cultural dimensions, suggesting that if T gondii does influence human culture, it is only one among many factors.

TI Maternal antibodies postpone hantavirus infection and enhance individual
   breeding success
AB The transfer of maternal antibodies from mother to progeny is a well-known phenomenon in avian and mammalian species. Optimally, they protect the newborn against the pathogens in the environment. The effect of maternal antibodies on microparasite transmission dynamics may have important consequences for both the fitness of the host and the epizootic processes of the pathogens. However, there is a scarcity of studies examining these effects in free-living wild species. We studied the influence of maternal antibodies against the zoonotic Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) on the fitness of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and on PUUV transmission by exposing young maternal antibody-positive (MatAb +) and negative (MatAb -) bank voles (n = 160) to PUUV in experimental populations. PUUV-specific maternal antibodies delayed the timing of infection. Females were more susceptible to PUUV infection than males. Interestingly, both the females and the males with maternal antibodies matured earlier than the other individuals in the population. Our results highlight the significance of maternal antibodies in the transmission of a pathogen and in the breeding success of the carriers.

TI Using data on social contacts to estimate age-specific transmission
   parameters for respiratory-spread infectious agents
AB The estimation of transmission parameters has been problematic for diseases that rely predominantly on transmission of pathogens from person to person through small infectious droplets. Age-specific transmission parameters determine how such respiratory agents will spread among different age groups in a human population. Estimating the values of these parameters is essential in planning an effective response to potentially devastating pandemics of smallpox or influenza and in designing control strategies for diseases such as measles or mumps. In this study, the authors estimated age-specific transmission parameters by augmenting infectious disease data with auxiliary data on self-reported numbers of conversational partners per person. They show that models that use transmission parameters based on these self-reported social contacts are better able to capture the observed patterns of infection of endemically circulating mumps, as well as observed patterns of spread of pandemic influenza. The estimated age-specific transmission parameters suggested that school-aged children and young adults will experience the highest incidence of infection and will contribute most to further spread of infections during the initial phase of an emerging respiratory-spread epidemic in a completely susceptible population. These findings have important implications for controlling future outbreaks of novel respiratory-spread infectious agents.

TI Address-based versus random-digit-dial surveys: Comparison of key health
   and risk indicators
AB Use of random-digit dialing (RDD) for conducting health surveys is increasingly problematic because of declining participation rates and eroding frame coverage. Alternative survey modes and sampling frames may improve response rates and increase the validity of survey estimates. In a 2005 pilot study conducted in six states as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the authors administered a mail survey to selected household members sampled from addresses in a US Postal Service database. The authors compared estimates based on data from the completed mail surveys (n = 3,010) with those from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone surveys (n = 18,780). The mail survey data appeared reasonably complete, and estimates based on data from the two survey modes were largely equivalent. Differences found, such as differences in the estimated prevalences of binge drinking (mail = 20.3%, telephone = 13.1%) or behaviors linked to human immunodeficiency virus transmission (mail = 7.1%, telephone = 4.2%), were consistent with previous research showing that, for questions about sensitive behaviors, self-administered surveys generally produce higher estimates than interviewer-administered surveys. The mail survey also provided access to cell-phone-only households and households without telephones, which cannot be reached by means of standard RDD surveys.

TI The natural history of antibody responses to Cryptosporidium parasites
   in men at high risk of HIV infection
AB Background. Although the clinical severity of cryptosporidiosis is altered by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related immunosuppression, little is known about how risk for Cryptosporidium infection is altered by HIV.
   Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 78 participants of the San Francisco Men's Health Study, using stored serological specimens from 8.5 years of follow-up. Cryptosporidium infection was defined as an antibody response to both the recombinant 27-kDa (r27) and native Triton-extracted 17-kDa (TX17) Cryptosporidium antigens.
   Results. Cryptosporidium infections were detected more frequently by assessment of antibody responses than by routine clinical follow-up (195 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 154-241] vs. 11 [95% CI, 3-30] infections/1000 person-years, respectively). HIV-positive individuals (59%) were more likely than HIV-negative individuals (30%) to have had at least 1 serologically defined infection (P=.028). The estimated infection rate was 230 (95% CI, 175-293) infections/1000 person-years and 140 (95% CI, 86-210) infections/1000 person-years for HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals, respectively. Median decay time to half-life ranged from 13.8 to 15.1 months.
   Conclusions. Our study emphasizes that Cryptosporidium infections are common in this population. Although HIV status altered the risk of Cryptosporidium infection, further studies are needed to adequately examine the effect of CD4 cell count.

TI Do distantly related parasites rely on the same proximate factors to
   alter the behaviour of their hosts?
AB Phylogenetically unrelated parasites often increase the chances of their transmission by inducing similar phenotypic changes in their hosts. However, it is not known whether these convergent strategies rely on the same biochemical precursors. In this paper, we explored such aspects by studying two gammarid species (Gammarus insensibilis and Gammarus pulex; Crustacea: Amphipoda: Gammaridae) serving as intermediate hosts in the life cycle of two distantly related parasites: the trematode, Microphallus papillorobustus and the acanthocephalan, Polymorphus minutus. Both these parasite species are known to manipulate the behaviour of their amphipod hosts, bringing them towards the water surface, where they are preferentially eaten by aquatic birds (definitive hosts). By studying and comparing the brains of infected G. insensibilis and G. pulex with proteomics tools, we have elucidated some of the proximate causes involved in the parasite-induced alterations of host behaviour for each system. Protein identifications suggest that altered physiological compartments in hosts can be similar (e.g. immunoneural connexions) or different (e.g. vision process), and hence specific to the host-parasite association considered. Moreover, proteins required to alter the same physiological compartment can be specific or conversely common in both systems, illustrating in the latter case a molecular convergence in the proximate mechanisms of manipulation.

TI Tuberculosis mortality, drug resistance, and infectiousness in patients
   with and without HIV infection in Peru
AB The effects of HIV co-infection and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) on tuberculosis prognosis are poorly defined. Therefore, we studied infectiousness and mortality of 287 tuberculosis patients treated with standard, directly observed, short-course therapy in the Peruvian community. During 6-17 months of treatment, 49 (18%) of patients died, of whom 48 (98%) had AIDS and 28 (57%) had MDRTB; 17/31 (55%) of MDRTB-patients with AIDS died within 2 months of diagnosis, before traditional susceptibility testing would have identified their MDRTB. Most non-MDRTB became smear- and culture-negative within 6 weeks of therapy, whereas most MDRTB remained sputum-culture-positive until death or treatment completion. HIV-negative patients with non-MDRTB had good outcomes. However. MDRTB was associated with prolonged infectiousness and HIV co-infection with early mortality, indicating a need for greater access to anti-retroviral therapy. Furthermore, early and rapid tuberculosis drug-susceptibility testing and infection control are required so that MDRTB can be appropriately treated early enough to reduce mortality and transmission.

TI Short report: Higher percentages of circulating mast cell precursors
   correlate with susceptibility to reinfection with Schistosoma mansoni
AB A high level of serum IgE is generally associated with human resistance to schistosomes, though the protective mechanisms of IgE remain undefined. We recently reported that whereas some individuals who are occupationally hyperexposed to Schistosoma mansoni display resistance to reinfeetion, others remain highly susceptible, in some cases due to HIV-1 co-infection. As IgE functions, in part, through Fc epsilon RI on mast cells, we characterized circulating CD117(+) Fc epsilon RI+ mast cell precursors in this population. Surprisingly, a higher percentage of CD117(+) cells correlated with a susceptible phenotype in HIV-1 seronegative participants with schistosomiasis. There was no association between percentages of peripheral CD117(+) cells and susceptibility to reinfection in persons with HIV-1. Serum levels of polyclonal IgE were inversely correlated with percentages of CD117(+) cells regardless of HIV-1 status. Thus, immature mast cells may affect IgE availability, or IgE may affect immature mast cells, altering the balance of host susceptibility and resistance to schistosomes.

TI Molecular identification of blood-meal sources in Culiseta melanura and
   Culiseta morsitans from an endemic focus of eastern equine encephalitis
   virus in New York
AB Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus perpetuates in an enzootic cycle involving ornithophilic mosquito vectors, principally Culiseta melanura (Coquillett) and avian amplification hosts. To better understand the role of Cs. melanura and Culiseta morsitans (Theobald) in the epizootiology of EEE virus, we collected blood-fed mosquitoes between 31 May and 15 October 2004 at two sites associated with an EEE virus focus in central New York and identified the source of vertebrate blood by nucleotide sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of the cytochrome b gene. Analysis of 484 Cs. melanura and 122 Cs. morsitans revealed that 94.2% and 86.9%, respectively, acquired blood solely from avian hosts. Blood meals derived exclusively from mammals were detected in 0.8% of Cs. melanura and 1.6% of Cs. morsitans. Individual mosquitoes containing mixed-blood meals from both avian and mammalian hosts were also detected in 5.0% of Cs. melanura and 11.5% of Cs. morsitans. Wood thrush constituted the most common vertebrate host for Cs. melanura (23.6%) and Cs. morsitans (30.9%), followed by American robin, song sparrow, ovenbird, red-eyed vireo, and common yellowthroat. Mammalian-derived blood meals were identified as white-tailed deer, horse, domestic cat, and eastern pipistrelle bat. There were three isolations of EEE virus from Cs. melanura and one from Cs. morsitans. These results suggest that wood thrush and a few other passerine birds may play key roles in supporting EEE virus transmission in the northeast and possibly throughout the geographic range of EEE in North America. The frequency of mammalian feedings also suggests that Cs. melanura and Cs. morsitans may play a role in the transmission of EEE virus to equines, in addition to maintaining enzootic transmission among avian hosts. We report the first isolation of arboviruses from mosquito vectors concomitant with the identifications of their blood meal sources.

TI The role of ecotones in emerging infectious diseases
AB Recognition of the significance of the boundary between ecological systems, often referred to as the ecotone, has a long history in the ecological sciences and in zoonotic disease research. More recent research in landscape ecology has produced an expanded view of ecotones and elaboration of their characteristics and functions in ecosystems. Parallel research on emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and the causes of increased rates of pathogen transmission, spread, and adaptation suggests a correspondence between ecotonal processes and the ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for zoonotic and vector-borne emerging infections. A review of the literature suggests that ecotones play a role in a number of the most important EIDs. Yet these are the only diseases for which specific landscape ecological information exists in the literature or disease reports. However, the similar disease ecologies of these with about half of the approximately 130 zoonotic EIDs suggests ecotones, particularly their anthropogenic origination or modification, may be generally associated with ecotones and the global trend of increasing EIDs.

This has led to concern that ibis may transmit pathogens that threaten public health or food production. Here we report results from a study of ibis viral serology and bacterial culture that indicate that ibis are hosts of zoonotic and livestock pathogens such as Salmonella spp., Newcastle disease virus, avian influenza virus, and flaviviruses in Australia. We also performed a behavioral study to measure contact rates among ibis, people, and livestock that determine the potential for disease transmission.

TI Parasitological consequences of overcrowding in protected areas
AB For the past several years, there has been growing interest in understanding the dynamics of parasites in ecosystems, as well as the diversity of ways in which they interfere with conservation and health preoccupations. Although it is widely recognized that many conservation practices (e.g., wildlife translocations, species removal, food supplementation) may be associated with parasite-related problems, less attention has been devoted to exploring the parasitological consequences of the overcrowding of animals in protected wildlife areas. Here, we discuss this important ecological/epidemiological problem, presenting at the same time an over-view of the main questions and challenges in this field. Using empirical and theoretical examples chosen from the literature, we focus particularly on the interactions between the overcrowding of free living species and parasite population dynamics, the evolution of parasite virulence, the indirect effects on the structure of invertebrate communities, as well as the nutritional value of prey species. We argue that conservation policies should be aware more than ever of this problem, especially given the serious health risks currently posed by the spread of virulent viruses (e.g., avian influenza).

TI Spatial spread of an emerging infectious disease: Conjunctivitis in
   house finches
AB In this paper we quantify the rate of spread of the newly emerged pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum of the House Finch, Carpodacus mexicanus, in its introduced range. We compare and contrast the rapid, yet decelerating, rate of spread of the pathogen with the slower, yet accelerating rate of spread of the introduced host. Comparing the rate of spread of this pathogen to pathogens in terrestrial mammalian hosts, we see that elevation and factors relating to host abundance restrict disease spread, rather than finding any major effects of discrete barriers or anthropogenic movement. We examine the role of seasonality in the rate of spread, finding that the rate and direction of disease spread relates more to seasonality in host movement than to seasonality in disease prevalence. We conclude that asymptomatic carriers are major transmitters of Mycoplasma gallisepticum into novel locations, a finding which may also be true for many other diseases, such as West Nile Virus and avian influenza.

TI A molecular epidemiological study of rabies in Cuba
AB To investigate the emergence and current situation of terrestrial rabies in Cuba, a collection of rabies virus specimens was employed for genetic characterization. These data supported the monophyletic nature of all terrestrial rabies viruses presently circulating in Cuba but additionally delineated several distinct variants exhibiting limited spatial distribution which may reflect the history of rabies spread on the island. The strain of rabies currently circulating in Cuba, which emerged on the island in the early 20th century, has very close evolutionary ties to the Mexican dog type and is a member of the cosmopolitan lineage widely distributed during the colonial period. The Cuban rabies viruses, which circulate predominantly within the mongoose population, are phylogenetically distant from viruses circulating in mongooses in other parts of the world. These studies illustrate, at a global level, the adaptation of multiple strains of rabies to mongoose species which should be regarded as important wildlife hosts for rabies re-emergence. Given the recent emergence of human cases due to bat contact in Cuba, this study also included a single insectivorous bat specimen which was found to most closely resemble the rabies viruses known to circulate in Mexican vampire bats.

TI HIV-1 infection of mononuclear phagocytic cells: the case for bacterial
   innate immune deficiency in AIDS
AB HIV-1 infection of mononuclear phagocytic cells, comprising monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, has been the subject of extensive research over the past 20 years. The roles of mononuclear phagocytic cells in transmission of HIV-1 infection and as reservoirs of actively replicating virus have received particular attention. Experimental data have also accumulated about the effects of HIV-1 on the physiological function of mononuclear phagocytic cells, particularly their role in innate immunity to bacteria. The effects of HIV-1 on bacterial innate immune responses by mononuclear phagocytic cells are discussed here together with reports of direct interactions between HIV-encoded products and bacterial innate immune signalling pathways. These reports demonstrate mechanisms for HIV-mediated disruption of innate immune responses by mononuclear phagocytic cells that could provide novel therapeutic targets in HIV-infected patients. The clinical urgency is highlighted by greatly increased risk of invasive bacterial disease in this population, even in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV-mediated injury to bacterial innate immunity provides an experimental paradigm that could broaden our overall understanding of innate immunity and be used to study responses to pathogens other than bacteria.

TI Comparative phylogeography of unglaciated eastern North America
AB Regional phylogeographical studies involving co-distributed animal and plant species have been conducted for several areas, most notably for Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America. Until recently, phylogeographical studies in unglaciated eastern North America have been largely limited to animals. As more studies emerge for diverse lineages (including plants), it seems timely to assess the phylogeography across this region: (i) comparing and contrasting the patterns seen in plants and animals; (ii) assessing the extent of pseudocongruence; and (iii) discussing the potential applications of regional phylogeography to issues in ecology, such as response to climatic change. Unglaciated eastern North America is a large, geologically and topographically complex area with the species examined having diverse distributions. Nonetheless, some recurrent patterns emerge: (i) maritime - Atlantic vs. Gulf Coast; (ii) Apalachicola River discontinuity; (iii) Tombigbee River discontinuity; (iv) the Appalachian Mountain discontinuity; (v) the Mississippi River discontinuity; and (vi) the Apalachicola River and Mississippi River discontinuities. Although initially documented in animals, most of these patterns are also apparent in plants, providing support for phylogeographical generalizations. These patterns may generally be attributable to isolation and differentiation during Pleistocene glaciation, but in some cases may be older (Pliocene). Molecular studies sometimes agree with longstanding hypotheses of glacial refugia, but also suggest additional possible refugia, such as the southern Appalachian Mountains and areas close to the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Many species exhibit distinct patterns that reflect the unique, rather than the shared, aspects of species' phylogeographical histories. Furthermore, similar modern phylogeographical patterns can result from different underlying causal factors operating at different times (i.e. pseudocongruence). One underemphasized component of pseudocongruence may result from the efforts of researchers to categorize patterns visually - similar patterns may, in fact, not fully coincide, and inferring agreement may obscure the actual patterns and lead to erroneous conclusions. Our modelling analyses indicate no clear spatial patterning and support the hypothesis that phylogeographical structure in diverse temperate taxa is complex and was not shaped by just a few barriers.

AB Squids from the genus Euprymna (Cephalopoda: Sepiolidae) and their symbiotic bacteria Vibrio fischeri form a mutualism in which vibrios inhabit a complex light organ within the squid host. A host-mediated daily expulsion event seeds surrounding seawater with symbiotically capable V. fischeri that environmentally colonize newly hatched axenic Euprymna juveniles. Competition experiments using native and non-native Vibrio have shown that this expulsion/re-colonization phenomenon has led to cospeciation in this system in the Pacific Ocean; however, the genetic architecture of these symbiotic populations has not been determined. Using genetic diversity and nested clade analyses we have examined the variation and history of three allopatric Euprymna squid species (E. scolopes of Hawaii, E. hyllebergi of Thailand, and E. tasmanica from Australia) and their respective Vibrio symbionts. Euprymna populations appear to be very genetically distinct from each other, exhibiting little or no migration over large geographical distances. In contrast, Vibrio symbiont populations contain more diverse haplotypes, suggesting both host presence and unidentified factors facilitating long-distance migration structure in Pacific Vibrio populations. Findings from this study highlight the importance of how interactions between symbiotic organisms can unexpectedly shape population structure in phylogeographical studies.

   Asia reveals an 'emergent' lineage in Japan
AB The genetic structure of populations of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in East Asia was assessed by making host range and gene sequence comparisons of 118 isolates utilizing a population genetic approach. Most, but not all, isolates collected from Brassica plants in China infected only Brassica plants, whereas those from Japan infected both Brassica and Raphanus (BR) plants. Analyses of the positions of recombination sites in five regions of the genomes (one third of the full sequence) of the many recombinant isolates were fully congruent with the results of phylogenetic analysis, and at least one recombination type pattern was shared between Chinese and Japanese populations. One lineage of nonrecombinant isolates from the basal-BR lineage was found in 2000 in Kyushu, Japan but none in China, and have since been found over the whole island. The sudden expansion of this basal-BR population was strongly supported by calculations showing the deviations from the neutral equilibrium model for the individual geographical lineages with overall lack of nucleotide diversity, and by analysis of mismatch distribution. Our study shows that the recent Chinese and Japanese TuMV isolates are part of the same population but are discrete lineages.

   tick: the effect of transmission dynamics and implications for pest
   management
AB Since its immigration in the Pacific island of New Caledonia in 1942 (i.e. about 240 tick-generations ago), the cattle tick Boophilus microplus has experienced a remarkable adaptive diversification there. In order to better understand the population factors involved, we have investigated the B. microplus population structure on that main host-species, Bos taurus. This study was based microsatellite loci and confirmed that the island colonization came along with a significant bottleneck. Knowledge on B. microplus biology led us to expect B. microplus populations to be composed of highly inbred lineages irregularly dispatched among the individual hosts belonging to the same herds. Instead, this study evidenced a weak inbreeding level and an absence of genetic differentiation within herds. Complementarily, a significant signal of isolation by distance exhibited that human-traffic of cattle does not promote high tick dispersal within the island. Finally, the tick density was found to be about a few hundreds of reproducing adults per squared kilometre, for a gene dispersal range of about a few hundred metres per tick generation. Results are discussed with regard to the evolution of new adaptive changes.

TI Public health awareness of emerging zoonotic viruses of bats: A European
   perspective
AB Bats classified in the order Chiroptera are the most abundant and widely distributed non-human mammalian species in the world. Several bat species are reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses and therefore can be a public health hazard. Lyssaviruses of different genotypes have emerged from bats in America (Genotype 1 rabies virus; RABV), Europe (European bat lyssavirus; EBLV), and Australia (Australian bat lyssavirus; ABLV), whereas Nipah virus is the most important recent zoonosis of bat origin in Asia. Furthermore, some insectivorous bat species may be important reservoirs of SARS coronavirus, whereas Ebola virus has been detected in some megachiropteran fruit bats. Thus far, European bat lyssavirus (EBLV) is the only zoonotic virus that has been detected in bats in Europe. New zoonotic viruses may emerge from bat reservoirs and known ones may spread to a wider geographical range. To assess future threats posed by zoonotic viruses of bats, there is a need for accurate knowledge of the factors underlying disease emergence, for an effective surveillance programme, and for a rapid response system. In Europe, primary efforts should be focussed on the implementation of effective passive and active surveillance systems for EBLVs in the Serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, and Myotis species (i.e., M. daubentonii and M. dasycneme) Apart from that, detection methods for zoonotic viruses that may emerge from bats should be implemented. Analyses of data from surveillance studies can shed more light on the dynamics of bat viruses, (i.e., population persistence of viruses in bats). Subsequently, studies will have to be performed to assess the public health hazards of such viruses (i.e., infectivity and risk of infection to people).

TI Confined animal feeding operations as amplifiers of influenza
AB Influenza pandemics occur when a novel. influenza strain, often of animal origin, becomes transmissible between humans. Domestic animal species such as poultry or swine in confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) could serve as local amplifiers for such a new strain of influenza. A mathematical model is used to examine the transmission dynamics of a new influenza virus among three sequentially linked populations: the CAFO species, the CAFO workers (the bridging population), and the rest of the local human population. Using parameters based on swine data, simulations showed that when CAFO workers comprised 15-45% of the community, human influenza cases increased by 42-86%. Successful vaccination of at least 50% of CAFO workers cancelled the amplification. A human influenza epidemic due to a new virus could be locally amplified by the presence of confined animal feeding operations in the community. Thus vaccination of CAFO workers would be an effective use of a pandemic vaccine.

TI Tick-borne encephalitis virus in Clethrionomys glareolus in the Czech
   Republic
AB A total of 474 specimens from 157 rodents caught at the military training area of Boletice in the south of the Czech Republic from May to November 1999 were screened for TBEV by nested PCR. TBEV-specific RNA was amplified from lung, kidney, and spleen derived from one Clethrionomys glareolus in the first RT-PCR round. Sequence analysis revealed a 100% identity to the TBEV strain Neudoerfl. TBEV presence in the sample was confirmed by mouse brain passage of backup samples and cell culture. The results support the observation that hantaviruses and TBEV transmission can occur sympatrically in the same rodent population.

TI Pathogens, density dependence and the coexistence of tropical trees
AB There is increasing interest in the role played by density-dependent mortality from natural enemies, particularly plant pathogens, in promoting the coexistence and diversity of tropical trees. Here, we review four issues in the analysis of pathogen-induced density dependence that have been overlooked or inadequately addressed. First, the methodology for detecting density dependence must be robust to potential biases. Observational studies, in particular, require a careful analysis to avoid biases generated by measurement error, and existing studies could be criticized on these grounds. Experimental studies manipulating plant density and pathogen incidence will often be preferable, or should be run in parallel. Second, the form of density dependence is not well understood and, in particular, there are no data indicating whether pathogens cause compensating or overcompensating density responses. Owing to this, we argue that the potential for pathogen-induced density dependence to generate diversity-enhancing outcomes, such as the Janzen-Connell effect, remains uncertain, as coexistence is far more probable if density dependence is overcompensating. Third, there have been few studies examining the relative importance of intra- or interspecific density dependence resulting from pathogens (or, more widely, natural enemies). This is essentially equivalent to asking to what extent pathogens are host-specific. If pathogens are generalists, then mortality rates will respond to overall plant density, irrespective of plant species identity. This will weaken the intraspecific density dependence and reduce the diversity-promoting effects of pathogens. Finally, we highlight the need for studies that integrate observations and experiments on pathogens and density dependence into the whole life cycle of trees, because as yet it is not possible to be certain of the degree to which pathogens contribute to observed dynamics.

TI Global phylogeographic limits of Hawaii's avian malaria
AB The introduction of avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) to Hawaii has provided a model system for studying the influence of exotic disease on naive host populations. Little is known, however, about the origin or the genetic variation of Hawaii's malaria and traditional classification methods have confounded attempts to place the parasite within a global ecological and evolutionary context. Using fragments of the parasite mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and the nuclear gene dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase obtained from a global survey of greater than 13 000 avian samples, we show that Hawaii's avian malaria, which can cause high mortality and is a major limiting factor for many species of native passerines, represents just one of the numerous lineages composing the morphological parasite species. The single parasite lineage detected in Hawaii exhibits a broad host distribution worldwide and is dominant on several other remote oceanic islands, including Bermuda and Moorea, French Polynesia. The rarity of this lineage in the continental New World and the restriction of closely related lineages to the Old World suggest limitations to the transmission of reproductively isolated parasite groups within the morphological species.

TI Human cytolytic T cell recognition of Yersinia pestis virulence proteins
   that target innate immune responses
AB Cell contact by the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis initiates the injection of several virulence factors that target biochemical pathways critical for host clearance of bacteria. Despite this impairment of innate immunity, it is unclear whether antigen recognition by T cells is equally affected. We present evidence that human cytolytic T cells respond to Y. pestis virulence proteins presented by infected monocytes and dendritic cells. These T cell antigens consisted of a panel of proteins encoded by pCD1, a 70-kDa plasmid that harbors virulence factors and transport proteins of the cell contact-dependent, type III secretion system. Infected cells retained the ability to process and present tetanus toxoid to T cells, which indicates that responses to unrelated antigens were also maintained. Our results indicate that T cell immunity remains functional during Y. pestis infection, which thus suggests the potential benefits of therapeutic vaccination and strategies that emphasize the inclusion of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses.

TI How do pathogen evolution and host heterogeneity interact in disease
   emergence?
AB Heterogeneity in the parameters governing the spread of infectious diseases is a common feature of real-world epidemics. It has been suggested that for pathogens with basic reproductive number R-0 > 1, increasing heterogeneity makes extinction of disease more likely during the early rounds of transmission. The basic reproductive number R-0 of the introduced pathogen may, however, be less than 1 after the introduction, and evolutionary changes are then required for R-0 to increase to above 1 and the pathogen to emerge. In this paper, we consider how host heterogeneity influences the emergence of both non-evolving pathogens and those that must undergo adaptive changes to spread in the host population. In contrast to previous results, we find that heterogeneity does not always make extinction more likely and that if adaptation is required for emergence, the effect of host heterogeneity is relatively small. We discuss the application of these ideas to vaccination strategies.

TI Mosquitoes do senesce: Departure from the paradigm of constant mortality
AB Although variation in mortality is considered by virtually all vector-borne disease specialists to be one of the most important determinants of an arthropod's capacity to transmit pathogens, the operational assumption often is that insect vector mortality is independent of age. Acceptance of the non-senescence assumption leads to the erroneous conclusion that mosquito age is unimportant, results in misleading predictions regarding disease reductions after vector control, and represses study of other aspects of mosquito biology that change with age. We brought large-scale laboratory life table techniques (N > 100,000) to bear on the question of age-dependent mortality in the mosquito vector of dengue virus, Aedes aegypti. Mortality was highly age dependent in both sexes. Mortality was low at young ages (< 10 days old), steadily increased at middle ages, and decelerated at older ages. A newly derived age-dependent model of pathogen transmission shows the importance of young mosquitoes and population age structure to transmission dynamics. Departure from the age-independent mortality paradigm encourages research on overlooked complexities in mosquito biology, the need for innovative methods to study mosquito population dynamics, and the need to study age-dependent changes for an accurate understanding of mosquito biology and pathogen transmission.

TI Infection with hepatitis C virus among health care workers in the
   Brazilian western Amazon region (Rio Branco, state of Acre)
AB Clinical and epidemiologic studies on the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the western Brazilian Amazon region are scarce. However, reports of clinical cases of hepatitis or pathologies associated to the HCV infection are frequent. In the state of Acre, there have been no studies on the population with the greatest exposure to parenteral transmission of virus infection. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of HCV infection among health care workers (HCWs) in this region. Of 2,338 HCWs, 646 were randomly selected for this study. The presence of antibody to HCV was determined. If these persons were antibody positive, they were tested for HCV RNA and the viral genotype was determined. The seroprevalence of antibody to HCV was 4.8% (31 of 646), and 3.7% (24 of 646) of those tested had detectable HCV RNA. Among these 24 viremic cases, HCV genotype 1 was most common (n = 16), followed by genotypes 3 (n = 6), 2 (n = 1), and an unidentified genotype. Infection with HCV (identified by a polymerase chain reaction) was more frequent among those with lower educational levels and lower incomes, those who lived for a longer period in the city of Rio Branco, those who reported intravenous use of vitamin complexes, those with a history of dental treatment, those with alcoholism, and women with history of caesarian parturition. The high prevalence of patients with HCV observed among HCWs in the city of Rio Branco and risk factors indicate the need for prevention and control programs, in addition to assistance programs, because this region is also hyperendemic for hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus.

TI Maternal modulation of natal dispersal in a passerine bird: An adaptive
   strategy to cope with parasitism?
AB The decision of how far to disperse from the natal territory has profound and long-lasting consequences for young animals, yet the optimal dispersal behavior often depends on environmental factors that are difficult or impossible to assess by inexperienced juveniles. Natural selection thus favors mechanisms that allow the adaptive and flexible adjustment of the offspring's dispersal behavior by their parents via either paternal or maternal effects. Here we show that different dispersal strategies maximize the reproductive success of young great tits (Parus major) originating from a parasite-infested or a parasite-free nest and demonstrate that differential transfer of maternal yolk androgens in response to parasitism can result in a modification of the offspring's dispersal behavior that appears adaptive. It demonstrates that prenatal maternal effects are an important yet so far neglected determinant of natal dispersal and highlights the potential importance of maternal effects in mediating coevolutionary processes in host-parasite systems.

Why Ebola has emerged so explosively remains poorly understood. Previous studies have tended to focus on exogenous factors such as habitat disturbance and climate change as drivers of Ebola emergence while downplaying the contribution of transmission between gorilla or chimpanzee social groups. Here we report recent observations on behaviors that pose a risk of transmission among gorilla groups and between gorillas and chimpanzees. These observations support a reassessment of ape-to-ape transmission as an amplifier of Ebola outbreaks.

TI Predation can increase the prevalence of infectious disease
AB Many host-pathogen interactions are embedded in a web of other interspecific interactions. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that reductions in predator abundance can indirectly lead to upsurges in infectious diseases harbored by prey populations. In this note, we use simple models to show that in some circumstances, predation can actually increase the equilibrial prevalence of infection in a host, where prevalence is defined as the fraction of host population that is infected. Our results show that there is no complete generalization possible about how shifts in predation pressure translate into shifts in infection levels, without some understanding of host population regulation and the role of acquired immunity. Our results further highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of nonregulatory pathogens in reservoir host populations and the understudied effects of demographic costs incurred by individuals that survive infection and develop acquired immunity.

TI Rapid evolution and ecological host-parasite dynamics
AB Traditionally, the termination of parasite epidemics has been attributed to ecological causes: namely, the depletion of susceptible hosts as a result of mortality or acquired immunity. Here, we suggest that epidemics can also end because of rapid host evolution. Focusing on a particular host-parasite system, Daphnia dentifera and its parasite Metschnikowia bicuspidata, we show that Daphnia from lakes with recent epidemics were more resistant to infection and had less variance in susceptibility than Daphnia from lakes without recent epidemics. However, our studies revealed little evidence for genetic variation in infectivity or virulence in Metschnikowia. Incorporating the observed genetic variation in host susceptibility into an epidemiological model parameterized for this system reveals that rapid evolution can explain the termination of epidemics on time scales matching what occurs in lake populations. Thus, not only does our study provide rare evidence for parasite-mediated selection in natural populations, it also suggests that rapid evolution has important effects on short-term host-parasite dynamics.

TI Wildlife, exotic pets, and emerging zoonoses
AB Most emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic; wildlife constitutes a large and often unknown reservoir. Wildlife can also be a source for reemergence of previously controlled zoonoses. Although the discovery of such zoonoses is often related to better diagnostic tools, the leading causes of their emergence are human behavior and modifications to natural habitats (expansion of human populations and their encroachment on wildlife habitat), changes in agricultural practices, and globalization of trade. However, other factors include wildlife trade and translocation, live animal and bushmeat markets, consumption of exotic foods, development of ecotourism, access to petting zoos, and ownership of exotic pets. To reduce risk for emerging zoonoses, the public should be educated about the risks associated with wildlife, bushmeat, and exotic pet trades; and proper surveillance systems should be implemented.

TI Host life span and the evolution of resistance characteristics
AB There is a wide variety of resistance mechanisms that hosts may evolve in response to their parasites. These can be functionally classified as avoidance (lower probability of becoming infected), recovery (faster rate of clearance), tolerance (reduced death rate when infected), or acquired immunity. It is commonly thought that longer lived organisms should invest more in costly resistance. We show that due to epidemiological feedbacks the situation is often more complex. Using evolutionary theory we examine how the optimal investment in costly resistance varies with life span in a broad range of scenarios. In the absence of acquired immunity, longer lived populations do generally invest more in resistance. If hosts have acquired immunity, the optimal resistance may either increase or decrease with increasing life span. in addition, there may be evolutionary bistability with high and low investments in avoidance or tolerance. The optimal investment in the duration of acquired immunity always increases with life span, and due to bistability, shorter lived hosts may commonly not evolve any immunity. In contrast, the optimal investment in the probability of acquiring immunity initially increases and then decreases with life span. Our results have important implications for the evolution of invertebrate and vertebrate immunity, and for the evolution of acquired immunity itself.

TI Phylogenetic evidence of host-specific cryptic species in the anther
   smut fungus
AB Cryptic structure of species complexes confounds an accurate accounting of biological diversity in natural systems. Also, cryptic sibling species often become specialized to different ecological conditions, for instance, with host specialization by cryptic parasite species. The fungus Microbotryum violaceum causes anther smut disease in plants of Caryophyllaceae, and the degree of specialization and gene flow between strains on different hosts have been controversial in the literature. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses on M. violaceum from 23 host species and different geographic origins using three single-copy nuclear genes (beta-tub, gamma-tub, and Ef1 alpha). Congruence between the phylogenies identified several lineages that evolved independently for a long time. The lineages had overlapping geographic ranges but were highly specialized on different hosts. These results thus suggest that M. violaceum is a complex of highly specialized sibling species. Two incongruencies between the individual gene phylogenies and one intragene recombination event were detected at basal nodes, suggesting ancient introgression events or speciation events via hybridizations. However, incongruencies and recombination were not detected among terminal branches, indicating that the potentials for cross-infection and experimental hybridization are often not sufficient to suggest that introgressions would likely persist in nature.

TI Specialization and local adaptation of a fungal parasite on two host
   plant species as revealed by two fitness traits
AB We investigate the geographic pattern of adaptation of a fungal parasite, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, on two host species, Phaseolus vulgaris and P coccineus for two parasite fitness traits: infectivity (ability to attack a host individual) and aggressivity (degree of sporulation and leaf surface damage). Using a cross-inoculation experiment, we show specialization of the fungus on its host species of origin for both traits even when fungi, which originated from hosts growing in sympatry, were tested on sympatric host populations. Within the two host species, we compared infectivity and aggressivity on local versus allopatric plant-fungus combinations. We found evidence for local adaptation for the two traits on P vulgaris but not on P coccineus. There was no significant correlation between the degrees of local adaptation for infectivity and aggressivity, indicating that the genetic basis and the effect of selection may differ between these two traits. For the two fitness traits, a positive correlation between the degree of specialization and the degree of local adaptation was found, suggesting that specialization can be reinforced by local adaptation.

TI Advice of the rose: Experimental coevolution of a trematode parasite and
   its snail host
AB Understanding host-parasite coevolution requires multigenerational studies in which changes in both parasite infectivity and host susceptibility are monitored. We conducted a coevolution experiment that examined six generations of interaction between a freshwater snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) and one of its common parasites (the sterilizing trematode, Microphallus sp.). In one treatment (recycled), the parasite was reintroduced into the same population of host snails. In the second treatment (lagged), the host snails received parasites from the recycled treatment, but the addition of these parasites did not begin until the second generation. Hence any parasite-mediated genetic changes of the host in the lagged treatment were expected to be one generation behind those in the recycled treatment. The lagged treatment thus allowed us to test for time lags in parasite adaptation, as predicted by the Red Queen model of host-parasite coevolution. Finally, in the third treatment (control), parasites were not added. The results showed that parasites from the recycled treatment were significantly more infective to snails from the lagged treatment than from the recycled treatment. In addition, the hosts from the recycled treatment diverged from the control hosts with regard to their susceptibility to parasites collected from the field. Taken together, the results are consistent with time lagged, frequency-dependent selection and rapid coevolution between hosts and parasites.

TI Temporal dynamics and diversity of avian malaria parasites in a single
   host species
AB We have used molecular methods to unravel a remarkable diversity of parasite lineages in a long-term population study of great reed warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus that was not foreseen from traditional microscopic examination of blood smears. This diversity includes eight Haemoproteus and 10 Plasmodium lineages of which most probably represent good biological species.
   Contrary to expectation, the relative frequency of parasite lineages seemed not to change over the 17-year study period and we found no effects of the parasites on a male secondary sexual ornament (song repertoire size) and two measures of fitness (adult survival and production of recruited offspring).
   We discuss whether the absence of fitness consequences of the parasites might relate to the fact that we have studied the host at the breeding sites in Europe, whereas the transmission seems to take place at the wintering sites in Africa, where the naive birds encounter the parasites for the first time and the resulting primary infections likely make them sicker than during the chronic phase of the infection.
   The prevalence of the three most common lineages appeared to fluctuate in parallel with a periodicity of approximately 3-4 years. Theoretical models based on intrinsic interactions between parasite antigen and host immune genes cannot explain such dynamics, suggesting that knowledge of extrinsic parameters such as vector distribution and alternative hosts are required to understand these patterns.

TI Parasite survey of a Daphnia hybrid complex: host-specificity and
   environment determine infection
AB Hybridization between species is a common phenomenon in plants and animals. If parasite prevalence differs for hybrids and parental species (i.e. taxa) there may be considerable consequences for relative hybrid fitness. Some studies have investigated hybrid complexes for infection, and complex-specific differences in parasite prevalence have been detected.
   Based on the results of a field study on a hybridizing Daphnia population from a single lake, it has been hypothesized that permanently over- or under-infected hybrids do not exist. The observed field-patterns can only be temporal because taxa, in addition to single genotypes, might be the subject of parasite driven host frequency-dependent selection. Thus, parasites will track any common taxon within a hybrid complex.
   In the present study, hybridizing Daphnia populations from 43 lakes were screened for parasite infections to obtain indirect evidence for coevolutionary cycles. It was hypothesized that, due to time lags between the evolution of resistance in host populations and the evolution of the parasite towards tracking of a common host taxon, the same Daphnia taxon will be over-infected in some lakes, while being under-infected in others.
   Two of the four parasite species were specialists: their prevalence differed among coexisting Daphnia taxa. The varying infection patterns detected across spatially segregated hybridizing Daphnia populations are consistent with theoretical predictions for coevolutionary cycles. Thus the infection patterns, as observed under natural conditions, are temporal and unstable.
   Additionally, the spatial distribution of the four parasite species was analysed with respect to habitat differences. The results show that the presence of a particular parasite on a host taxon was determined not only by the host-specificity of the parasite, but also by host-habitat relations.

TI Dose-dependent schistosome-induced mortality and morbidity risk elevates
   host reproductive effort
AB Parasitism changes the host environment and may influence resource allocation between reproductive effort and somatic maintenance. We characterized the impact of dose-dependent schistosome exposure and/or infection establishment on intermediate host survival and reproduction. Four matched groups of Biomphalaria glabrata snails were individually exposed to increasing doses of Schistosoma mansoni parasites, with a fifth control group remaining unexposed. Increased mortality was observed amongst both snails infected and also those snails exposed to the parasite but within which infection did not establish, although only exposed but uninfected snails showed a dose-dependent increase in mortality. Snails also facultatively altered their reproductive output in response to parasite exposure: egg mass production decreased with increasing parasite dose in patently infected snails, whilst, in contrast, exposed but uninfected snails demonstrated a positive association between egg mass production and parasite dose in the post-patent period. These results uniquely suggest an exposure-dose-dependent post-patent fecundity compensation occurring in relation to the risk of future parasite-associated mortality.

TI Host inbreeding increases susceptibility to ectoparasitism
AB Inbreeding, which increases homozygosity throughout the genome by increasing the proportion of alleles that are identical by descent, is expected to compromise resistance against parasitism. Here, we demonstrate that host inbreeding increases susceptibility to ectoparasitism in a natural fruit fly (Drosophila nigrospiracula) - mite (Macrocheles subbadius) association, and that this effect depends on host genetic background. Moreover, flies generated from reciprocal crosses between susceptible inbred lines exhibited elevated levels of resistance similar to that in the mass-bred base population, confirming in reverse direction the causative link between expected heterozygosity and resistance. We also show that inbreeding reduces the host's ability to sustain energetically expensive behaviours, and that host exhaustion dramatically increases susceptibility. These findings suggest that inbreeding depression for resistance results from an inability to sustain defensive behaviours because of compromised physiological competence.

TI Dynamics of the evolution of Batesian mimicry: molecular phylogenetic
   analysis of ant-mimicking Myrmarachne (Araneae : Salticidae) species and
   their ant models
AB Batesian mimicry is seen as an example of evolution by natural selection, with predation as the main driving force. The mimic is under selective pressure to resemble its model, whereas it is disadvantageous for the model to be associated with the palatable mimic. In consequence one might expect there to be an evolutionary arms race, similar to the one involving host-parasite coevolution. In this study, the evolutionary dynamics of a Batesian mimicry system of model ants and ant-mimicking salticids is investigated by comparing the phylogenies of the two groups. Although Batesian mimics are expected to coevolve with their models, we found the phylogenetic patterns of the models and the mimics to be indicative of adaptive radiation by the mimic rather than co-speciation between the mimic and the model. This shows that there is strong selection pressure on Myrmarachne, leading to a high degree of polymorphism. There is also evidence of sympatric speciation in Myrmarachne, the reproductive isolation possibly driven by female mate choice in polymorphic species.

TI HIV in prison in low-income and middle-income countries
AB High prevalence of HIV infection and the over-representation of injecting drug users (IDUs) in prisons combined with HIV risk behaviour create a crucial public-health issue for correctional institutions and, at a broader level, the communities in which they are situated. However, data relevant to this problem are limited and difficult to access. We reviewed imprisonment, HIV prevalence, and the proportion of prisoners who are IDUs in 152 low-income and middle-income countries. Information on imprisonment was obtained for 142 countries. Imprisonment rates ranged from 23 per 100000 population in Burkina Faso to 532 per 100000 in Belarus and Russia. Information on HIV prevalence in prisons was found for 75 countries. Prevalence was greater than 10% in prisons in 20 countries. Eight countries reported prevalence of IDUs in prison of greater than 10%. HIV prevalence among IDU prisoners was reported in eight countries and was greater than 10% in seven of those. Evidence of HIV transmission in prison was found for seven low-income and middle-income countries. HIV is a serious problem for many countries, especially where injection drug use occurs. Because of the paucity of data available, the contribution of HIV within prison settings is difficult to determine in many low-income and middle-income countries. Systematic collection of data to inform HIV prevention strategies in prison is urgently needed. The introduction and evaluation of HIV prevention strategies in prisons are warranted.

TI High intercontinental migration rates and population admixture in the
   sapstain fungus Ophiostoma ips
AB Ophiostoma ips is a common fungal associate of various conifer-infesting bark beetles in their native ranges and has been introduced into non-native pine plantations in the Southern Hemisphere. In this study, we used 10 microsatellite markers to investigate the population biology of O. ips in native (Cuba, France, Morocco and USA) and non-native (Australia, Chile and South Africa) areas to characterize host specificity, reproductive behaviour, and the potential origin as well as patterns of spread of the fungus and its insect vectors. The markers resolved a total of 41 alleles and 75 haplotypes. Higher genetic diversity was found in the native populations than in the introduced populations. Based on the origin of the insect vectors, the populations of O. ips in Australia would be expected to reflect a North American origin, and those in Chile and South Africa to reflect a European origin. However, most alleles observed in the native European population were also found in the native North American population; only the allele frequencies among the populations varied. This admixture made it impossible to confirm the origin of the introduced Southern Hemisphere (SH) populations of O. ips. There was also no evidence for specificity of the fungus to particular bark beetle vectors or hosts. Although O. ips is thought to be mainly self-fertilizing, evidence for recombination was found in the four native populations surveyed. The higher genetic diversity in the North American than in the European population suggests that North America could be the possible source region of O. ips.

Individual snails harboured one to five trematode genotypes and 48% of snails were infected by multiple parasite genotypes. Overall, the number of parasite genotypes did not increase with snail size, but was highest in intermediate-sized snails. Significantly larger numbers of parasite genotypes were detected in crabs (relative to snails; P < 0.001), with 16-25 genotypes recovered from individual crabs. Although crabs are typically infected by small numbers of cercariae sourced from many snails, they are occasionally infected by large numbers of cercariae sourced from single snails. The latter cases explain the significant genetic differentiation of trematode populations detected among their crab hosts (F(ST) = 0.009, P < 0.001). Our results suggest that the timing of infection and/or intraspecific competition among parasite clones within snails determine(s) the diversity of parasite clones that snails harbour. The presence of a large number of infected snails and tidal mixing of cercariae prior to infection results in crabs potentially harbouring hundreds of parasite genotypes despite the crabs' territorial behaviour.

TI Evolutionary interactions between N-linked glycosylation sites in the
   HIV-1 envelope
AB The addition of asparagine (N)-linked polysaccharide chains (i.e., glycans) to the gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope is not only required for correct protein folding, but also may provide protection against neutralizing antibodies as a "glycan shield." As a result, strong host-specific selection is frequently associated with codon positions where nonsynonymous substitutions can create or disrupt potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs). Moreover, empirical data suggest that the individual contribution of PNGSs to the neutralization sensitivity or infectivity of HIV-1 may be critically dependent on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the envelope sequence. Here we evaluate how glycan-glycan interactions have shaped the evolution of HIV-1 envelope sequences by analyzing the distribution of PNGSs in a large-sequence alignment. Using a "covarion"- type phylogenetic model, we find that the rates at which individual PNGSs are gained or lost vary significantly over time, suggesting that the selective advantage of having a PNGS may depend on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the sequence. Consequently, we identify specific interactions between PNGSs in the alignment using a new paired-character phylogenetic model of evolution, and a Bayesian graphical model. Despite the fundamental differences between these two methods, several interactions are jointly identified by both. Mapping these interactions onto a structural model of HIV-1 gp120 reveals that negative (exclusive) interactions occur significantly more often between colocalized glycans, while positive (inclusive) interactions are restricted to more distant glycans. Our results imply that the adaptive repertoire of alternative configurations in the HIV-1 glycan shield is limited by functional interactions between the N-linked glycans. This represents a potential vulnerability of rapidly evolving HIV-1 populations that may provide useful glycan-based targets for neutralizing antibodies.

TI Increased genetic diversity as a defence against parasites is undermined
   by social parasites: Microdon mutabilis hoverflies infesting Formica
   lemani ant colonies
AB Genetic diversity can benefit social insects by providing variability in immune defences against parasites and pathogens. However, social parasites of ants infest colonies and not individuals, and for them a different relationship between genetic diversity and resistance may exist. Here, we investigate the genetic variation, assessed using up to 12 microsatellite loci, of workers in 91 Formica lemani colonies in relation to their infestation by the specialist social parasite Microdon mutabilis. At the main study site, workers in infested colonies exhibited lower relatedness and higher estimated queen numbers, on average, than uninfested ones. Additionally, estimated queen numbers were negatively correlated with estimated average numbers of mates per queen within infested colonies. At another site, infested colonies also exhibited significantly lower worker relatedness, and estimated queen numbers were comparable in trend. In contrast, in two populations of F. lemani where M. mutabilis was absent, relatedness within colonies was high (40 and 90% with R > 0.6). While high genetic variation can benefit social insects by increasing their resistance to pathogens, there may be a cost in the increased likelihood of infiltration by social parasites owing to greater variation in nestmate recognition cues. This study provides the first empirical test of this hypothesis.

Weekly infection rates and number of infected Culiseta melanura captured per trap night were positively associated EEE cases (P = 0.023 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas abundance was not (P = 0.077). The infection rate for Culiseta melanura of 0.39 per 1,000 tested mosquitoes identified human cases with a sensitivity of 0.87, a specificity of 0.82, a positive predictive value of 0.14, and a negative predictive value of 0.995. Timely mosquito testing and infection rate calculation are critical for disease risk estimation and outbreak control efforts.

TI Subclinical infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in cats
AB Avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 was transmitted to domestic cats by close contact with infected birds. Virus-specific nucleic acids were detected in pharyngeal swabs from 3 of 40 randomly sampled cats from a group of 194 animals (day 8 after contact with an infected swan). All cats were transferred to a quarantine station and monitored for clinical signs, virus shedding, and antibody production until day 50. Despite unfamiliar handling, social distress, and the presence of other viral and nonviral pathogens that caused illness and poor health and compromised the immune systems, clinical signs of influenza did not develop in any of the cats. There was no evidence of horizontal transmission to other cats because antibodies against H5N1 virus developed in only 2 cats.

TI Host-associated genetic import in Campylobacter jejuni
AB Host association of Campylobacter jejuni was analyzed by using multilocus sequence typing data for 713 isolates from chickens and bovids (cattle and sheep). Commonly used summary measures of genotypes (sequence type and clonal complex) showed poor accuracy, but a method using the full allelic profile showed 80% accuracy in distinguishing isolates from these 2 host groups. We explored the biologic basis of more accurate results with allelic profiles. Strains isolated from specific hosts have imported a substantial number of alleles while circulating in those host species. These results imply that 1) although Campylobacter moves frequently between hosts, most transmission is within species, and 2) lineages can acquire a host signature and potentially adapt to the host through recombination. Assignment using this signature enables improved prediction of source for pathogens that undergo frequent genetic recombination.

TI Design and analysis of small-scale transmission experiments with animals
AB Interactions between pathogens and hosts at the population level should be considered when studying the effectiveness of control measures for infectious diseases. The advantage of doing transmission experiments compared to field studies is that they offer a controlled environment in which the effect of a single factor can be investigated, while variation due to other factors is minimized. This paper gives an overview of the biological and mathematical aspects, bottlenecks and solutions of developing and executing transmission experiments with animals. Different methods of analysis and different experimental designs are discussed. Final size methods are often used for analysing transmission data, but have never been published in a refereed journal; therefore, they will be described in detail in this paper. We hope that this information is helpful for scientists who are considering performing transmission experiments.

TI Screening strategies in surveillance and control of
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
AB With reports of hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) continuing to increase and therapeutic options decrease, infection control methods are of increasing importance. Here we investigate the relationship between surveillance and infection control. Surveillance plays two roles with respect to control: it allows detection of infected/colonized individuals necessary for their removal from the general population, and it allows quantification of control success. We develop a stochastic model of MRSA transmission dynamics exploring the effects of two screening strategies in an epidemic setting: random and on admission. We consider both hospital and community populations and include control and surveillance in a single framework. Random screening was more efficient at hospital surveillance and allowed nosocomial control, which also prevented epidemic behaviour in the community. Therefore, random screening was the more effective control strategy for both the hospital and community populations in this setting. Surveillance strategies have significant impact on both ascertainment of infection prevalence and its control.

TI A novel preference for an invasive plant as a mechanism for animal
   hybrid speciation
AB Homoploid hybrid speciation-speciation via hybridization without a change in chromosome number-is rarely documented and poorly understood in animals. In particular, the mechanisms by which animal homoploid hybrid species become ecologically and reproductively isolated from their parents are hypothetical and remain largely untested by experiments. For the many host-specific parasites that mate on their host, choosing the right host is the most important ecological and reproductive barrier between these species. One example of a host-specific parasite is the Lonicera fly, a population of tephritid fruit flies that evolved within the last 250 years likely by hybridization between two native Rhagoletis species following a host shift to invasive honeysuckle. We studied the host preference of the Lonicera fly and its putative parent species in laboratory experiments. The Lonicera fly prefers its new host, introduced honeysuckle, over the hosts of both parental species, demonstrating the rapid acquisition of preference for a new host as a means of behavioral isolation from the parent species. The parent taxa discriminate against each other's native hosts, but both accept honeysuckle fruit, leaving the potential for asymmetric gene flow from the parent species. Importantly, this pattern allows us to formulate hypotheses about the initial formation of the Lonicera fly. As mating partners from the two parent taxa are more likely to meet on invasive honeysuckle than on their respective native hosts, independent acceptance of honeysuckle by both parents likely preceded hybridization. We propose that invasive honeysuckle served as a catalyst for the local breakdown of reproductive isolation between the native parent species, a novel consequence of the introduction of an exotic weed. We describe behavioral mechanisms that explain the initial hybridization and subsequent reproductive isolation of the hybrid Lonicera fly. These results provide experimental support for a combination of host shift and hybridization as a model for hybrid speciation in parasitic animals.

TI Selection promotes organ compartmentalization in HIV-1: Evidence from
   gag and pol genes
AB The existence of organ-specific human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) populations within infected hosts has been long lasting studied. Previous work established that population subdivision by organs occurs at the envelope env gene, but less is known about other genomic regions. Here, we used a population genetics approach to detect organ compartmentalization in proviral sequences of HIV-1 gag and pol genes. Significant population structure was found in pol (100% of cases) and gag (33%) pair-wise organ comparisons. The degree of compartmentalization positively correlated with the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, and codons showing organ compartmentalization were more likely to be under significantly positive selection. This suggests that HIV-1 populations dynamically adapt to locally variable intra-host environments. In the case of pol gene, differential penetration of antiretroviral drugs might account for the observed pattern, whereas for gag gene, local selective pressures remain unexplored.

TI Polygenic traits and parasite local adaptation
AB The extent to which parasites are locally adapted to their hosts has important implications for human health and agriculture. A recently developed conceptual framework-the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution-predicts that local maladaptation should be common and largely determined by the interplay between gene flow and spatially variable reciprocal selection. Previous investigation of this theory has predominately focused on genetic systems of infection and resistance characterized by few genes of major effect and particular forms of epistasis. Here we extend existing theory by analyzing mathematical models of host-parasite interactions in which host resistance to parasites is mediated by quantitative traits with an additive polygenic basis. In contrast to previous theoretical studies predicated upon major gene mechanisms, we find that parasite local maladaptation is quite uncommon and restricted to one specific functional form of host resistance. Furthermore, our results show that local maladaptation should be rare or absent in studies that measure local adaptation using reciprocal transplant designs conducted in natural environments. Our results thus narrow the scope over which the predictions of the geographic mosaic theory are likely to hold and provide novel and readily testable predictions about when and where local maladaptation is expected.

TI Domestication of maize, sorghum, and sugarcane did not drive the
   divergence of their smut pathogens
AB We investigated two alternative hypotheses for the origin of crop pathogen species: that human-mediated agricultural practices drove the divergence of many crop plant pathogen species or that coevolutionary processes in natural populations of the crops' ancestors drove divergence of pathogen species. We distinguished between these two hypotheses by constructing a robust multigene phylogeny and estimating the dates of divergence among four, monophyletic species of smut fungi (Ustilago maydis, U. scitaminea, Sporisorium reilianum, S. sorght) known to specifically infect maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and their wild ancestors. Without a fossil record for smut fungi, we calibrated the pathogen species' divergence times to their plant host divergence times. Specifically, a calibration date of 10,000 years was employed to test the hypothesis that the fungal species originated at the time of domestication of their current hosts and a calibration date of 50 million years was employed to test the hypothesis that the fungal species originated on wild ancestors of their domesticated hosts. Substitution rates at five protein coding genes were calculated and rates obtained for the 10,000 year calibration date were orders of magnitude faster than those commonly reported for eukaryotes, thus rejecting the hypothesis that these smut pathogen species diverged at the time of domestication. In contrast, substitution rates obtained for the 50 million year calibration were comparable to eukaryotic substitution rates. We used the 50 million year calibration to estimate divergence times of taxa in two datasets, one comprised solely the focal species and one comprised the focal species and additional related taxa. Both datasets indicate that all taxa diverged millions of years ago, strongly supporting the hypothesis that smut species diverged before the time of domestication and modern agriculture. Thus, smut species diverged in the ecological context of natural host plant and fungal populations.

   medication field experiment on a wild passerine
AB 1. Very few studies to date have evaluated experimentally the effects of blood parasites on physiological variables and breeding performance in wild birds. In this study, blood parasitaemias of female Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus L. were experimentally manipulated to assess subsequent changes in immunoglobulin level and parental effort during reproduction.
   2. At the beginning of the nestling period, female Blue Tits were medicated with a high dose (HD) or a low dose (LD) of the antimalarial Primaquine, or with saline solution (control). Treatment with Primaquine causes a reduction in blood parasitaemias in the study population.
   3. Immunoglobulin levels decreased in females from the HD group during the experimental period (10 days), while the levels increased in control females.
   4. Only females in the HD group increased significantly their provisioning rates from the early to the late nestling stage. Total (male and female) provisioning rates increased significantly for the HD and LD groups, but not for the control group.
   5. Nestlings reared by control females suffered a higher infestation by the ectoparasitic blowfly Protocalliphora azurea (Fallen).
   6. Medication and the associated decrease in immunoglobulin levels allow females to allocate more resources towards parental effort. In addition, there is a potential link of medication with the health of the nestlings.
   7. This study gives indirect support to the trade-off between reproductive effort and immune defence in avian hosts, and sheds light on the evolutionary significance of the link between parasitism, immunity, life-history decisions and fitness.

AB Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a commensal bacterium from dogs' mouths, can cause septicemia or meningitis in humans through bites or scratches. Here, we describe and characterize the inflammatory response of human and mouse macrophages on C. canimorsus infection. Macrophages infected with 10 different strains failed to release tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 alpha. Macrophages infected with live and heat-killed (HK) C. canimorsus 5 (Cc5), a strain isolated from a patient with fatal septicemia, did not release IL-6, IL-8, interferon-gamma, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, and nitric oxide (NO). This absence of a proinflammatory response was characterized by the inability of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 to respond to Cc5. Moreover, live but not HK Cc5 blocked the release of TNF-alpha and NO induced by HK Yersinia enterocolitica. In addition, live Cc5 down-regulated the expression of TLR4 and dephosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results highlight passive and active mechanisms of immune evasion by C. canimorsus, which may explain its capacity to escape from the host immune system.

TI Effects of fertility control on behavior and disease transmission in
   brushtail possums
AB Fertility control is currently under development for the control of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), one of New Zealand's most serious vertebrate pests. Despite intensive research into various methods for achieving infertility, including immunocontraception and disrupting endocrine control of reproduction, researchers know little about the potential effects of these methods on the behavior of wild possums. We assessed the effects of surgically imposed sterility, either to block fertilization (tubal ligation) or to disrupt endocrine control of fertility (gonadectomy), by using radiotelemetry on the movement patterns and site fidelity of wild brushtail possums. In addition, we assessed the effect of gonadectomy on the transmission rate of a commonly occurring, directly transmitted pathogen in possums, Leptospira interrogans serovar balcanica (hereafter L. balcanica), to determine the effect of any behavioral changes on possum contact rates. Both tubal ligation and gonadectomy of females did not appear to have any appreciable effect on behavior, with sterilized females having space-use patterns and fidelity to seasonal breeding ranges similar to those of fertile females. However, gonadectomy of male possums resulted in a significant reduction of 42% and 47% in the 95% and 70% isopleth seasonal breeding ranges, respectively. Furthermore, the transmission rate of L. balcanica in gonadectomized male and female possums was reduced by 88% and 63%, respectively, compared with that in fertile male and female possums. Overall, these results suggest that fertility control, either by blocking fertilization (e.g., immunocontraception) or by disrupting endocrine control of reproduction (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone vaccines), is unlikely to have an impact on social organization and behavior of brushtail possums in ways that may compromise the efficacy of fertility control for reducing population density. However, the reduction in the transmission rate of L. balcanica indicates that fertility control that interferes with endocrine control of reproduction is likely to reduce the contact rate between possums. This could have implications for the control of other wildlife diseases requiring direct contact for transmission.

TI Effects of joint space use and group membership on contact rates among
   white-tailed deer
AB Establishment and spread of infectious diseases are controlled by the frequency of contacts among hosts. Although managers can estimate transmission coefficients from the relationship between disease prevalence and age or time, they may wish to quantify or compare contact rates before a disease is established or while it is at very low prevalence. Our objectives were to quantify direct and indirect contacts rates among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and to compare these measures of contact rate with simpler measures of joint space use. We deployed Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on 23 deer near Carbondale, Illinois, USA, from 2002 to 2005. We used location data from the GPS collars to measure pairwise rates of direct and indirect contact, based on a range of proximity criteria and time lags, as well as volume of intersection (VI) of kernel utilization distributions. We analyzed contact rates at a given distance criterion and time lag using mixed-model logistic regression. Direct contact rates increased with increasing VI and were higher in autumn-spring than in summer. After accounting for VI, the estimated odds of direct contact during autumn-spring periods were 5.0-22.1-fold greater (depending on the proximity criterion) for pairs of deer in the same social group than for between-group pairs, but for direct contacts during summer the within:between-group odds ratio did not differ significantly from 1. Indirect contact rates also increased with VI, but the effects of both season and pair-type were much smaller than for direct contacts and differed little as the time lag increased from 1-30 days. These results indicate that simple measures of joint space use are insufficient indices of direct contact because group membership can substantially increase contacts at a given level of joint space use. With indirect transmission, however, group membership had a much smaller influence after accounting for VI. Relationships between contact rates and season, VI, and pair-type were generally robust to changes in the proximity criterion defining a contact, and patterns of indirect contacts were affected little by the choice of time lag from 1-30 days. The use of GPS collars provides a framework for testing hypotheses about the form of contact networks among large mammals and comparing potential direct and indirect contact rates across gradients of ecological factors, such as population density or landscape configuration.

TI Synonymous substitution rates predict HIV disease progression as a
   result of underlying replication dynamics
AB Upon HIV transmission, some patients develop AIDS in only a few months, while others remain disease free for 20 or more years. This variation in the rate of disease progression is poorly understood and has been attributed to host genetics, host immune responses, co-infection, viral genetics, and adaptation. Here, we develop a new "relaxed-clock'' phylogenetic method to estimate absolute rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution through time. We identify an unexpected association between the synonymous substitution rate of HIV and disease progression parameters. Since immune activation is the major determinant of HIV disease progression, we propose that this process can also determine viral generation times, by creating favourable conditions for HIV replication. These conclusions may apply more generally to HIV evolution, since we also observed an overall low synonymous substitution rate for HIV-2, which is known to be less pathogenic than HIV-1 and capable of tempering the detrimental effects of immune activation. Humoral immune responses, on the other hand, are the major determinant of nonsynonymous rate changes through time in the envelope gene, and our relaxed-clock estimates support a decrease in selective pressure as a consequence of immune system collapse.

TI Drought-associated Chikungunya emergence along coastal East Africa
AB Epidemics of chikungunya fever, an Aedes spp.-borne viral disease, affected hundreds of thousands of people in western Indian Ocean islands and India during 2005-2006. The initial outbreaks occurred in coastal Kenya (Lamu, then Mombasa) in 2004. We investigated eco-climatic conditions associated with chikungunya fever emergence along coastal Kenya using epidemiologic investigations and satellite data. Unusually dry, warm conditions preceded the outbreaks, including the driest since 1998 for some of the coastal regions. Infrequent replenishment of domestic water stores and elevated temperatures may have facilitated Chikungunya virus transmission. These results suggest that drought-affected populations may be at heightened risk for chikungunya fever, and underscore the need for safe water storage during drought relief operations.

Forty-two species tested positive. From June to September 2003, 86% of corvids, 34% of non-corvid passerines, and 37% of raptors tested positive. We developed the Target Species Index, which identified American crows as the most important avian indicator species. However, testing Multiple species maximizes detection, which may be important early and late in the transmission season. This index may benefit surveillance for other zoonotic pathogens, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. VecTest using oral swabs was most sensitive for American crow, black-billed magpie, house finch, house sparrow, and American kestrel. Wildlife rehabilitation centers should be recruited to enhance WNV surveillance.

TI Effect of infection by Plasmodium falciparum on the melanization immune
   response of Anopheles gambial
AB Melanization is an immune response of mosquitoes that could potentially limit Plasmodium development. That mosquitoes rarely melanize Plasmodium falciparum in natural populations might result from immuno-suppression by the parasite, as has been observed in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected by Plasmodium gallinaceum. We tested this possibility in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes infected by P. falciparum by comparing the ability to melanize a Sephadex bead of infected mosquitoes, of mosquitoes that had fed on infectious blood without becoming infected, and of control mosquitoes fed on uninfected blood. Rather than being immuno-suppressed, infected mosquitoes tended to have a stronger melanization response than mosquitoes in which the infection failed and than control mosquitoes, possibly because of immune activation after previous exposure to invading parasites. This finding suggests that P. falciparum relies on immune evasion rather than immuno-suppression to avoid being melanized and confirms that natural malaria transmission systems differ from laboratory models of mosquito-Plasmodium interactions.

TI Persistence of Brugia malayi DNA in vector and non-vector mosquitoes:
   Implications for xenomonitoring and transmission monitoring of lymphatic
   filariasis
AB Xenomonitoring (detection of filarial larvae or their DNA in mosquitoes) is a sensitive marker for assessing the endemicity of filariasis and a useful tool for evaluating elimination programs. To examine the fate of microfilariae (mf) and filarial DNA in vector competent and non-competent mosquito strains, we compared the detection of Brugia malayi parasites by dissection and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in three different mosquito strains. We conclude that PCR is much more sensitive than dissection for detecting filarial larvae., especially their remnants in mosquitoes. However, parasite DNA can be detected in both vector and non-vector mosquitoes for two weeks or longer after they ingest mf-positive blood. Thus, although xenomonitoring with vector and non-vector mosquito species may be a sensitive method for indirectly detecting filarial parasites in human populations, positive test results for parasite DNA in mosquitoes do not necessarily prove that transmission is ongoing in the study area.

TI Canalization breakdown and evolution in a source-sink system
AB Understanding the process of adaptation to novel environments may help to elucidate several ecological phenomena, from the stability of species range margins to host-pathogen specificity and persistence in degraded habitats. We study evolution in one type of novel environment: a sink habitat where populations cannot persist without recurrent immigration from a source population. Previous studies on source-sink evolution have focused on how extrinsic environmental factors influence adaptation to a sink, but few studies have examined how intrinsic genetic factors influence adaptation. We use an individual-based model to explore how genetic canalization that evolves in gene regulation networks influences the adaptation of a population to a sink. We find that as canalization in the regulation network increases, the probability of adaptation to the novel habitat decreases. When adaptation to the habitat does occur, it is usually preceded by a breakdown of canalization. As evolution continues in the novel habitat, canalization reemerges, but a legacy of the breakdown may remain, even after several generations. We also find that environmental noise tends to increase the probability of adaptation to the novel habitat. Our results suggest that the details of genetic architecture can significantly influence the likelihood of niche evolution in novel environments.

TI West Nile virus and California breeding bird declines
AB Since it was first detected in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) quickly spread, becoming the dominant vector-borne disease in North America. Sometimes fatal to humans, WNV is even more widespread among birds, with hundreds of species known to be susceptible to WNV infection in North America alone. However, despite considerable mortality and local declines observed in American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), there has been little evidence of a large regional association between WNV susceptibility and population declines of any species. Here we demonstrate a correlation between susceptibility to WNV measured by large-scale testing of dead birds and two indices of overall population change among bird species following the spread of WNV throughout California. This result was due primarily to declines in four species of Corvidae, including all species in this family except common ravens (Corvus corax). Our results support the hypothesis that susceptibility to WNV may have negative population consequences to most corvids on regional levels. They also provide confirmation that dead animal surveillance programs can provide important data indicating populations most likely to suffer detrimental impacts due to WNV.

   chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis may not occur on freshwater
   crustaceans in northern Queensland, Australia
AB Chytridiomycosis is a fatal disease of amphibians, caused by the amphibian chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The disease is unusual in that it may drive many amphibian species to local extinction during outbreaks. These dramatic declines in host population numbers could be facilitated if the pathogen can grow as a saprobe or on alternative hosts, a feature common to other chytrid species. This is also supported by in vitro work that demonstrates B. dendrobatidis can grow and reproduce in the absence of amphibian cells. In a previous study, B. dendrobatidis was detected on freshwater shrimp from rain forest streams in northern Queensland, Australia, using diagnostic PCR. We set out to confirm and further investigate the presence of B. dendrobatidis on crustaceans by carrying out more extensive sampling of shrimp in the field, experimental B. dendrobatidis infection trials using shrimp and crayfish, and PCR verification of the presence of B. dendrobatidis from shrimp samples that previously tested positive. We could not confirm the presence of B. dendrobatidis on shrimp, and report that original positive tests in shrimp reported by Rowley et al. (2006) were likely false. Thus, we suggest that shrimp may not be an important reservoir host for B. dendrobatidis.

We looked at how life-history traits of pathogens and their host plants affect the distribution of pathogens in different tropical habitats, and the importance of host phylogeny in determining the habitat associations of obligate fungal pathogens. Our study reveals that plant-pathogen interactions are prevalent and widespread in the tropics. Phylogenetic analysis of the distribution of obligate pathogens among plant families did not suggest a strong overall pattern of higher-level host phylogeny in pathogen host range, except that smut pathogens are particularly dominant on Poaceae and Asteraceae, and rusts are most common on Fabaceae, families that dominate disturbed areas in the tropics.

TI Eating yourself sick: transmission of disease as a function of foraging
   ecology
AB Species interactions may profoundly influence disease outbreaks. However, disease ecology has only begun to integrate interactions between hosts and their food resources (foraging ecology) despite that hosts often encounter their parasites while feeding. A zooplankton-fungal system illustrated this central connection between foraging and transmission. Using experiments that varied food density for Daphnia hosts, density of fungal spores and body size of Daphnia, we produced mechanistic yet general models for disease transmission rate based on broadly applicable components of feeding biology. Best performing models could explain why prevalence of infection declined at high food density and rose sharply as host size increased (a pattern echoed in nature). In comparison, the classic mass-action model for transmission performed quite poorly. These foraging-based models should broadly apply to systems in which hosts encounter parasites while eating, and they will catalyse future integration of the roles of Daphnia as grazer and host.

TI Virus population extinction via ecological traps
AB Populations are at risk of extinction when unsuitable or when sink habitat exceeds a threshold frequency in the environment. Sinks that present cues associated with high-quality habitats, termed ecological traps, have especially detrimental effects on net population growth at metapopulation scales. Ecological traps for viruses arise naturally, or can be engineered, via the expression of viral-binding sites on cells that preclude viral reproduction. We present a model for virus population growth in a heterogeneous host community, parameterized with data from populations of the RNA bacteriophage Phi 6 presented with mixtures of suitable host bacteria and either neutral or trap cells. We demonstrate that viruses can sustain high rates of population growth in the presence of neutral non-hosts as long as some host cells are present, whereas trap cells dramatically reduce viral fitness. In addition, we demonstrate that the efficacy of traps for viral elimination is frequency dependent in spatially structured environments such that population viability is a nonlinear function of habitat loss in dispersal-limited virus populations. We conclude that the ecological concepts applied to species conservation in altered landscapes can also contribute to the development of trap cell therapies for infectious human viruses.

AB We conducted large-scale, systematic sampling of influenza type A virus in migratory waterfowl (mostly mallards [Anas platyrhynchos]) at Ottenby Bird Observatory, southeast Sweden. As with previous studies, we found a higher prevalence in fall than spring, and among juveniles compared with adults. However, in contrast to other studies, we found that prevalence in spring was sometimes high (mean 4.0%, highest 9.5%). This finding raises the possibility that ducks are capable of perpetuating influenza A virus of different subtypes and subtype combinations throughout the year and from 1 year to the next. Isolation of the H5 and H7 subtypes was common, which suggests risk for transmission to sensitive domestic animals such as poultry. We argue that wild bird screening can function as a sentinel system, and we give an example of how it could have been used to forecast a remote and deadly outbreak of influenza A in poultry.

TI Host availability and the evolution of parasite life-history strategies
AB Parasites exploit an inherently patchy resource, their hosts, which are discrete entities that may only be available for infection within a relatively short time window. However, there has been little consideration of how heterogeneities in host availability may affect the phenotypic or genotypic composition of parasite populations or how parasites may evolve to cope with them. Here we conduct a selection experiment involving an entomopathogenic nematode (Steinernema feltiae) and show for the first time that the infection rate of a parasite can evolve rapidly to maximize the chances of infecting within an environment characterized by the rate of host availability. Furthermore, we show that the parasite's infection rate trades off with other fitness traits, such as fecundity and survival. Crucially, the outcome of competition between strains with different infection strategies depends on the rate of host availability; frequently available hosts favor "fast" infecting nematodes, whereas infrequently available hosts favor "slow" infecting nematodes. A simple evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) analysis based on classic epidemiological models fails to capture this behavior, predicting instead that the fastest infecting phenotype should always dominate. However, a novel model incorporating more realistic, discrete bouts of host availability shows that strain coexistence is highly likely. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneities in host availability play a key role in the evolution of parasite life-history traits and in the maintenance of phenotypic variability. Parasite life-history strategies are likely to evolve rapidly in response to changes in host availability induced by disease management programs or by natural dynamics in host abundance. Incorporating parasite evolution in response to host availability would therefore enhance the predictive ability of current epidemiological models of infectious disease.

TI Chemical mediation and niche partitioning in non-pollinating fig-wasp
   communities
AB 1. The parasitic chalcidoid wasps associated with the species-specific and obligatory pollination mutualisms between Ficus spp. and their agaonid wasp pollinators provide a good model to study the functional organization of communities.
   2. However, communities of non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFWs) remain little characterized, and their functioning and evolutionary dynamics are still poorly understood.
   3. We studied the communities of NPFWs associated with the monoecious F. racemosa and the dioecious F. hispida. Associated with these two fig species are a total of seven wasp species belonging to three genera. These species present contrasts in life history traits and in timing of oviposition. The species studied are thus broadly representative of the communities of NPFWs associated specifically with fig-pollinator mutualisms.
   4. In our study systems, there is temporal segregation of oviposition time among members of NPFW communities.
   5. We tested the role of volatile chemicals in the attraction of NPFWs associated with these two fig species, and tried to determine if chemical mediation can explain the organization of the communities.
   6. We conducted odour choice tests using a Y-tube olfactometer. All the NPFWs studied were shown to use volatile chemicals produced by the fig to locate their host. Furthermore, the signals used by each species depended on the phenological stage of the fig they exploit.
   7. Results demonstrated that the pattern of oviposition results from the utilization of volatile signals produced by figs that vary in their composition at different stages of fig development. Thus, chemical mediation allows resource partitioning in the NPFW communities associated with fig-pollinator mutualisms, and suggests hypotheses to explain coexistence in other parasite communities.

TI Do threatened hosts have fewer parasites? A comparative study in
   primates
AB 1. Parasites and infectious diseases have become a major concern in conservation biology, in part because they can trigger or accelerate species or population declines. Focusing on primates as a well-studied host clade, we tested whether the species richness and prevalence of parasites differed between threatened and non-threatened host species.
   2. We collated data on 386 species of parasites (including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths and arthropods) reported to infect wild populations of 36 threatened and 81 non-threatened primate species. Analyses controlled for uneven sampling effort and host phylogeny.
   3. Results showed that total parasite species richness was lower among threatened primates, supporting the prediction that small, isolated host populations harbour fewer parasite species. This trend was consistent across three major parasite groups found in primates (helminths, protozoa and viruses). Counter to our predictions, patterns of parasite species richness were independent of parasite transmission mode and the degree of host specificity.
   4. We also examined the prevalence of selected parasite genera among primate sister-taxa that differed in their ranked threat categories, but found no significant differences in prevalence between threatened and non-threatened hosts.
   5. This study is the first to demonstrate differences in parasite richness relative to host threat status. Results indicate that human activities and host characteristics that increase the extinction risk of wild animal species may lead simultaneously to the loss of parasites. Lower average parasite richness in threatened host taxa also points to the need for a better understanding of the cascading effects of host biodiversity loss for affiliated parasite species.

TI Why are some species more commonly afflicted by arthritis than others? A
   comparative study of spondyloarthropathy in primates and carnivores
AB Spondyloarthropathy is a painful arthritic affliction of humans that also occurs in wild mammals. Important questions remain concerning the underlying causes of spondyloarthropathy in mammals, particularly regarding whether it is infectious in origin or driven by genetic predisposition and environmental stressors. Moreover, spondyloarthropathy has negative effects on host fitness, leading to potential conservation concerns if it impacts threatened species. Using a comparative data set on the prevalence of joint disease in 34 primate species and 100 carnivore species, we tested predictions involving the epidemiological correlates of spondyloarthropathy in wild mammals. Analyses revealed that 5.6% of primates and 3.6% of carnivores exhibited signs of spondyloarthropathy, with maximum incidence as high as 22% in great apes and 27% in bears. We tested whether prevalence of spondyloarthropathy increases with population density and group size, greater contact with soil, a slower host life history, increased ranging, dietary factors and body mass. We found general support for an effect of body mass, with larger bodied primates and carnivores exhibiting a higher prevalence of spondyloarthropathy. In addition, more threatened species experienced higher rates of spondyloarthropathy, with this association influenced by body mass and phylogeny. The effect of body mass could reflect that larger animals are exposed to more pathogens through greater consumption of resources, or that joints of larger bodied mammals experience greater biomechanical stresses, resulting in inflammation and activation of local joint infections.

TI Alternative measures of response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in
   Drosophila melanogaster
AB Studies of invertebrate immune defence often measure genetic variation either for the fitness cost of infection or for the ability of the host to clear the parasite. These studies assume that variation in measures of resistance is related to variation in fitness costs of infection. To test this assumption, we infected strains of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, with a pathogenic bacterium. We then measured the correlation between host bacterial load and the ability to survive infection. Despite the presence of genotypic variation for both traits, bacterial load and survival post-infection were not correlated. Our results support previous arguments that individual measures of immune function and the host's ability to survive infection may be decoupled. In light of these results, we suggest that the difference between tolerance and resistance to infection, a distinction commonly found in the plant literature, may also be of value in studies of invertebrate immunity.

TI Wolbachia-induced unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility and the
   stability of infection polymorphism in parapatric host populations
AB Wolbachia are intracellular, maternally inherited bacteria that are widespread among arthropods and commonly induce a reproductive incompatibility between infected male and uninfected female hosts known as unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). If infected and uninfected populations occur parapatrically, CI acts as a post-zygotic isolation barrier. We investigate the stability of such infection polymorphisms in a mathematical model with two populations linked by migration. We determine critical migration rates below which infected and uninfected populations can coexist. Analytical solutions of the critical migration rate are presented for mainland-island models. These serve as lower estimations for a more general model with two-way migration. The critical migration rate is positive if either Wolbachia causes a fecundity reduction in infected female hosts or its transmission is incomplete, and is highest for intermediate levels of CI. We discuss our results with respect to local adaptations of the Wolbachia host, speciation, and pest control.

TI Manipulation of oviposition choice of the parasitoid wasp, Encarsia
   pergandiella, by the endosymbiotic bacterium Cardinium
AB Reproductive manipulations of hosts by maternally inherited bacterial endosymbionts often result in an increase in the proportion of infected female hosts in the population. When this involves the conversion of incipient males to genetic or functional females, it presents unique difficulties for symbionts invading hosts with sex-specific reproductive behaviours, such as the autoparasitic Encarsia pergandiella. In sexual forms of this species, female eggs are laid in whitefly nymphs and male eggs are laid in conspecific or heterospecific parasitoids developing within the whitefly cuticle. Further, eggs laid in the 'wrong' host do not ordinarily complete development. This study explored the role of a bacterial symbiont, Cardinium, in manipulating oviposition behaviour in a thelytokous population of E. pergandiella. Oviposition choice was measured by the number and location of eggs deposited by both infected and uninfected adult waSPS in arenas containing equal numbers of hosts suitable for the development of male and female waSPS. Uninfected waSPS included antibiotic-treated female waSPS and (untreated) daughters of antibiotic-treated female waSPS. The choices of waSPS in the thelytokous population treatments were compared with those of a conspecific sexual population. We found that offspring of antibiotic-cured thelytokous waSPS reverted to the behaviour of unmated sexual waSPS, laying their few eggs almost exclusively in hosts appropriate for male eggs. Infected thelytokous waSPS distributed their eggs approximately evenly between host types, much like mated sexual female waSPS. The antibiotic-treated female waSPS exhibited choices intermediate to waSPS in the other two treatments. The change in the observed behaviour appears sufficient to allow invasion and persistence of Cardinium in sexual populations. Lastly, our results suggest a reduction in host discrimination as a possible mechanism by which Cardinium influences this change.

TI Long-term intrapatient viral evolution during HIV-2 infection
AB Background. Disease progression and transmission of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) type 2 are attenuated, compared with HIV-1, which is consistent with the lower plasma viral loads observed in HIV-2 infection. Although numerous studies have characterized the intrapatient evolution of viral sequences during HIV-1-infection, prospective studies examining intrapatient evolution during HIV-2 infection have been limited.
   Methods. We examined viral sequence evolution in the C2V3C3 region of the viral env gene in 8 HIV-2-infected individuals from Dakar, Senegal, over the course of similar to 10 years. To compare results with HIV-1 infection, we reanalyzed data from our previous study that prospectively examined intrapatient viral evolution in HIV-1 infected individuals from the same population.
   Results. HIV-2 sequences from early and late time points were phylogenetically intermixed for all subjects. No distinct trends were observed in terms of increases or decreases in fragment size or the number of N-linked glycosylation sites, and ratios of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site to nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site suggested selection to be neutral or negative. In homologous env C2V3 sequences, rates of viral divergence and diversification were slower in individuals infected with HIV-2 than in those infected with HIV-1.
   Conclusions. Viral evolution occurs slowly in HIV-2 infection, which is consistent with the slow disease progression of HIV-2 and supports the notion that viral evolution may be a relevant correlate for disease progression.

TI Parasite phylogeographical congruence with salmon host evolutionarily
   significant units: implications for salmon conservation
AB Comparative phylogeographical studies between parasites and their hosts or with biogeographical regions are useful to predict parasite dispersal potential over a broad geographical range. We used both microsatellite markers and mtDNA sequence data from a trematode parasite, Plagioporus shawi, to test for congruence across two evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) boundaries of its salmonid hosts (Oncorhynchus spp.). We find congruent patterns with the nuclear loci of P. shawi and the ESU boundaries of its salmonid hosts. This pattern indicates that broad-scale phylogeographical patterns of a parasite can be predicted by the biogeographical history of their hosts. Furthermore, this pattern provides independent support for these ESU boundaries as biologically relevant barriers. The mtDNA shows some discordance with nuclear loci and a level of genetic differentiation greater than can be explained by genetic drift. Thus, the mtDNA cannot be used in isolation to infer the population history of P. shawi. The genetic differentiation at both the nuclear and mtDNA markers will be useful for salmon fisheries management by providing a tool to assign ocean-migrating salmonids back to their freshwater population of origin.

TI Cospeciation in the triplex symbiosis of termite gut protists
   (Pseudotrichonympha spp.), their hosts, and their bacterial
   endosymbionts
AB A number of cophylogenetic relationships between two organisms namely a host and a symbiont or parasite have been studied to date; however, organismal interactions in nature usually involve multiple members. Here, we investigated the cospeciation of a triplex symbiotic system comprising a hierarchy of three organisms - termites of the family Rhinotermitidae, cellulolytic protists of the genus Pseudotrichonympha in the guts of these termites, and intracellular bacterial symbionts of the protists. The molecular phylogeny was inferred based on two mitochondrial genes for the termites and nuclear small-subunit rRNA genes for the protists and their endosymbionts, and these were compared. Although intestinal microorganisms are generally considered to have looser associations with the host than intracellular symbionts, the Pseudotrichonympha protists showed almost complete codivergence with the host termites, probably due to strict transmissions by proctodeal trophallaxis or coprophagy based on the social behaviour of the termites. Except for one case, the endosymbiotic bacteria of the protists formed a monophyletic lineage in the order Bacteroidales, and the branching pattern was almost identical to those of the protists and the termites. However, some non-codivergent evolutionary events were evident. The members of this triplex symbiotic system appear to have cospeciated during their evolution with minor exceptions; the evolutionary relationships were probably established by termite sociality and the complex microbial community in the gut.

TI Natural variation in the genetic architecture of a host-parasite
   interaction in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris
AB The genetic architecture of fitness-relevant traits in natural populations is a topic that has remained almost untouched by quantitative genetics. Given the importance of parasitism for the host's fitness, we used QTL mapping to study the genetic architecture of traits relevant for host-parasite interactions in the trypanosome parasite, Crithidia bombi and its host, Bombus terrestris. The three traits analysed were the parasite's infection intensity, the strength of the general immune response (measured as the encapsulation of a novel antigen) and body size. The genetic architecture of these traits was examined in three natural, unmanipulated mapping populations of B. terrestris. Our results indicate that the intracolonial phenotypic variation of all three traits is based on a network of QTLs and epistatic interactions. While these networks are similar between mapping populations in complexity and number of QTLs, as well as in their epistatic interactions, the variability in the position of QTL and the interacting loci was high. Only one QTL for body size was plausibly found in at least two populations. QTLs for encapsulation and Crithidia infection intensity were located on the same linkage groups.

TI Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in lizards from southern Maryland
AB Lizards serve as hosts for Ixodes ticks in the western and southeastern United States and may affect the transmission cycles of Borrelia burgdorferi in these regions. In Maryland, the role of lizards in the maintenance and transmission cycle of this pathogen has not been examined. We tested 29 lizards (Sceloporus undulatus and Eumeces spp.) and 21 ticks from these lizards for the presence of B. burgdorferi. Eight lizards were positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for at least one B. burgdorferi-specific marker. This is the first report of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto detected in lizards in the mid-Atlantic region. Although the viability of the B.,burgdorferi in these lizards was unconfirmed, recovery of bacterial DNA in a tail snip suggests that the infections in these lizards were disseminated. This study suggests that some lizards indigenous to the mid-Atlantic region may serve as alternative reservoirs for B. burgdorferi. In areas where lizard densities are high, these less efficient reservoirs may affect the enzootic cycle of this tick-borne pathogen.

TI Spread of the tiger: Global risk of invasion by the mosquito Aedes
   albopictus
AB Aedes albopictus, commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito, is currently the most invasive mosquito in the world. It is of medical importance due to its aggressive daytime human-biting behavior and ability to vector many viruses, including dengue, LaCrosse, and West Nile. Invasions into new areas of its potential range are often initiated through the transportation of eggs via the international trade in used tires. We use a genetic algorithm, Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production (GARP), to determine the ecological niche of Ae. albopictus and predict a global ecological risk map for the continued spread of the species. We combine this analysis with risk due to importation of tires from infested countries and their proximity to countries that have already been invaded to develop a list of countries most at risk for future introductions and establishments. Methods used here have potential for predicting risks of future invasions of vectors or pathogens.

TI Mortality and reproductive dynamics of Aedes aegypti (Diptera :
   Culicidae) fed human blood
AB Mortality is a critical factor in determining a mosquito's ability to transmit pathogens. We investigated the effect of human blood feeding and reproduction on mortality of the dengue virus vector, Aedes aegypti, by conducting a life-table study of male and female mosquitoes maintained on one of three diets: 10% sucrose, human blood or human blood plus 10% sucrose. We examined the effect of host availability by offering human blood to mosquitoes every day or every other day. Mortality of females was age-dependent and best fit by a logistic or logistic-Makeham model. The availability of blood increased survival; survival of females fed blood plus sugar was greater than those only fed sugar. There was a peak in mortality of females fed blood alone early in life that coincided with the initiation of oviposition. When females in the blood alone group were offered blood daily, their mortality was significantly lower than when they were offered blood every other day. Unlike some previous studies, females fed blood plus sugar had higher fitness than females fed blood alone. Increased fitness may have been due to differences in housing mosquitoes individually in separate cages versus as a group of many mosquitoes in each cage. It was not due to longer survival of males who had access to sugar as a food source. Our results demonstrate that reproductively active Ae. aegypti exhibit age-dependent mortality, which refutes the assumption of age-independent mosquito mortality and underscores the need to incorporate age-dependent factors into pathogen transmission models and research on mosquito biology in general.

TI Inbreeding effects on immune response in free-living song sparrows
   (Melospiza melodia)
AB The consequences of inbreeding for host immunity to parasitic infection have broad implications for the evolutionary and dynamical impacts of parasites on populations where inbreeding occurs. To rigorously assess the magnitude and the prevalence of inbreeding effects on immunity, multiple components of host immune response should be related to inbreeding coefficient (f) in free-living individuals. We used a pedigreed, free-living population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to test whether individual responses to widely used experimental immune challenges varied consistently with f. The patagial swelling response to phytohaemagglutinin declined markedly with f in both females and males in both 2002 and 2003, although overall inbreeding depression was greater in males. The primary antibody response to tetanus toxoid declined with f in females but not in males in both 2004 and 2005. Primary antibody responses to diphtheria toxoid were low but tended to decline with f in 2004. Overall inbreeding depression did not solely reflect particularly strong immune responses in outbred offspring of immigrant-native pairings or weak responses in highly inbred individuals. These data indicate substantial and apparently sex-specific inbreeding effects on immune response, implying that inbred hosts may be relatively susceptible to parasitic infection to differing degrees in males and females.

   homolog) vaccine induces humoral and cellular immunity and improves
   pregnancy outcome in the guinea pig model of congenital cytomegalovirus
   infection
AB Development of a vaccine against congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major public health priority. We report the use of a propagation-defective, single-cycle, RNA replicon vector system, derived from an attenuated strain of the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, to produce virus-like replicon particles (VRPs) expressing GP83, the guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) homolog of the human CMV pp65 phosphoprotein. Vaccination with VRP-GP83 induced antibodies and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses in GPCMV-seronegative female guinea pigs. Guinea pigs immunized with VRP-GP83 vaccine or with a VRP vaccine expressing influenza hemagglutinin (VRP-HA) were bred for pregnancy and subsequent GPCMV challenge during the early third trimester. Dams vaccinated with VRP-GP83 had improved pregnancy outcomes, compared with dams vaccinated with the VRP-HA control. For VRP-GP83-vaccinated dams, there were 28 live pups and 4 dead pups (13% mortality) among 10 evaluable litters, compared with 9 live pups and 12 dead pups (57% mortality) among 8 evaluable litters in the VRP-HA-vaccinated group (P < .001, Fisher's exact test). Improved pregnancy outcome was accompanied by reductions in maternal blood viral load, measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. These results indicate that cell-mediated immune responses directed against a CMV matrix protein can protect against congenital CMV infection and disease.

TI Influence of HLA alleles on shedding of Kaposi sarcoma-associated
   herpesvirus in saliva in an African population
AB Background. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Infection in childhood involves mother-to-child transmission and transmission between siblings or other close contacts. Large amounts of viral DNA in saliva have been linked to transmission from mother to child. To investigate factors contributing to the shedding of KSHV in the saliva of mothers in rural South Africa, we sequenced the HLA-A alleles of 448 mothers and the HLA-DRB1 alleles of 363 mothers and compared their HLA types with viral loads in saliva.
   Methods. Viral load was quantified with real-time polymerase chain reaction on DNA extracted from saliva. HLA-A and HLA-DRB1 allele groups were determined by sequencing-based typing.
   Results. We found that 2 HLA-A alleles, A*6801 and A*4301, and 1 HLA-DRB1 allele group, DRB1*04, were associated with shedding of KSHV in saliva. KSHV could be detected more frequently in mothers carrying at least 1 copy of HLA-A*6801 or HLA-A*4301, and higher viral loads were found in HLA-A*68- and HLA-DRB1*04 carrying mothers.
   Conclusions. These findings could suggest that 2 HLA-A alleles, A*6801 and A*4301, and 1 HLA-DRB1 allele group, DRB1*04, that are more frequent in African populations might be associated with an impaired control of KSHV and, hence, increased shedding in saliva.

   experimental herpes simplex virus encephalitis in mice
AB Background. Glucocorticoids (GCs) have not been established as an evidence-based therapy for herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. We sought to evaluate the effects of early versus delayed GC administration in a model of HSV-1 encephalitis.
   Methods. Mice were inoculated intranasally with a clinical HSV-1 strain and had access to corticosterone (Cort; 0.2 mg/mL) in drinking water or received dexamethasone (DEX; 10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Cort was started immediately or 72 h after infection, whereas DEX was administrated 3 days after infection.
   Results. Expression of the thymidine kinase transcript indicated widespread viral replication in the brain stem and many regions of the mediovestibular system. This neurovirulence provoked neuronal death and transcriptional activation of several immune genes. Notably, Toll-like receptors 2, 3, and 9 transcripts were strongly up-regulated. Mean life expectancy was higher in the group of mice that received delayed Cort (56%) than in the mice that received no Cort (44%) or early Cort treatments (13%) (P < .05, early vs. delayed or no Cort treatments). Delayed DEX treatment suppressed not only the expression of inflammatory genes as expected but also that of viral genes.
   Conclusions. Administration of GCs at a critical time during viral infection is associated with neuroprotection and survival in experimental HSV-1 encephalitis.

TI Stability of genetic polymorphism in host-parasite interactions
AB Allelic diversity is common at host loci involved in parasite recognition, such as the major histocompatibility complex in vertebrates or gene-for-gene relationships in plants, and in corresponding loci encoding antigenic molecules in parasites. Diverse factors have been proposed in models to account for genetic polymorphism in host-parasite recognition. Here, a simple but general theory of host-parasite coevolution is developed. Coevolution implies the existence of indirect frequency-dependent selection (FDS), because natural selection on the host depends on the frequency of a parasite gene, and vice versa. It is shown that polymorphism can be maintained in both organisms only if there is negative, direct FDS, such that the strength of natural selection for the host resistance allele, the parasite virulence allele or both declines with increasing frequency of that allele itself. This condition may be fulfilled if the parasite has more than one generation in the same host individual, a feature which is common to most diseases. It is argued that the general theory encompasses almost all factors previously proposed to account for polymorphism at corresponding host and parasite loci, including those controlling gene-for-gene interactions.

TI An evolutionarily stable strategy model for the evolution of dimorphic
   development in the butterfly Maculinea rebeli, a social parasite of
   Myrmica ant colonies
AB Caterpillars of the butterfly Maculinea rebeli develop as parasites inside ant colonies. In intensively studied French populations, about 25% of caterpillars mature within 1 year (fast-developing larvae [FDL]) and the others after 2 years (slow-developing larvae [SDL]); all available evidence indicates that this ratio is under the control of egg-laying females. We present an analytical model to predict the evolutionarily stable fraction of FDL (P-ess). The model accounts for added winter mortality of SDL, general and kin competition among caterpillars, a competitive advantage of SDL over newly entering FDL (priority effect), and the avoidance of renewed infection of ant nests by butterflies in the coming season (segregation). We come to the following conclusions: (1) all factors listed above can promote the evolution of delayed development; (2) kin competition and segregation stabilize P-ess near 0.5; and (3) a priority effect is the only mechanism potentially selecting for P-ess < 0.5. However, given the empirical data, p ESS is predicted to fall closer to 0.5 than to the 0.25 that has been observed. In this particular system, bet hedging cannot explain why more than 50% of larvae postpone growth. Presumably, other fitness benefits for SDL, for example, higher fertility or longevity, also contribute to the evolution of delayed development. The model presented here may be of general applicability for systems where maturing individuals compete in small subgroups.

AB It is estimated that of 50000 persons in Scotland (1% of the County's Population), infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), around 90% injected drugs. This paper reviews data on the prevalence and incidence of HCV, and the methods used to generate such information, among injecting drug users (IDUs), in Scotland. The prevalence estimate for HCV among IDUs in Scotland as a whole (44% in 2000), is comparable with those observed in many European countries. Incidence rates ranged from 11.9 to 28.4/100 person-years. The data have shaped policy to prevent infection among IDUs and have informed predictions of the number of HCV-infected IDUs who will likely progress to, and require treatment and care for, severe HCV-related liver disease. Although harm reduction interventions, in particular needle and syringe exchanges and methadone maintenance therapy, reduced the transmission of HCV among IDUs during the early to mid-1990s, incidence in many parts of the Country remains high. The prevention of HCV among IDUs continues to be one of Scotland's major public health challenges.

TI Parasite-driven genetic change in a natural population of Daphnia
AB A substantial body of theory indicates that parasites may mould the population genetic structure of their hosts, but few empirical studies have directly linked parasitism to genetic dynamics. We used molecular markers (allozymes) to investigate genotype frequency changes in a natural population of the crustacean Daphnia magna in relation to an epidemic of the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa. The population experienced a severe epidemic during the study period in which parasite prevalence reached 100% of the adult portion of the population. The parasite epidemic was associated with genetic change in the host population. Clonal diversity was observed to decrease as parasite prevalence increased in the population, and tests for differences in the clonal composition of the population before, during, and after the epidemic indicated that significant change had occurred. A laboratory infection experiment showed that the genotypes which were more common following the peak of the parasite epidemic were also the most resistant to parasite infection. Thus, this study provides an illustration of parasite-mediated selection in the wild.

TI The genetic architecture of immune defense and reproduction in male
   Bombus terrestris bumblebees
AB Understanding the architecture of genetic variation, that is the number, effect, location, and interaction, of genes responsible for phenotypic variability in nature is important for the understanding of microevolutionary processes. In this study, we have used a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach to uncover the genetic architecture of fitness-relevant traits associated with reproduction and immune defense in male Bombus terrestris bumblebees. Three male reproductive investment traits, the number and length of the produced sperm and the size of the accessory glands, were studied. Two branches of the insect innate immune system, the activation of the Phenoloxidase-cascade and the hemolymph's antibacterial activity, were investigated. We found that variation in most of the studied traits is based on a network of minor QTLs and epistatic interactions. Unexpectedly, there was no evidence for phenotypic or genetic trade-offs between the presumably costly investment in immune defense and reproductive effort in this population for the measured traits. In fact, we found a positive correlation, both, in phenotype and genetic architecture for the number of produced sperm and antibacterial. activity against an insect pathogen. A major finding for all traits analyzed was that the epistatic interactions accounted for a major proportion of the explained phenotypic variance. Especially for traits involved in immune defense, this pattern highlights the possible role of parasites in the evolution and maintenance of recombination and sexual reproduction.

TI Fitness consequences of variation in natural antibodies and complement
   in the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica
AB 1. The immune system and its component parts have evolved and are maintained due to the fitness benefits that hosts acquire in terms of parasite resistance. However, there are relatively few studies of the fitness consequences of natural variation in immunity in free-living populations, mainly due to the complexity of the immune system and logistic problems of assessing immunity and fitness components.
   2. We quantified two aspects of humoral immunity in a population of Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica, natural antibodies and complement that constitute the first line of defence against parasites.
   3. The magnitude of both immune components increased during the breeding season.
   4. Very old adults had reduced levels of natural antibodies, providing evidence consistent with immuno-senescence, while that was not the case for lysis. However, there was no evidence that survivors from one year to the next had stronger agglutination or lysis than nonsurvivors.
   5. Females with a second clutch had higher levels of natural antibodies than females that only had a single clutch, while males showed no differences. Annual fecundity of females decreased with natural antibody levels, that was not evident in males. Therefore, in females, natural antibody and complement levels are important predictors of vital rates.
   6. Tail length of male partners, but not of females, explained the variation in female natural antibodies and complement, while there was no similar effect in males. This pattern may have arisen from differential parental investment by females mated to the most attractive males.
   7. The abundance of four different ectoparasites was not predicted by either immune component.

TI Population responses to sterility imposed on female European rabbits
AB Additional methods are needed in Australia to control the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, which continues to destroy valued native flora. A control option under development, immunocontraception, is intended to suppress the rabbit's high fertility. It would spread contagiously via genetically modified myxoma virus and European rabbit fleas Spilopsyllus cuniculi. An experiment with field populations of rabbits assessed whether suppressing fertility reduces their abundance.
   In south-eastern Australia, four treatments in three replicates were applied to 12 subpopulations of rabbits. The treatments were surgical sterilization of 0%, 40%, 60% and 80% of the adult and juvenile females trapped before the annual breeding seasons of 1993-96.
   The sterilized populations produced fewer young but the average adult population size remained unchanged in all treatments. Immigration was minimal in all treatments.
   Sterilized adult female rabbits survived much better than fertile females, indicating a high cost of reproduction. Immature rabbits and unsterilized adults of both sexes also survived better in the sterilization treatments. The improved survival in all rabbit classes compensated for reduced reproductive output.
   Fleas were fewer on both adult females and males in the sterilized populations but this did not impede transmission of myxomatosis.
   Synthesis and applications. Imposing sterility on rabbit populations reduces breeding-season peaks of abundance. Improved survival compensates for the sterility of up to 80% of females and sustains populations, even in the presence of drought and myxomatosis. Immunocontraception alone has poor prospects for controlling rabbits. Cost-effective rabbit control requires multiple, integrated forms of attrition.

TI High rates of forward transmission events after acute/early HIV-1
   infection
AB Background. A population-based phylogenetic approach was used to characterize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-transmission dynamics in Quebec.
   Methods. HIV-1 pol sequences included primary HIV infections (PHIs; < 6 months after seroconversion) from the Quebec PHI cohort (1998-2005; n = 215) and the provincial genotyping program (2001-2005; n = 481). Phylogenetic analysis determined sequence interrelationships among unique PHIs (n = 593) and infections from untreated (n = 135) and treated (n = 660) chronically infected (CI) potential transmitter populations (2001-2005). Clinical features, risk factors, and drug resistance for clustered and nonclustered transmission events were ascertained.
   Results. Viruses from 49.4% (293/593) of PHIs cosegregated into 75 transmission chains with 2-17 transmissions/cluster. Half of the clusters included 2.7 +/- 0.8 (mean +/- SD) transmissions, whereas the remainder had 8.8 +/- 3.5 transmissions. Maximum periods for onward transmission in clusters were 15.2 +/- 9.5 Coclustering of untreated and treated CIs with PHIs were infrequent (6.2% and 4.8%, respectively). The ages, viremia, and risk factors were similar for clustered and nonclustered transmission events. Low prevalence of drug resistance in PHI supported amplified transmissions at early stages.
   Conclusions. Early infection accounts for approximately half of onward transmissions in this urban North American study. Therapy at early stages of disease may prevent onward HIV transmission.

TI Sexual and other noninjection risks for HBV and HCV seroconversions
   among noninjecting heroin users
AB Background. Many heroin users do not inject drugs but may still be at risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), via sexual or other noninjection-related activity.
   Methods. Noninjecting heroin users (NIUs) in New York City who were recruited and prospectively followed during March 1996-February 2003 were tested for anti-HIV, anti-hepatitis B core antigen, and anti-HCV and were interviewed about their sexual and other noninjecting risk. A seroconversion is represented by the first positive test result after the last negative test result. Hazard ratios (HRs) (P < .05) were estimated by use of Cox proportional hazards regression.
   Results. Of 253 HIV-negative participants, 2 seroconverted (0.29/100 person-years at risk [pyar]); of 184 HBV-negative participants, 16 (3.3/100 pyar); and, of 219 HCV-negative participants, 16 (2.7/100 pyar). Independent predictors of seroconversion were, for HBV, being a female who engages in unprotected receptive anal sex (HR, 6.8), having short-term sex partners (HR, 6.2), and being a male with male sex partners (HR, 5.7); for HCV, being a male who receives money/drugs for sex (HR, 5.6) and sharing noninjecting crack-use equipment (HR, 4.5).
   Conclusions. NIUs are at considerable risk of HBV infection via high-risk sex; and, for HCV, via high-risk sexual activity and the sharing of noninjecting crack-use equipment. Interventions in NIUs must seek to reduce high-risk sexual activity and the sharing of noninjecting drug-use equipment.

TI Human T-lymphotropic virus 1: recent knowledge about an ancient
   infection
AB Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) has infected human beings for thousands of years, but knowledge about the infection and its pathogenesis is only recently emerging. The virus can be transmitted from mother to child, through sexual contact, and through contaminated blood products. There are areas in Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and South America where more than 1% of the general population is infected. Although the majority of HTLV-1 carriers remain asymptomatic, the virus is associated with severe diseases that can be subdivided into three categories: neoplastic diseases (adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma), inflammatory syndromes (HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and uveitis among others), and opportunistic infections (including Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection and others). The understanding of the interaction between virus and host response has improved markedly, but there are still no clear surrogate markers for prognosis and there are few treatment options.

TI Killed but metabolically active Salmonella typhimurium: Application of a
   new technology to an old vector
AB Previous studies have shown that attenuated salmonellae utilized as vaccine vectors engender strong immune responses; however, balancing immunogenicity with reactogenicity remains problematic. Recent work in other bacteria has shown that photochemical treatment of DNA excision repair mutants (DuvrAB) renders organisms "killed but metabolically active" (KBMA). Here, we extend this concept to Salmonella typhimurium. A strain of attenuated S. typhimurium previously evaluated in human volunteers was further deleted for uvrAB genes and designated CKS362. Photochemical treatment of CKS362 resulted in significant inactivation. These KBMA organisms were metabolically active as shown by radioactive methionine incorporation and lactate dehydrogenase activity. In mice inoculated intraperitoneally, KBMA CKS362 was markedly less reactogenic and stimulated a humoral immune equivalent to its live counterpart. Because the parental strain has previously been found to elicit strong immune responses to Salmonella antigens, we propose CKS362 as a prototype strain to test the immunogenicity of KBMA organisms in humans.

TI Spectrum of rift valley fever virus transmission in Kenya: Insights from
   three distinct regions
AB Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging pathogen that maintains high biodefense priority based on its threat to livestock, its ability to cause human hemorrhagic fever, and its potential for aerosol spread. To define the range of human transmission during inter-epidemic and epidemic periods in Kenya, we tested archived sera from defined populations (N = 1,263) for anti-RVFV IgG by ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization testing. RVFV seroprevalence was 10.8% overall and varied significantly by location, sex, and age. In NW Kenya, high seroprevalence among those born before 1980 indicates that an undetected epidemic may have occurred then. Seroconversion documented in highland areas suggests previously unsuspected inter-epidemic transmission. RVFV seroprevalence is strikingly high in certain Kenyan areas, suggesting endemic transmission patterns that may preclude accurate estimation of regional acute outbreak incidence. The extent of both epidemic and inter-epidemic RVFV transmission in Kenya is greater than previously documented.

AB We used geographic information systems and a spatial analysis approach to explore the pattern of Ross River virus (RRV) incidence in Brisbane, Australia. Climate, vegetation and socioeconomic data in 2001 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Brisbane City Council and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. Information on the RRV cases was obtained from the Queensland Department of Health. Spatial and multiple negative binomial regression models were used to identify the socioeconomic and environmental determinants of RRV transmission. The results show that RRV activity was primarily concentrated in the northeastern, northwestern, and southeastern regions in Brisbane. Multiple negative binomial regression models showed that the spatial pattern of RRV disease in Brisbane seemed to be determined by a combination of local ecologic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors.

AB Transmission experiments are essential to assess vector competence. In an attempt to study Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) transmission in its arthropod vector, disseminated infection rates were measured in Culex pipiens quinquefasciatits exposed to Clone 13, an avirulent variant of RVFV. We compared the classic system of glass feeders covered with different membranes (0-1%) with an alternative system in which a cotton stick is used as a support of a blood meal. The latter system showed the highest successful feeding rate (80%). Using this system, we optimized two parameters to obtain the highest numbers of engorged females and thus the highest numbers of females with disseminated infection: 1) use of freshly collected washed erythrocytes and 2) duration of the extrinsic incubation period of at least 14 days after infection.

TI Intraspecific competition: The role of lags between attack and death in
   host-parasitoid interactions
AB Many natural enemies do not immediately kill their host, and the lag this creates between attack and host death results in mixed populations of uninfected and infected hosts. Both competition and parasitism are known to be major structuring forces in ecological communities; however, surprisingly little is known about how the competitive nature of infected hosts could affect the survival and dynamics of remaining uninfected host populations. Using a laboratory system comprising the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, and a solitary koinobiont parasitoid, Venturia canescens, we address this question by conducting replicated competition experiments between the unparasitized and parasitized classes of host larvae. For varying proportions of parasitized host larvae and competitor densities, we consider the effects of competition within (intraclass) and between (interclass) unparasitized and parasitized larvae on the survival, development time, and size of adult moths and parasitoid wasps. The greatest effects were on survival: increased competitor densities reduced survival of both parasitized and unparasitized larvae. However, unparasitized larvae survival, but not parasitized larvae survival, was reduced by increasing interclass competition. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of the competitive superiority of parasitized over unparasitized hosts for limiting resources. We discuss possible mechanisms for this phenomenon, why it may have evolved, and its possible influence on the stability of host-parasite dynamics.

TI A synthesis of experimental work on parasite local adaptation
AB The study of parasite local adaptation, whereby parasites perform better on sympatric hosts than on allopatric hosts and/or better on their own host population than do other parasites, is of great importance to both basic and applied biology. Theoretical examination of host-parasite coevolution predicts that parasite migration rate, generation time and virulence all contribute to the pattern of parasite local adaptation, such that parasites with greater dispersal ability, more frequent reproduction and/or high virulence ought to exhibit increased infectivity on local hosts. Here, we present a meta-analysis of experimental work from 57 host-parasite systems across 54 local adaptation studies to directly test theoretical predictions concerning the effect of each attribute on parasite adaptation. As expected, we find that studies of parasites with higher migration rates than their hosts report local adaptation, as measured by infection success, significantly more often than studies of parasites with relatively low migration rates. Furthermore, this synthesis serves to identify biases in the current body of work and highlight areas with the greatest need for further study. We emphasize the importance of unifying the field with regard to experimental methods, local adaptation definitions and reported statistics for cross-infection studies.

   host-pathogen system
AB This review examines the current situation of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in southern African savannah systems, and uses theory on multi-species host-pathogen systems to suggest possible options for future research and management. In Southern Africa, the buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the Kafue lechwe [Marsh antelope] (Kobus leche) have been found to be maintenance hosts for this disease, but the importance of other host species is becoming apparent. The role of other host species in the maintenance and spread of the disease varies, depending on the spatial distribution and resource utilization patterns of the species, disease susceptibility, transmission modes and the ecology of both host(s) and vector(s). Future research needs to identify the pathogenicity of bTB in each of the host species, and the mechanisms and rates of inter- and intra-specific transmission among different species, in order to develop multi-host models to understand the development and spread of the disease.

   programmes: gender differences and other related factors
AB The aims were to assess the prevalence of HIV infection among young adult heroin users, including injecting heroin users (IHUs) and non-injecting heroin users (NIHUs), and to explore the differences by gender and other factors. The design was a cross-sectional cohort study between April 2001 and December 2003, which included 961 current heroin users (HU), aged 18-30 years: 422 in Madrid, 351 in Barcelona and 188 in Seville; 621 were IHUs and 340 were NIHUs. All were street-recruited by chain referral methods. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire with computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). Samples for HIV testing (dried blood spot) were collected and tested with ELISA and Western Blot. Bivariate, logistic regression, and classification and regression tree analyses were performed. The overall prevalence of HIV infection among IHUs was 25 center dot 8,% (95 % CI 22 center dot 3-29 center dot 3) [32 center dot 4 % (95 % CI 26 center dot 6-38 center dot 1) in Madrid, 20 center dot 5 % (95 % CI 15 center dot 6-25 center dot 4) in Barcelona, and 20 center dot 6 % (95 % CI 9 center dot 8-31-4) in Seville], whereas in NIHUs it was 4 center dot 0% (95 % CI 2 center dot 1-6 center dot 7), with no differences among cities. The prevalence was significantly higher in women than in men in NIHUs (10 center dot 9%, 95 % CI 4 center dot 3-17 center dot 5 vs. 1 center dot 7%, 95 % CI 0 center dot 5-4 center dot 2) and was non-significantly higher in IHUs (30 center dot 4%, 95 % CI 23 center dot 0-37-8 vs. 24 center dot 1 %, 95 % CI 20 center dot 1-28 center dot 1). HIV prevalence in short-term IHUs was 12 center dot 9 % (CI 8 center dot 8-17 center dot 02), with no differences among cities. In the logistic analysis, the variables associated with infection in IHUs were ever having injected with used syringes (OR 3 center dot 4, 95 % CI 2 center dot 2-5 center dot 3), ever having been in prison (OR 2 center dot 6, 95 % CI 1 center dot 6-4 center dot 0), and heroin as the first drug injected at least weekly (OR 2 center dot 3, 95 % CI 1 center dot 1-4 center dot 5). Factors positively associated with HIV infection in NIHUs were female sex (OR 8 center dot 7, 95 % CI 2 center dot 6-29 center dot 2) and age >25 years (OR 3 center dot 1, 95 % CI 0 center dot 9-11 center dot 1), while primary educational level was inversely associated (OR 0 center dot 26, 95 % CI 0 center dot 1-0 center dot 9). Although there are important geographic differences, HIV prevalence in 1HUs remains high, even in short-term IHUs, whereas it was almost six times lower in NIHUs. The prevalence in women is higher than in men, particularly among NIHUs. A wide range of preventive strategies should be developed, aimed primarily at empowering women to negotiate safe sex.

TI The impact of migration from parasite-free patches on antagonistic
   host-parasite coevolution
AB Natural populations of hosts and parasites are often subdivided and patchily distributed such that some regions of a host species' range will be free from a given parasite. Host migration from parasite-free to parasite-containing patches is expected to alter coevolutionary dynamics by changing the evolutionary potential of antagonists. Specifically, host immigration can favor parasites by increasing transmission opportunities, or hosts by introducing genetic variation. We tested these predictions in coevolving populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens and phage Phi 2 that received immigrants from phage-free populations. We observed a negative quadratic relationship between sympatric resistance to phage and host immigration rate (highest at intermediate immigration) but a positive quadratic relationship between coevolution rate and host immigration rate (lowest at intermediate immigration). These results indicate that for a wide range of rates, host immigration from parasite-free patches can increase the evolutionary potential of parasites, and increase the coevolutionary rate if parasite adaptation is limiting in the absence of immigration.

TI Inference of parasite local adaptation using two different fitness
   components
AB Estimating parasite fitness is central to studies aiming to understand parasite evolution. Theoretical models generally use the basic reproductive rate R-0 to express fitness, yet it is very difficult to quantify R-0 empirically and experimental studies often use fitness components such as infection intensity or infectivity as substitutes. These surrogate measures may be biased in several ways. We assessed local adaptation of the microsporidium Ordospora colligata to its host, the crustacean Daphnia magna using two different parasite fitness components: infection persistence over several host generations in experimental populations and infection intensity in individual hosts. We argue that infection persistence is a close estimator of R-0, whereas infection intensity measures only a component of it. Both measures show a pattern that is consistent with parasite local adaptation and they correlate positively. However, several inconsistencies between them suggest that infection intensity may at times provide an inadequate estimate of parasite fitness.

TI A screen for immunity genes evolving under positive selection in
   Drosophila
AB Genes involved in the immune system tend to have higher rates of adaptive evolution than other genes in the genome, probably because they are coevolving with pathogens. We have screened a sample of Drosophila genes to identify those evolving under positive selection. First, we identified rapidly evolving immunity genes by comparing 140 loci in Drosophila erecta and D. yakuba. Secondly, we resequenced 23 of the fastest evolving genes from the independent species pair D. melanogaster and D. simulans, and identified those under positive selection using a McDonald-Kreitman test. There was strong evidence of adaptive evolution in two serine proteases (persephone and spirit) and a homolog of the Anopheles serpin SRPN6, and weaker evidence in another serine protease and the death domain protein dFADD. These results add to mounting evidence that immune signalling pathway molecules often evolve rapidly, possibly because they are sites of host-parasite coevolution.

TI Geographic structure in a widespread plant-mycorrhizal interaction:
   pines and false truffles
AB Mutualistic interactions are likely to exhibit a strong geographic mosaic in their coevolutionary dynamics, but the structure of geographic variation in these interactions is much more poorly characterized than in host-parasite interactions. We used a cross-inoculation experiment to characterize the scales and patterns at which geographic structure has evolved in an interaction between three pine species and one ectomycorrhizal fungus species along the west coast of North America. We found substantial and contrasting patterns of geographic interaction structure for the plants and fungi. The fungi exhibited a clinal pattern of local adaptation to their host plants across the geographic range of three coastal pines. In contrast, plant growth parameters were unaffected by fungal variation, but varied among plant populations and species. Both plant and fungal performance measures varied strongly with latitude. This set of results indicates that in such widespread species interactions, interacting species may evolve asymmetrically in a geographic mosaic because of differing evolutionary responses to clinally varying biotic and abiotic factors.

TI Life cycle abbreviation in the trematode Coitocaecum parvum: can
   parasites adjust to variable conditions?
AB The complex life cycles of parasites are thought to have evolved from simple one-host cycles by incorporating new hosts. Nevertheless, complex developmental routes present parasites with a sequence of highly unlikely transmission events in order to complete their life cycles. Some trematodes like Coitocaecum parvum use facultative life cycle abbreviation to counter the odds of trophic transmission to the definitive host. Parasites adopting life cycle truncation possess the ability to reproduce within their intermediate host, using progenesis, without the need to reach the definitive host. Usually, both abbreviated and normal life cycles are observed in the same population of parasites. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that C. parvum can modulate its development in its amphipod intermediate host and adopt either the abbreviated or the normal life cycle depending on current transmission opportunities or the degree of intra-host competition among individual parasites. In the presence of cues from its predatory definitive host, the parasite is significantly less likely to adopt progenesis than in the absence of such cues. An intermediate response is obtained when the parasites are exposed to cues from non-host predators. The adoption of progenesis is less likely, however, when two parasites share the resource-limited intermediate host. These results show that parasites with complex developmental routes have transmission strategies and perception abilities that are more sophisticated than previously thought.

TI Short- and long-term benefits and detriments to recombination under
   antagonistic coevolution
AB We explored the evolution of recombination under antagonistic coevolution, concentrating on the equilibrium frequencies of modifier alleles causing recombination in initially nonrecombining populations. We found that the equilibrium level of recombination in the host depended not only on parasite virulence, but also on the strength of the modifier allele, and on whether or not the modifier was physically linked to the parasite interaction loci. Nonetheless, the maximum level of recombination for linked loci at equilibrium was about 0.3 (60% of free recombination) for interactions with highly virulent parasites; the level decreased for unlinked modifiers, and for lower levels of parasite virulence. We conclude that recombination spreads because it provides a combination of an immediate (next-generation) fitness benefit and a delayed (two or more generations) increase in the rate of response to directional selection. The relative impact of these two mechanisms depends on the virulence of parasites early in the spread of the modifier, but a trade-off between the two dictates the equilibrium modifier frequency for all nonzero virulences that we examined. In addition, population mean fitness was higher in populations at intermediate equilibria than populations fixed for free recombination or no recombination. The difference, however, was not enough on its own to overcome the two-fold cost of producing males.

   Methods. At baseline and every 3 months thereafter, participants were interviewed, and blood and genital samples were collected. Predictors of HIV-1 incidence were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.
   Results. Of 845 women who were HIV-1 seronegative at baseline, 689 ( 81.5%) were monitored in the study for a total of 698.6 person-years at risk ( PYARs). The overall HIV-1 incidence was 4.6/100 PYARs ( 95% confidence interval [ CI], 3.0-6.2/100 PYARs), and condom use was very low. After adjustment for other risk factors, the risk of HIV-1 was increased among women with HSV-2 at baseline ( hazard ratio [ HR], 4.3 [ 95% CI, 1.5-12.4]) and in those who acquired HSV-2 during the study period ( HR, 5.5 [ 95% CI, 1.2-25.4]). Other independent predictors of HIV-1 were baseline chlamydial infection ( HR, 5.2), bacterial vaginosis ( HR, 2.1), and the occurrence of genital ulcers ( HR, 2.7).
   Conclusion. HSV-2 and other genital infections were the most important risk factors for HIV-1. Control of these infections could help to reduce HIV-1 incidence in this population.

TI Chikungunya, an epidemic arbovirosis
AB Chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted by aedes mosquitoes. The virus was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania. Chikungunya virus is a member of the genus Alphavirus and the family Togaviridae. The disease typically consists of an acute illness characterised by fever, rash, and incapacitating arthralgia. The word chikungunya, used for both the virus and the disease, means "to walk bent over" in some east African languages, and refers to the effect of the joint pains that characterise this dengue-like infection. Chikungunya is a specifically tropical disease, but it is geographically restricted and outbreaks are relatively uncommon. It is only occasionally observed in travellers and military personnel. More than 266 000 people have been infected during the ongoing outbreak in Reunion, in which Aedes albopictus is the presumed vector. In the ongoing Indian outbreak, in which Aedes aegypti is the presumed vector, 1400000 cases of chikungunya were reported during 2006. The reasons for the re-emergence of chikungunya on the Indian subcontinent, and for its unprecedented incidence rate in the Indian Ocean region, are unclear. Plausible explanations include increased tourism, chikungunya virus introduction into a naive population, and viral mutation.

TI Population structure and the co-evolution between social parasites and
   their hosts
AB Co-evolutionary trajectories of host-parasite interactions are strongly affected by the antagonists' evolutionary potential, which in turn depends on population sizes as well as levels of recombination, mutation, and gene flow. Under similar selection pressures, the opponent with the higher evolutionary rate is expected to lead the co-evolutionary arms race and to develop local adaptations. Here, we use mitochondrial DNA sequence data and microsatellite markers to assess the amount of genetic variability and levels of gene flow in two host-parasite systems, each consisting of an ant social parasite - the European slavemaker Harpagoxenus sublaevis and the North American slavemaker Protomognathus americanus - and its two main host species. Our population genetic analyses revealed limited gene flow between individual populations of both host and parasite species, allowing for a geographic mosaic of co-evolution. In a between-system comparison, we found less genetic variability and more pronounced structure in Europe, where previous behavioural studies demonstrated strong local adaptation. Within the European host-parasite system, the larger host species Leptothorax acervorum exhibited higher levels of both genetic variability and gene flow, and previous field data showed that it is less affected by the social parasite H. sublaevis than the smaller host Leptothorax muscorum, which has genetically depleted and isolated populations. In North America, the parasite P. americanus showed higher levels of gene flow between sites, but overall less genetic diversity than its hyper-variable main host species, Temnothorax longispinosus. Interestingly, recent ecological and chemical studies demonstrated adaptation of P. americanus to local host populations, indicating the importance of migration in co-evolutionary interactions.

TI Seasonality and the persistence and invasion of measles
AB The critical community size (CCS) for measles, which separates persistent from extinction-prone populations, is arguably the best understood stochastic threshold in ecology. Using simple models, we explore a relatively neglected relationship of how the CCS scales with birth rate. A predominantly positive relationship of persistence with birth rate is complicated by the accompanying dynamical transitions of the underlying deterministic process. We show that these transitions imply a lower CCS for high birth rate less developed countries and contrary to the experience in lower birth rate, industrial countries, the CCS may increase after vaccination. We also consider the evolutionary implications of the CCS for the origin of measles; this analysis explores how the deterministic and stochastic thresholds for invasion and persistence set limits on the mechanism by which this highly infectious pathogen could have successfully colonized its human host.

TI Disease transmission by cannibalism: rare event or common occurrence?
AB Cannibalism has been documented as a possible disease transmission route in several species, including humans. However, the dynamics resulting from this type of disease transmission are not well understood. Using a theoretical model, we explore how cannibalism (i.e. killing and consumption of dead conspecifics) and intraspecific necrophagy (i.e. consumption of dead conspecifics) affect host-pathogen dynamics. We show that group cannibalism, i.e. shared consumption of victims, is a necessary condition for disease spread by cannibalism in the absence of alternative transmission modes. Thus, endemic diseases transmitted predominantly by cannibalism are likely to be rare, except in social organisms that share conspecific prey. These results are consistent with a review of the literature showing that diseases transmitted by cannibalism are infrequent in animals, even though both cannibalism and trophic transmission are very common.

AB Reliable estimates of population size are important for developing and monitoring health programs in at-risk populations. Laska, Meisner, and Siegel (Biometrics 1988;44:461-72) developed an unbiased estimator for the size of a population at a single venue based on a single sample. Because many populations of interest are not contained within a single venue, this article generalizes the Laska, Meisner, and Siegel estimator to incorporate two- and three-stage sampling designs and enable estimation of total population size over multiple venues. Use of the estimator with two- and three-stage sampling designs is illustrated with examples that estimate the size of a population of individuals who socialize over a 4-week period at public venues where transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections is likely to occur.

TI Factors influencing the effectiveness of malaria control in Bioko
   Island, equatorial Guinea
AB The Bioko Island Malaria Control Project (BIMCP) has carried out intensive interventions since early 2004 to reduce malaria transmission through indoor residual spraying (IRS) and case management. Annual parasite prevalence surveys have been carried out to monitor the effectiveness of the program. Significant overall reductions in prevalence of infection have been observed, with 42% fewer infections occurring in 2006 compared with baseline. Nevertheless, there is evidence of considerable heterogeneity in impact of the intervention. Prevalence of infection was significantly associated with spray status of the child's house, spray coverage with effective insecticide of the neighborhood of the house, bed net use, and time elapsed since last spray. Careful scheduling of spray coverage is therefore essential to maximize the effectiveness of IRS and to ensure consistent reductions in parasite prevalence. This can only be achieved if comprehensive monitoring systems are in place for both the management and evaluation of the intervention.

TI High frequency of recombination-driven allelic diversity and temporal
   variation of Plasmodium falciparum MSP1 in Tanzania
AB A major mechanism for the generation allelic diversity in the Plasmodium falciparum msp1 gene is meiotic recombination in the Anopheles mosquito. The frequency of recombination events is dependent on the intensity of transmission. Herein we investigate the frequency of recombination-driven allelic diversity and temporal variation of msp1 in Rufiji, eastern coastal Tanzania, where malaria transmission is intense. We identified 5' recombinant types, 3' sequence types, and msp1 haplotypes (unique associations of 5' recombinant types and 3' sequence types) to measure the extent and temporal variation of msp1 allelic diversity. The results show that msp1 haplotype diversity is higher in Tanzania as compared with areas with lower transmission rates. The frequencies of individual polymorphic regions/sites remained stable during the study period. However, the frequency distribution of msp1 haplotypes varied between 1993 and 1998. These results suggest that frequent recombination events between msp1 alleles intermittently generate novel alleles in high transmission areas.

DNA was purified from 90 isolates, and from these, 21 fragments corresponding to Pfcsp and 69 fragments corresponding to the 3'-end conserved domain were amplified and sequenced. Overall diversity was low. Six patterns were noted for the repeat region, but mixed genotypes were not observed in any of the isolates. T cell epitopes also displayed limited diversity, with only five haplotypes (combined Th2R/Th3R epitopes) noted, and of these, three were dominant, accounting for 94% of the 90 sequences. These observations are akin to those observed in Thai P. falciparum isolates, where a particular Pfscp Th2R/Th3R haplotype seems to be maintained in an otherwise genetically diverse parasite population. The data imply that the selective pressure that maintains a restricted T cell epitope is caused by factors outside the mammalian host immune responses. Furthermore, they sustain the notion that protective responses induced by RTS,S vaccination are not strain-specific.

TI Genetic control of malaria parasite transmission: Threshold levels for
   infection in an avian model system
AB Genetic strategies for controlling malaria transmission based on engineering pathogen resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes are being tested in a number of animal models. A key component is the effector molecule and the efficiency with which it reduces parasite transmission. Single-chain antibodies (scFvs) that bind the circumsporozoite protein of the avian parasite, Plasmodium gallinaceum, can reduce mean intensities of sporozoite infection of salivary glands by two to four orders of magnitude in transgenic Aedes aegypti. Significantly, mosquitoes with as few as 20 sporozoites in their salivary glands are infectious for a vertebrate host, Gallus gallus. Although scFvs hold promise as effector molecules, they will have to reduce mean intensities of infection to zero to prevent parasite transmission and disease. We conclude that similar endpoints must be reached with human pathogens if we are to expect an effect on disease transmission.

TI Seroprevalence of Chikungunya virus infection on Grande Comore Island,
   Union of the Comoros, 2005
AB An outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) illness associated with high fever combined with prolonged and severe arthralgias occurred on Grande Comore Island from January through May 2005; 5,202 cases were reported. A seroprevalence study was conducted to define the extent of transmission on the island. We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a multistage sampling technique. A total of 481 households were sampled. In each household, one resident was selected randomly for interview and blood collection. We administered questionnaires and tested 331 sera for CHIKV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Infection with CHIKV infection (seropositivity) was defined as presence of IgG and/or IgM antibodies to CHIKV. A total of 331 (69%) of 481 survey participants consented to blood collection. Antibodies to CHIKV were detected in 63% of sera; IgM antibodies were found in 60% of specimens and IgG antibodies were detected in 27% of specimens. Extrapolation of the findings to the entire Grande Comore population suggested that nearly 215,000 people were infected with CHIKV during the outbreak. A total of 79% of the seropositive persons were hospitalized or stayed at home in bed for a mean of 6 days (range = 1-30 days); 52% missed work or school for a mean of 7 days (range = 1-40 days). The findings suggest that CHIKV was broadly transmitted during the outbreak with a high attack rate. Although not fatal during this outbreak, CHIKV infection caused significant morbidity and decreased economic productivity.

TI Gene flow reverses an adaptive cline in a coevolving host-parasitoid
   interaction
AB Many natural populations are characterized by clinal patterns of adaptation, but it is unclear how gene flow and environmental gradients interact to drive such clines. We addressed this question by directly manipulating dispersal and productivity in an experimental landscape containing a microbial parasitoid, the bacteriophage T7, and its host, the bacterium Escherichia coli. We observed that the adaptation of parasitoids increased on hosts originating from lower-productivity communities in the absence of gene flow. However, adaptation decreased along the same productivity gradient with experimentally imposed gene flow of the host and parasitoid. This occurred despite relatively low rates of gene flow.

TI The conservation relevance of epidemiological research into carnivore
   viral diseases in the Serengeti
AB Recent outbreaks of rabies and canine distemper in wildlife populations of the Serengeti show that infectious disease constitutes a. significant cause of mortality that can result in regional extirpation of endangered species even within large, well-protected areas. Nevertheless, effective management of an infectious disease depends critically on understanding the epidemiological dynamics of the causative pathogen. Pathogens with short infection cycles cannot persist in small populations in the absence of a more permanent reservoir of infection. Development of appropriate interventions requires detailed data on transmission pathways between reservoirs and wildlife populations of conservation concern. Relevant data can be derived from long-term population monitoring, epidemic and case-surveillance patterns, genetic analyses of rapidly evolving pathogens, serological surveys, and intervention studies. We examined studies of carnivore diseases in the Serengeti. Epidemiological research contributes to wildlife conservation policy in terms of management of endangered populations and the integration of wildlife conservation with public health interventions. Longterm, integrative, cross-species research is essential for formulation of effective policy for disease control and optimization of ecosystem health.

TI Modeling the impact of Ebola and bushmeat hunting on western lowland
   gorillas
AB The 2003 outbreak of Ebola in the Republic of Congo killed 114 people and up to 800 western lowland gorillas. This outbreak and all outbreaks between 2001-2003 began with human handling of infected animal carcasses. Ebola has since spread, putting the entire gorilla population at risk. An epidemiological model is presented to describe the combined effects of Ebola and hunting on persistence of gorillas. The number of infected gorillas also provides a means of assessing the risk of transmission to humans. Under current harvest practices and the estimated annual outbreak rate, the gorilla population is predicted to undergo a 97 % decline within 100 years. Controlling bushmeat hunting may not be enough to prevent extinction if frequent outbreaks occur.

TI Minority-variant pfcrt K76T mutations and chloroquine resistance, Malawi
AB Genotyping of the chloroquine-resistance biomarker pfcrt (Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene) suggests that, in the absence of chloroquine pressure, Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Malawi have reverted to chloroquine sensitivity. However, malaria infections in Africa are commonly polyclonal, and standard PCRs cannot detect minority genotypes if present in < 20% of the parasites in an individual host. We have developed a multiple site-specific heteroduplex tracking assay (MSS-HTA) that can detect pfcrt 76T mutant parasites consisting of as little as 1% of the parasite population. In clinical samples, no pfcrt 76T was detected in 87 pregnant Malawian women by standard PCR. However, 22 (25%) contained minority-variant resistant genotypes detected by the MSS-HTA. These results were confirmed by subcloning and sequencing. This finding suggests that the chloroquine-resistant genotype remains common in Malawians and that PCR-undetectable drug-resistant genotypes may be present in disease-endemic populations. Surveillance for minority-variant drug-resistant mutations may be useful in making antimalarial drug policy.

TI Costs of resistance in the Drosophila-macrocheles system: A negative
   genetic correlation between ectoparasite resistance and reproduction
AB Genetic variation for parasite resistance occurs in most host populations. Costs of resistance, manifested as reduced fitness of resistant genotypes in the absence of parasitism, can be an important factor contributing to the maintenance of this variation. One powerful tool for detecting costs of resistance is the study of correlated responses to artificial selection. Provided that experimental lines are recently derived from large outbreeding populations, and that inbreeding is minimized during the experiment, correlated responses to selection are expected to be strong indicators of pleiotropy. We artificially selected for elevated behavioral resistance against an ectoparasitic mite (Macrocheles subbadius) in replicate populations of the fly Drosophila nigrospiracula. Resistance was modeled as a threshold trait, and the realized heritability of resistance was estimated to be 12.3% (1.4% SE) across three replicate lines recently derived from nature. We contrasted the longevity and fecundity of resistant and control (unselected) flies under a variable thermal environment. We report that reduced fecundity is a correlated response to artificial selection for increased resistance, and that the strength of this effect increases from 25 degrees to 29 degrees C. In contrast, longevity differences were not detected between resistant and control lines at either temperature. These findings are robust as they were confirmed with an independent set of experimental lines. Thus, our results identify a negative genetic correlation between ectoparasite resistance and an important life-history trait. That a correlated response was only detected for fecundity, and not longevity, suggests that the genetic correlation is attributable to pleiotropic effects with narrower effects than reallocation of a general resource pool within the organism, although other interpretations are discussed. Combined with fluctuating parasite-mediated selection and temperature, the presence of this trade-off may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation for resistance in natural populations.

TI The multifarious effects of dispersal and gene flow on contemporary
   adaptation
AB 1. Dispersal and gene flow can have a variety of interacting effects on evolution. These effects can either promote or constrain adaptive divergence through either genetic or demographic routes. The relative importance of these effects is unknown because few attempts have been made to conceptually integrate and test them.
   2. We draw a broad distinction between situations with vs. without strong coevolutionary dynamics. This distinction is important because the adaptive peak for a given population is more mobile in the former than in the latter. This difference makes ongoing evolutionary potential more important in the presence of strong coevolutionary dynamics than in their absence.
   3. We advance a conceptual integration of the various effects of gene flow and dispersal on adaptive divergence. In line with other authors, but not necessarily for the same reasons, we suggest that an intermediate level of gene flow will allow the greatest adaptive divergence.
   4. When dispersal is quite low, we predict that an increase will have positive effects on adaptive divergence, owing to genetic/demographic rescue and 'reinforcement.' The rescue effect may be more important in small populations and in homogeneous environments. The reinforcement effect may be more common in large populations and in heterogeneous environments.
   5. Once a certain level of dispersal is reached, we predict that a further increase may have negative effects on adaptive divergence. These effects may arise if carrying capacity is exceeded or maladaptive genes are introduced.
   Many additional effects remain to be integrated into this framework, and doing so may yield novel insights into the factors influencing evolution on ecological time-scales.

TI Plasticity of predation behaviour as a putative driving force for
   parasite life-cycle dynamics: the case of urban foxes and Echinococcus
   multilocularis tapeworm
AB 1. Parasite transmission frequently depends on an intermediate host species being subject to predation by a definitive host. We hypothesized that the population dynamics of this type of parasite would be affected by plasticity of the predation behaviour of the final host.
   2. The zoonotic tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis Leuckart is transmitted to foxes (Vulpes vulpes L.) by predation on infected rodents. One possible mechanism underlying the significant decrease in the prevalence of E. multilocularis in red foxes observed towards the centre of Zurich (Switzerland) is that the relative abundance of intermediate hosts varies between different urbanized habitats.
   3. The water vole, Arvicola terrestris scherman L., which is the major intermediate host, was less abundant in urban compared with peri-urban areas, due to both a reduced availability of suitable habitats and lower numbers within those habitats. Stomach content analyses indicated that foxes in urban areas consumed more anthropogenic food but preyed less frequently on rodents - and those rodents taken belonged to species less susceptible to E. multilocularis infection.
   4. We conclude that the functional response of final hosts to changes in supply of intermediate hosts and alternative food sources can significantly affect the transmission dynamic of dixenous parasites, such as this zoonotic tapeworm.

TI Is there a trade-off between aggressiveness and overwinter survival in
   Phytophthora infestans?
AB 1. Selection during interepidemic stages is crucial for the evolution of pathogen populations. Trade-offs involving aggressiveness (quantitative pathogenicity) have rarely been explored in pathogens with a life cycle requiring the disease-causing organism to change organs within the same host.
   2. We investigated the existence of a trade-off between aggressiveness and survival in Phytophthora infestans, the pathogen causing potato late blight. In France, P. infestans behaves as an obligate biotroph, surviving in infected tubers. Aggressive isolates, which are favoured during the epidemic, may exhaust their nutrient supply too quickly to bridge seasons, resulting in a possible trade-off between the two life stages.
   3. We inoculated tubers with isolates possessing different aggressiveness levels, let them overwinter as outdoor piles at three different sites, and scored the proportion of live tubers the following spring.
   4. At two sites, infection caused early tuber sprouting, which can be seen either as a manipulation of the host by the pathogen, or as an attempt by the host to escape.
   5. Overwinter survival was higher for control than for inoculated tubers, but did not differ between tubers inoculated with different isolates. This suggests that aggressiveness should gradually increase in P. infestans populations, unless a trade-off occurs at another stage of the life cycle.

TI Immune reconstitution syndrome associated with opportunistic mycoses
AB Host immunity is essential in facilitating the eradication of infection. However, immunological recovery and an imbalance characterised by either suboptimum or excessive expression of immune responses can also be harmful to the host. Inflammatory responses triggered by rapid resolution of immunosuppression can lead to a series of localised and systemic reactions, termed immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS), that are often misconstrued as failure of specific antifungal therapy to eliminate the offending fungal pathogen. Recognition of IRS has become increasingly relevant in the context of our current use of potent immunosuppressive agents and immunostimulators that allow rapid manipulation of the immune system. Whereas the conceptual principles of IRS underscore the adverse effects of an overzealous and dysregulated immune response, they also support a role of immunotherapies to augment immunity if induction of endogenous responses is inadequate for the control of infection.

TI Modeling systems-level regulation of host immune responses
AB Many pathogens are able to manipulate the signaling pathways responsible for the generation of host immune responses. Here we examine and model a respiratory infection system in which disruption of host immune functions or of bacterial factors changes the dynamics of the infection. We synthesize the network of interactions between host immune components and two closely related bacteria in the genus Bordetellae. We incorporate existing experimental information on the timing of immune regulatory events into a discrete dynamic model, and verify the model by comparing the effects of simulated disruptions to the experimental outcome of knockout mutations. Our model indicates that the infection time course of both Bordetellae can be separated into three distinct phases based on the most active immune processes. We compare and discuss the effect of the species-specific virulence factors on disrupting the immune response during their infection of naive, antibody-treated, diseased, or convalescent hosts. Our model offers predictions regarding cytokine regulation, key immune components, and clearance of secondary infections; we experimentally validate two of these predictions. This type of modeling provides new insights into the virulence, pathogenesis, and host adaptation of disease-causing microorganisms and allows systems-level analysis that is not always possible using traditional methods.

TI Fluctuation of abundance and Lassa virus prevalence in Mastomys
   natalensis in Guinea, West Africa
AB Based on empiric surveillance data, the incidence of human Lassa fever (LF) cases in Guinea and other West African countries has been reported to increase during the dry season compared to the rainy season. To investigate possible links with the ecology of the rodent reservoir of the virus, we conducted a 2-year longitudinal survey of Mastomys natalensis in a region of high human Lassa virus (LASV) seropositivity in Guinea. Standardized rodent trapping with similar trapping efforts between seasons was performed in three villages and 53.5% (601/1123) of the animals were identified as M. natalensis using morphometric and molecular criteria. Mean trapping success (TS) of M. natalensis was always higher inside houses than in proximal cultivations. In the dry season, mean TS increased 2-fold inside houses and decreased up to 10-fold outside (p < 0.0001), suggesting aggregation of rodents inside houses due to restricted food supply. 14.5% (80/553) of M. natalensis were tested positive for Lassa virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; range, 5%-30%) and prevalence of the virus was two to three times higher in rodents captured in the rainy season than in the dry season (p < 0.05). Inside houses, however, the LASV prevalence fluctuated nonsignificantly with season. These data suggest that in Guinea the risk of LASV transmission from rodents to humans is present both in the rainy and the dry season, reflected by the occurrence of LF cases throughout the year. In the dry season, however, the increased risk of humans encountering Mastomys and their excreta inside of houses may result in an increase of human Lassa fever cases.

TI Spatiotemporal distribution of diurnal yellow fever vectors (Diptera :

AB Yellow fever virus (YFV) remains a significant public health threat in sub-Saharan Africa in which 90% of the estimated 200,000 cases occur annually. In East Africa, human cases of YFV are characterized by unpredictable focal periodicity, lengthy inter-epidemic periods, and a precarious potential for large epidemics. YFV had remained undetected in this region for nearly 40 years until emerging in Kenya in 1992-93 and more recently in Sudan during 2003 and 2005. From an ecological perspective the emergence and epidemiological outcomes associated with YFV, and related vector-borne diseases, are critically dependent upon the underlying vector ecology at a local scale. The study here was aimed at defining the dynamics of important vector interactions at two important sites in Kenya with previous YFV or related arbovirus activity. The temporal abundance, spatial distribution, and human host seeking behavior of diurnal man-landing mosquito species along sylvan interfaces were investigated. A number of YFV vectors were identified including their abundances for the duration of the main rainy season. Spatially, results indicated that the greatest human-mosquito interactions occurred within the forest and decreased across more domesticated biotopes. A discussion of significant differences, ecological associations, and epidemiological implications is included.

TI Prevalence of Schistosoma japonicum infection among animals in fifty
   villages of Samar Province, the Philippines
AB In the Philippines, there is a need to understand the contribution of different domestic and wild animals in transmitting Schistosoma japonicum infection to humans better. The current study describes variation in animal S. japonicum prevalence across 50 endemic villages of Samar Province, the Philippines. A total of 50 villages were selected, 25 with predominantly rain-fed farms and 25 with some irrigation system. At least 35 cats, dogs, pigs, and water buffaloes each were randomly selected and 30 rat traps were set in each village. Fecal samples were collected for up to three consecutive days for each species. The Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory method (DBL method) was used to determine S. japonicum infection status. A hierarchical logistic regression model with clustering by village and with adjustment for measurement error of the DBL method was used to estimate the prevalence of infection per village and species. Stool samples were collected from 23.4% (1189), 28.6% (1274), 36.3% (1899), and 49.4% (873) of the censused dogs, cats, pigs, and water buffaloes, respectively, and from 663 rats. The adjusted prevalence of S. japonicum infection varied greatly across villages ranging from 1.6% (95% Bayesian Credible Interval: 0.1%-10.2%) to 86.3% (65.9%-97.8%) for dogs, from 0.1% (0%-2.1%) to 21.7% (4.7%-51.2%) for cats, from 0.01% (0.0%%-1.0%) to 18.4% (7.1%-34.7%) for pigs, from less than 0.1% (0.0%-1.2%) to 72.5% (46.0%-97.4%) for water buffaloes, and from 0.7% (0.0%-9.0%) to 95.4% (77.2%-99.9%) for rats. This is the most comprehensive study of animal S. japonicum infection conducted to date. Our results show that, unlike what has been reported in China, very few water buffaloes were infected whereas rats and dogs show high prevalence proportions of infection. This, combined with significant village-to-village variation in prevalence of S. japonicum infection, suggest possible different transmission dynamics of the infection in the Province of Samar in the Philippines and China.

TI Land cover variation and West Nile virus prevalence: Patterns,
   processes, and implications for disease control
AB Identifying links between environmental variables and infectious disease risk is essential to understanding how human-induced environmental changes will effect the dynamics of human and wildlife diseases. Although land cover change has often been tied to spatial variation in disease occurrence, the underlying factors driving the correlations are often unknown, limiting the applicability of these results for disease prevention and control. In this study, we described associations between land cover composition and West Nile virus (WNV) infection prevalence, and investigated three potential processes accounting for observed patterns: (1) variation in vector density; (2) variation in amplification host abundance; and (3) variation in host community composition. Interestingly, we found that WNV infection rates among Culex mosquitoes declined with increasing wetland cover, but wetland area was not significantly associated with either vector density or amplification host abundance. By contrast, wetland area was strongly correlated with host community composition, and model comparisons suggested that this factor accounted, at least partially, for the observed effect of wetland area on WNV infection risk. Our results suggest that preserving large wetland areas, and by extension, intact wetland bird communities, may represent a valuable ecosystem-based approach for controlling WNV outbreaks.

Samples were identified to species or as hybrid forms based on morphology of male terminalia. After 7 and 14 days of extrinsic incubation, few females were infected and none transmitted WNV from samples of Cx. p. pipiens from northern Shasta County and of Cx. p. quinquefasciatus from southern Los Angeles County. Seven days after infective feeding, 13%-36% of mosquitoes from the counties of Merced, Fresno, Kern, and San Bernardino were infected, and 12%-40% of infected mosquitoes expressed WNV in salivary expectorate. Fourteen days after infective feeding, 18%-43% of mosquitoes from these counties were infected, and 50%-69% of infected mosquitoes transmitted WNV in salivary expectorate. A sample of Cx. p. quinquefasciatus from Riverside County did not transmit WNV after 7 days, but 71% transmitted 14 days after infective feeding. These results reveal extensive geographic variation in vector competence for WNV in the Culex pipiens complex in California.

AB Rift Valley fever (RVF) is broadening its geographic range and is increasingly becoming a disease of global importance with potentially severe consequences for human and animal health. We conducted a spatial risk assessment of RVF in Senegal using serologic data from 16,738 animals in 211 locations. Bayesian spatial regression models were developed with interpolated seasonal rainfall, land surface temperature, distance to perennial water bodies, and time of year entered as fixed-effect variables. Average total monthly rainfall during December-February was the most important spatial predictor of risk of positive RVF serologic status. Maps derived from the models highlighted the lower Senegal River basin and the southern border regions of Senegal as high-risk areas. These risk maps are suitable for use in planning improved sentinel surveillance systems in Senegal, although further data collection is required in large areas of Senegal to better define the spatial distribution of RVF.

The most frequently infected rodents were: Akodon azarae (31/459), Necromys benefactus (8/141), and Oligoryzomys flavescens (10/281), which are known hosts of Pergamino, Maciel, and Lechiguanas hantaviruses, respectively. Relative population density and antibody prevalence varied seasonally and from year to year, population densities were highest in fall and prevalences were highest in spring. A positive association between antibody prevalence and body weight corroborated findings from other studies suggesting that hantaviruses are maintained in reservoir populations by horizontal transmission. In two of three host species, transmission was more frequent among male than among female mice. We found no evidence for a detrimental effect of hantavirus infection on host body weight, growth, longevity, movement, or reproductive preparedness. This analysis, based on cryopreserved specimens, represents the earliest conducted longitudinal, mark-recapture study of the dynamics of infection of autochthonous American hantaviruses in their sigmodontine host populations.

TI Seasonality of influenza in Brazil: A traveling wave from the Amazon to
   the subtropics
AB Influenza circulation and mortality impact in tropical areas have not been well characterized. The authors studied the seasonality of influenza throughout Brazil, a geographically diverse country, by modeling influenza-related mortality and laboratory surveillance data. Monthly time series of pneumonia and influenza mortality were obtained from 1979 to 2001 for each of the 27 Brazilian states. Detrended time series were analyzed by Fourier decomposition to describe the amplitude and timing of annual and semiannual epidemic cycles, and the resulting seasonal parameters were compared across latitudes, ranging from the equator (+5 degrees N) to the subtropics (-35 degrees S). Seasonality in mortality was most pronounced in southern states (winter epidemics, June-July), gradually attenuated toward central states (15 degrees S) (p < 0.001), and remained low near the equator. A seasonal southward traveling wave of influenza was identified across Brazil, originating from equatorial and low-population regions in March-April and moving toward temperate and highly populous regions over a 3-month period. Laboratory surveillance data from recent years provided independent confirmation that mortality peaks coincided with influenza virus activity. The direction of the traveling wave suggests that environmental forces (temperature, humidity) play a more important role than population factors (density, travel) in driving the timing of influenza epidemics across Brazil.

TI Experimental evolution of parasite life-history traits in Strongyloides
   ratti (Nematoda)
AB Evolutionary ecology predicts that parasite life-history traits, including a parasite's survivorship and fecundity within a host, will evolve in response to selection and that their evolution will be constrained by trade-offs between traits. Here, we test these predictions using a nematode parasite of rats, Strongyloides ratti, as a model. We performed a selection experiment by passage of parasite progeny from either early in an infection ('fast' lines) or late in an infection ('slow' lines). We found that parasite fecundity responded to selection but that parasite survivorship did not. We found a trade-off mediated via conspecific density-dependent constraints; namely, that fast lines exhibit higher density-independent fecundity than slow lines, but fast lines suffered greater reduction in fecundity in the presence of density-dependent constraints than slow lines. We also found that slow lines both stimulate a higher level of IgG1, which is a marker for a Th2-type immune response, and show less of a reduction in fecundity in response to IgG1 levels than for fast lines. Our results confirm the general prediction that parasite life-history traits can evolve in response to selection and indicate that such evolutionary responses may have significant implications for the epidemiology of infectious disease.

Unfortunately, the morphologic identification of these important disease vectors is often difficult, particularly in regions of sympatry. We developed a sensitive real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction assay that allows reliable identification of Cudex mosquitoes including Culex pipiens pipiens, Cx. p. quinquefasciatus, Cx. restuans, Cx. salinarius, Cx. nigripalpus, and Cx. tarsalis. Primers and fluorogenic probes specific to each species were designed based on sequences of the acetylcholinesterase gene (Ace2). Both immature and adult mosquitoes were successfully identified as individuals and as mixed species pools. This identification technique provides the basis for a rapid, sensitive, and high-throughput method for expounding the species-specific contribution of vectors to various phases of arbovirus transmission.

   the epidemic mosquito vector, Aedes taeniorhynchus
AB The mosquito Aedes taeniorhynchus is an important epidemic vector of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), but detailed studies of its infection are lacking. We compared infection by an epidemic VEEV strain to that by an enzootic strain using virus titrations, immunohistochemistry, and a virus expressing the green fluorescent protein. A e. taeniorhynchus was more susceptible to the epidemic strain, which initially infected the posterior midgut and occasionally the anterior midgut and cardia. Once dissemination beyond the midgut occurred, virus was present in nearly all tissues. Transmission of the epidemic strain to mice was first detected 4 days after infection. In contrast, the enzootic strain did not efficiently infect midgut cells but replicated in muscles and nervous tissue on dissemination. Because VEEV emergence can depend on adaptation to epidemic vectors, these results show that epidemic/enzootic strain comparisons not only comprise a useful model system to study alphavirus transmission by mosquitoes, but also have important public health implications.

   Bartonella in wild rodents
AB The study of ecological differences among coexisting microparasites has been largely neglected, but it addresses important and unusual issues because there is no clear distinction in such cases between conventional (resource) and apparent competition. Here patterns in the population dynamics are examined for four species of Bartonella (bacterial parasites) coexisting in two wild rodent hosts, bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Using generalized linear modeling and mixed effects models, we examine. for these four species, seasonal patterns and dependencies on host density (both direct and delayed) and, having accounted for these, any differences in prevalence between the two hosts. Whereas previous studies had failed to uncover species differences, here all four were different. Two, B. doshiae and B. taylorii, were more prevalent in wood mice, and one, B. birtlesii, was more prevalent in bank voles. B. birtlesii, B. grahamii, and B. taylorii peaked in prevalence in the fall, whereas B. doshiae peaked in spring. For B. birtlesii in bank voles, density dependence was direct, but for B. taylorii in wood mice density dependence was delayed. B. birtlesii prevalence in wood mice was related to bank vole density. The implications of these differences for species coexistence are discussed.

Oxytropis sericea is a perennial legume responsible for livestock poisoning in western North America. Livestock poisoning is attributed to the alkaloid swainsonine, which is synthesized inside the plant by the fungal endophyte Embellisia sp. In this study, the ability of Oxytropis sericea to form a dinitrogen-fixing symbiosis with Rhizobium and the effects of this symbiosis on the production of swainsonine by Embellisia sp. were evaluated in a greenhouse environment. Seeds of O. sericea were grown in plastic containers. Twenty-week-old O. sericea seedlings were inoculated with four strains of Rhizobium. Twenty weeks after inoculation, plant growth and root nodulation by Rhizobium were measured. Dinitrogen fixation was confirmed using an acetylene reduction assay (ARA) on excised root nodules. Dry leaves were analyzed for swainsonine content. A second set of plants was treated with fungicide to evaluate the effect of reduced fungal endophyte infection on plant growth and swainsonine production. All inoculated plants produced indeterminate nodules. The ARA indicated that 98% of the excised nodules were fixing dinitrogen. Rhizobium-treated plants had greater swainsonine concentrations than the non-inoculated controls. Plants that established from seeds treated with fungicide had lower biomass than non-fungicide-treated controls and plants treated with foliar fungicide. Plants treated with foliar fungicide and the controls had greater swainsonine concentrations than the plants that received seed fungicide. This greenhouse study is the first report of nodulation and dinitrogen fixation in O. sericea. It also demonstrates that dinitrogen fixation increases the production of swainsonine in O. sericea plants infected with Embellisia sp. Results from this study suggest that dinitrogen fixation affects swainsonine production and has the potential to support the symbiosis between Embellisia sp. and O. sericea when soil nitrogen is limited. Oxytropis sericea competitiveness appears to be facilitated by an ability to simultaneously associate with Rhizohium and a fungal symbiont.

TI Review and critical discussion of assumptions and modelling options to
   study the spread of the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) within a
   cattle herd
AB Relevance of epidemiological models depends on assumptions on the population structure and dynamics, on the biology of the host parasite interactiom, and on mathematical modelling. In this paper we reviewed published models of the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) spread within a herd. Modelling options and assumptions on herd dynamics and BVDV transmission were discussed. A cattle herd is a population with a controlled size. Animals are separated into subgroups according to their age or their physiological status inducing heterogeneity of horizontal transmission. Complexity of models results from: (1) horizontal and vertical virus transmission, (2) birth of persistently infected animals, (3) excretion by transiently and persistently infected animals. Areas where there was a lack of knowledge were identified. Assumptions on the force of infection used to model the horizontal virus transmission were presented and discussed. We proposed possible ways of improving models (e.g. force of infection, validation) and essential model features for further BVDV models.

TI Transmission of bovine leukaemia virus within dairy herds by simulation
   modelling
AB In Argentina, bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infection is common in dairy herds. The country currently has a National Voluntary Control Programme but relatively few farms have enrolled. However, there is increased interest from authorities and farmers to implement regional compulsory programmes but there is scarce quantitative information of the transmission of BLV in cattle herds. This information is a prerequisite to develop effective BLV control strategies. Mathematical modelling offers ways of integrating population-level knowledge and epidemiological data to predict the outcomes of intervention scenarios. The purpose of the current paper is to gain understanding about the dynamics of the transmission of BLV in dairy herds from Argentina by simulation and to compare various BLV transmission models and select the one that is most appropriate. The hypothetical herd is conceptually described in terms of BLV status as a population of individuals that are protected by maternal antibodies (M), that are susceptible (S), that are in the latent period (E) or that are infectious (1). BLV is spread by horizontal and vertical transmission. We used an age-structured population model and within-herd transmission was simulated by Monte Carlo techniques. The next-generation approach has been used for the systematic computation of the basic reproduction ratio (RO). Parameter values for disease transmission were derived from previously published data; rates of entry, exit or transition between age groups were calculated based on our previous study, observational data, expert opinions and literature. With these parameter values the probability of a minor outbreak was estimated to be 10 %, the probability of extinction was estimated as < 0.001 % and the expected time to extinction as more than 80 years. The probability of a minor outbreak and changes in prevalence were different when the index case was an adult cow compared to introduction by a heifer. Prediction of prevalences from MSI models fit the data satisfactorily. R-0 was estimated as 9.5. The sensitivity analysis on R, showed that all measures directed to reduce the transmission rate are potentially effective given operational control measures. An important prediction of these models is that, even in a relatively small, closed dairy herd, the time-scale for a BLV outbreak may be as long as several years and within-herd control of BLV requires intensive efforts.

TI Evolutionary diversification through hybridization in a wild
   host-pathogen interaction
AB Coevolutionary outcomes between interacting species are predicted to vary across landscapes, as environmental conditions, gene flow, and the strength of selection vary among populations. Using a combination of molecular, experimental, and field approaches, we describe how broad-scale patterns of environmental heterogeneity, genetic divergence, and regional adaptation have the potential to influence coevolutionary processes in the Linum marginale-Melampsora lini plant-pathogen interaction. We show that two genetically and geographically divergent pathogen lineages dominate interactions with the host across Australia, and demonstrate a hybrid origin for one of the lineages. We further demonstrate that the geographic divergence of the two lineages of M. lini in Australia is related to variation among lineages in virulence, life-history characteristics, and response to environmental conditions. When correlated with data describing regional patterns of variation in host resistance diversity and mating system these observations highlight the potential for gene flow and geographic selection mosaics to generate and maintain coevolutionary diversification in long-standing host-pathogen interactions.

TI Variable epistatic effects between mutations at host recognition sites
   in phi x174 bacteriophage
AB Epistatic interactions between mutations are widespread. Theoretical investigations have shown that variability in epistatic effects influences fundamental evolutionary processes, yet few empirical studies have identified causes or the extent of this variation. We examined variation in epistatic effects of mutations at two host recognition sites in phi X174 bacteriophage. We calculated epistatic effects from the sum of fitness effects (log scale) of two single mutants and their corresponding double mutant for five combinations of mutations in six conditions. We found that epistatic effects differed in sign, degree, and variability across conditions. The data highlight that even between single mutations at the same two sites the sign and variability of epistatic effects are affected by environment. We discuss these findings in the context of studying the role of epistasis in evolution.

TI Evolutionary adaptation to environmental ph in experimental lineages of
   Escherichia coli
AB This study uses the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli as an experimental system to examine evolutionary responses of bacteria to an environmental acidic-alkaline range between pH 5.3 and 7.8 (15-5000 nM [H+]). Our goal was both to test general hypotheses about adaptation to abiotic variables and to provide insights into how coliform organisms might respond to changing conditions inside and outside of hosts. Six replicate lines of E. coli evolved for 2000 generations at one of four different constant pH conditions: pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, or 7.8. Direct adaptation to the evolutionary environment, as well as correlated changes in other environments, was measured as a change in fitness relative to the ancestor in direct competition experiments. The pH 5.3 group had the highest fitness gains, with a highly significant increase of 20%. The pH 7.8 group had far less significant gains and much higher variance among its lines. Analysis of individual lines within these two groups revealed complex patterns of adaptation: all of the pH 5.3 lines exhibited trade-offs (reduced fitness in another environment), but only 33% of the pH 7.8 lines showed such trade-offs and one of the pH 7.8 lines demonstrated exaptation by improving fitness in the pH 5.3 environment. Although there was also prevalent exaptation in other groups to the acidic environment, there were no such cases of exaptation to alkalinity. Comparison across the entire experimental pH range revealed that the most acidic lines, the pH 5.3 group, were all specialists, in contrast to the pH 6.3 lines, which were almost all generalists. That is, although none of the pH 5.3 lines showed any correlated fitness gains, all of the pH 6.3 lines did.

TI Host sex and ectoparasites choice: preference for, and higher survival
   on female hosts
AB 1. Sex differences in levels of parasite infection are a common rule in a wide range of mammals, with males usually more susceptible than females. Sex-specific exposure to parasites, e.g. mediated through distinct modes of social aggregation between and within genders, as well as negative relationships between androgen levels and immune defences are thought to play a major role in this pattern.
   2. Reproductive female bats live in close association within clusters at maternity roosts, whereas nonbreeding females and males generally occupy solitary roosts. Bats represent therefore an ideal model to study the consequences of sex-specific social and spatial aggregation on parasites' infection strategies.
   3. We first compared prevalence and parasite intensities in a host-parasite system comprising closely related species of ectoparasitic mites (Spinturnix spp.) and their hosts, five European bat species. We then compared the level of parasitism between juvenile males and females in mixed colonies of greater and lesser mouse-eared bats Myotis myotis and M. blythii. Prevalence was higher in adult females than in adult males stemming from colonial aggregations in all five studied species. Parasite intensity was significantly higher in females in three of the five species studied. No difference in prevalence and mite numbers was found between male and female juveniles in colonial roosts.
   4. To assess whether observed sex-biased parasitism results from differences in host exposure only, or, alternatively, from an active, selected choice made by the parasite, we performed lab experiments on short-term preferences and long-term survival of parasites on male and female Myotis daubentoni. When confronted with adult males and females, parasites preferentially selected female hosts, whereas no choice differences were observed between adult females and subadult males. Finally, we found significantly higher parasite survival on adult females compared with adult males.
   5.Our study shows that social and spatial aggregation favours sex-biased parasitism that could be a mere consequence of an active and adaptive parasite choice for the more profitable host.

TI Quantifying the disease transmission function: effects of density on
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis transmission in the mountain
   yellow-legged frog Rana muscosa
AB 1. Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease of amphibians, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which has been implicated recently in population declines and possible extinctions throughout the world.
   2. The transmission rate of this pathogen was quantified in the mountain yellow-legged frog Rana muscosa through laboratory and field experiments, and a maximum likelihood approach was used to determine the form of the transmission function that was best supported by the experimental data.
   3. The proportion of R. muscosa tadpole hosts that became infected increased with the number of previously infected R. muscosa tadpoles to which they were exposed, as would be expected in an infectious disease.
   4. The laboratory experiment revealed some support for a transmission function in which the transmission rate levels off as the density of infected individuals increases. However, there was not enough power to distinguish between a frequency-dependent form and several other asymptotic forms of the transmission function.
   5. The impacts of crowding and temperature on transmission were also investigated; however, neither of these factors significantly affected the transmission rate.

   Rhynchosporium secalis
AB The origins of pathogens and their past and present migration patterns are often unknown. We used phylogenetic haplotype clustering in conjunction with model-based coalescent approaches to reconstruct the genetic history of the barley leaf pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis using the avirulence gene NIP1 and its flanking regions. Our results falsify the hypothesis that R. secalis emerged in association with its host during the domestication of barley 10 000 to 15 000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent and was introduced into Europe through the migration of Neolithic farmers. Estimates of time since most recent common ancestor (2500-5000 BP) placed the emergence of R. secalis clearly after the domestication of barley. We propose that modern populations of R. secalis originated in northern Europe following a host switch, most probably from a wild grass onto cultivated barley shortly after barley was introduced into northern Europe. R. secalis subsequently spread southwards into already established European barley-growing areas.

TI C1 inhibitor treatment improves host defense in pneumococcal meningitis
   in rats and mice
AB In spite of antibiotic treatment, pneumococcal meningitis continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The complement system is a key component of innate immunity against invading pathogens. However, activation of complement is also involved in tissue damage, and complement inhibition by C1 inhibitor ( C1-inh) is beneficial in animal models of endotoxemia and sepsis. In the present study, we demonstrate classical pathway complement activation during pneumococcal meningitis in rats. We also evaluate the effect of C1-inh treatment on clinical illness, bacterial clearance, and inflammatory responses in rats and mice with pneumococcal meningitis. C1-inh treatment was associated with reduced clinical illness, a less-pronounced inflammatory infiltrate around the meninges, and lower brain levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. C1-inh treatment increased bacterial clearance, possibly through an up-regulation of CR3. Hence, C1-inh may be a useful agent in the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis.

TI Clonal diversity of a lizard malaria parasite, Plasmodium mexicanum, in
   its vertebrate host, the western fence lizard: role of variation in
   transmission intensity over time and space
AB Within the vertebrate host, infections of a malaria parasite (Plasmodium) could include a single genotype of cells (single-clone infections) or two to several genotypes (multiclone infections). Clonal diversity of infection plays an important role in the biology of the parasite, including its life history, virulence, and transmission. We determined the clonal diversity of Plasmodium mexicanum, a lizard malaria parasite at a study region in northern California, using variable microsatellite markers, the first such study for any malaria parasite of lizards or birds (the most common hosts for Plasmodium species). Multiclonal infections are common (50-88% of infections among samples), and measures of genetic diversity for the metapopulation (expected heterozygosity, number of alleles per locus, allele length variation, and effective population size) all indicated a substantial overall genetic diversity. Comparing years with high prevalence (1996-1998 = 25-32% lizards infected), and years with low prevalence (2001-2005 = 6-12%) found fewer alleles in samples taken from the low-prevalence years, but no reduction in overall diversity (H = 0.64-0.90 among loci). In most cases, rare alleles appeared to be lost as prevalence declined. For sites chronically experiencing low transmission intensity (prevalence similar to 1%), overall diversity was also high (H = 0.79-0.91), but there were fewer multiclonal infections. Theory predicts an apparent excess in expected heterozygosity follows a genetic bottleneck. Evidence for such a distortion in genetic diversity was observed after the drop in parasite prevalence under the infinite alleles mutation model but not for the stepwise mutation model. The results are similar to those reported for the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, worldwide, and support the conclusion that malaria parasites maintain high genetic diversity in host populations despite the potential for loss in alleles during the transmission cycle or during periods/locations when transmission intensity is low.

TI Risk factors for human herpesvirus 8 infection among adults in the
   United States and evidence for sexual transmission
AB Background. Human herpesvirus 8 ( HHV- 8) causes Kaposi sarcoma. In the United States, transmission routes for HHV- 8 are uncertain.
   Methods. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III sampled individuals from the US general population ( 1988 - 1994). We used enzyme immunoassays ( EIAs) to measure HHV- 8 antibodies ( K8.1 and open reading frame [ ORF] 73 antigens) in 13,894 surveyed adults. HHV- 8 seroprevalence was examined according to sexual history and viral coinfection markers.
   Results. Overall, seroprevalence was low when a highly specific cutoff was used ( K8.1, 1.6%; ORF73, 1.5%) but was higher when a less- specific cutoff was used ( K8.1, 7.1%; ORF73, 7.4%). When the more- specific approach was used, K8.1 seroprevalence was similar in men and women. Men who have sex with men ( MSM) had a higher K8.1 seroprevalence ( 8.2%). Among other men, K8.1 seroprevalence was marginally associated with duration of heterosexual activity (P=.1) and was positively associated with the lifetime number of sex partners (P=.04) and with coinfections with hepatitis B virus ( 6.1% vs. 1.2% without coinfection;) and herpes simplex P <.001 virus 2 ( 2.7% vs. 1.0%; P=.003). Among women, K8.1 seroprevalence was not significantly related to duration Pp. 003 of sexual activity, the lifetime number of sex partners, or viral coinfections. The ORF73 EIA revealed similar but less clear- cut patterns.
   Conclusions. Among men, HHV- 8 transmission may occur through sexual activity, particularly sex with other men. No evidence was observed for heterosexual transmission to women.

TI Emergence of drug resistance: implications for antiviral control of
   pandemic influenza
AB Given the danger of an unprecedented spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 in humans, and great challenges to the development of an effective influenza vaccine, antiviral drugs will probably play a pivotal role in combating a novel pandemic strain. A critical limitation to the use of these drugs is the evolution of highly transmissible drug-resistant viral mutants. Here, we develop a mathematical model to evaluate the potential impact of an antiviral treatment strategy on the emergence of drug resistance and containment of a pandemic. The results show that elimination of the wild- type strain depends crucially on both the early onset of treatment in indexed cases and population-level treatment. Given the probable delay of 0.5-1 day in seeking healthcare and therefore initiating therapy, the findings indicate that a single strategy of antiviral treatment will be unsuccessful at controlling the spread of disease if the reproduction number of the wild- type strain dRs (R-0(s)) exceeds 1.4. We demonstrate the possible occurrence of a self-sustaining epidemic of resistant strain, in terms of its transmission fitness relative to the wild-type, and the reproduction number R-0(s). Considering reproduction numbers estimated for the past three pandemics, the findings suggest that an uncontrollable pandemic is likely to occur if resistant viruses with relative transmission fitness above 0.4 emerge. While an antiviral strategy is crucial for containing a pandemic, its effectiveness depends critically on timely and strategic use of drugs.

TI Host community structure and the maintenance of pathogen diversity
AB Community structure has been widely identified as a feature of many real-world networks. It has been shown that the antigenic diversity of a pathogen population can be significantly affected by the contact network of its hosts; however, the effects of community structure have not yet been explored. Here, we examine the congruence between patterns of antigenic diversity in pathogen populations in neighbouring communities, using both a deterministic metapopulation model and individual-based formulations. We show that the spatial differentiation of the pathogen population can only be maintained at levels of coupling far lower than that necessary for the host populations to remain distinct. Therefore, identifiable community structure in host networks may not reflect differentiation of the processes occurring upon them and, conversely, a lack of genetic differentiation between pathogens from different host communities may not reflect strong mixing between them.

TI DNA barcoding cannot reliably identify species of the blowfly genus
   Protocalliphora (Diptera : Calliphoridae)
AB In DNA barcoding, a short standardized DNA sequence is used to assign unknown individuals to species and aid in the discovery of new species. A fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 is emerging as the standard barcode region for animals. However, patterns of mitochondrial variability can be confounded by the spread of maternally transmitted bacteria that cosegregate with mitochondria. Here, we investigated the performance of barcoding in a sample comprising 12 species of the blow fly genus Protocalliphora, known to be infected with the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia. We found that the barcoding approach showed very limited success: assignment of unknown individuals to species is impossible for 60% of the species, while using the technique to identify new species would underestimate the species number in the genus by 75%. This very low success of the barcoding approach is due to the non-monophyly of many of the species at the mitochondrial level. We even observed individuals from four different species with identical barcodes, which is, to our knowledge, the most extensive case of mtDNA haplotype sharing yet described. The pattern of Wolbachia infection strongly suggests that the lack of within-species monophyly results from introgressive hybridization associated with Wolbachia infection. Given that Wolbachia is known to infect between 15 and 75% of insect species, we conclude that identification at the species level based on mitochondrial sequence might not be possible for many insects. However, given that Wolbachia-associated mtDNA introgression is probably limited to very closely related species, identification at the genus level should remain possible.

TI Endemic hantavirus infection impairs the winter survival of its rodent
   host
AB The influence of pathogens on host fitness is one of the key questions in infection ecology. Hantaviruses have coevolved with their hosts and are generally thought to have little or no effect on host survival or reproduction. We examined the effect of Puumala virus (PUUV) infection on the winter survival of bank voles (Myodes glareolus), the host of this virus. The data were collected by monitoring 22 islands over three consecutive winters (a total of 55 island populations) in an endemic area of central Finland. We show that PUUV infected bank voles had a significantly lower overwinter survival probability than antibody negative bank voles. Antibody negative female bank voles from low-density populations living on large islands had the highest survival. The results were similar at the population level as the spring population size and density were negatively correlated with PUUV prevalence in the autumn. Our results provide the first evidence for a significant effect of PUUV on host survival suggesting that haritaVIrtISes, and endemic pathogens in general, deserve even more attention in studies of host population dynamics.

TI Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus infection of cotton rats
AB Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an emerging pathogen of equids and humans, but infection of its rodent reservoir hosts has received little study. To determine whether responses to infection vary among geographic populations, we inoculated 3 populations of cotton rats with 2 enzootic VEEV strains (Co97-0054 [enzootic ID subtype] and 68U201 [enzootic IE subtype]). The 3 populations were offspring from wild-caught cotton rats collected in a VEE-enzootic area of south Florida, USA; wild-caught cotton rats from a non-VEE-enzootic area of Texas, USA; and commercially available (Harlan) colony-reared cotton rats from a non-VEE-enzootic region. Although each population had similar early viremia titers, no detectable disease developed in the VEE-sympatric Florida animals, but severe disease and death affected the Texas and Harlan animals. Our findings suggest that the geographic origins of cotton rats are important determinants of the outcome of VEE infection and reservoir potential of these rodents.

TI Environmental determinants of infectious disease: A framework for
   tracking causal links and guiding public health research
AB BACKGROUND: Discoveries that emerging and re-emerging pathogens have their origin in environmental change has created an urgent need to understand how these environmental changes impact disease burden. In this article we present a framework that provides a context from which to examine the relationship between environmental changes and disease transmission and a structure from which to unite disparate pieces of information from a variety of disciplines.
   METHODS: The framework integrates three interrelated characteristics of environment-disease relationships: a) Environmental change manifests in a complex web of ecologic and social factors that may ultimately impact disease; these factors are represented as those more distally related and those more proximally related to disease. b) Transmission dynamics of infectious pathogens mediate effects that environmental changes have on disease. c) Disease burden is the outcome of the inter play between environmental change and the transmission cycle of a pathogen.
   RESULTS: To put this framework into operation, we present a matrix formulation as a means to define important elements of this system and to summarize what is known and unknown about the these elements and their relationships. The framework explicitly expresses the problem at a systems level that goes beyond the traditional risk factor analysis used in public health, and the matrix provides a means to explicitly express the coupling of different system components.
   CONCLUSION: This coupling of environmental and disease transmission processes provides a much-needed construct for furthering our understanding of both specific and general relationships between environmental change and infectious disease.

TI Prevalence, spatial distribution and the effect of control measures on
   louping-ill virus in the Forest of Bowland, Lancashire
AB The complex pathogen-host vector system of the tick-borne louping-ill virus causes economic losses to sheep and red grouse in upland United Kingdom. This paper examines the spatial distribution, incidence and effect of control measures on louping-ill virus in the Bowland Fells of Lancashire. Seroprevalence in sheep at the beginning of the study varied within the area and was affected significantly by the frequency of acaricide treatment. There was a clear decrease over 5 years in the effective force of infection on farms implementing a vaccination programme, irrespective of acaricide treatment regime, however, only one third of farms apparently eliminated infection. On farms where vaccination did not occur or where vaccination was carried out intermittently, the estimated force of infection was variable or possibly increased. Thus, as befits a complex host-pathogen system, reductions in prevalence were not as dramatic as predicted; we discuss the potential explanations for these observations.

TI Direct and correlated responses to selection in a host-parasite system:
   Testing for the emergence of genotype specificity
AB Genotype x environment interactions can facilitate coexistence of locally adapted specialists. Interactions evolve if adaptation to one environment trades off with performance in others. We investigated whether evolution on one host genotype traded off with performance on others in long-term experimental populations of different genotypes of the protozoan Paramecium caudatum, infected with the bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. A total of nine parasite selection lines evolving on three host genotypes and the ancestral parasite were tested in a cross-infection experiment. We found that evolved parasites produced more infections than did the ancestral parasites, both on host genotypes they had evolved on (positive direct response to selection) and on genotypes they had not evolved on (positive correlated response to selection). On two host genotypes, a negative relationship between direct and correlated responses indicated pleiotropic costs of adaptation. On the third, a positive relationship suggested cost-free adaptation. Nonetheless, on all three hosts, resident parasites tended to be superior to the average nonresident parasite. Thus genotype specificity (i.e., patterns of local adaptation) may evolve without costs of adaptation, as long as direct responses to selection exceed correlated responses.

TI Clinal resistance structure and pathogen local adaptation in a
   serpentine flax-flax rust interaction
AB Because disease resistance is a hallmark signature of pathogen-mediated selection pressure on hosts, studies of resistance structure (the spatial distribution of disease resistance genes among conspecific host populations) can provide valuable insights into the influence of pathogens on host evolution and spatial variation in the magnitude of their effects. To date few studies of wild plant-pathogen interactions have characterized resistance structure by sampling across the host's biogeographic range, and only a handful have paired such investigations with studies of disease levels under natural conditions. I used a greenhouse cross-inoculation experiment to characterize genetic resistance of 16 populations of California dwarf flax (Hesperolinon californicum) to attack by multiple samples of the rust fungus Melampsora lini. I documented a latitudinal cline in resistance structure, manifest across the host's biogeographic range, which mirrored almost identically a cline in infection prevalence documented through field surveys of disease in study populations. These results provide empirical evidence for clinal patterns of antagonistic selection pressure, demonstrate that such patterns can be manifest across broad biogeographic scales, and suggest that rates of disease prevalence in wild plant populations may be tightly linked to the distribution of host resistance genes. Tests for local adaptation of the fungus revealed evidence of the phenomenon (significantly greater infection in sympatric plant-fungal pairings) as well as the potential for substantial bias to be introduced into statistical analyses by spatial patterns of host resistance structure.

TI Antagonistic coevolution mediated by phenotypic differences between
   quantitative traits
AB Many well-studied coevolutionary interactions between predators and prey or hosts and parasites are mediated by quantitative traits. In some interactions, such as those between cuckoos and their hosts, interactions are mediated by the degree of phenotype matching among species, and a significant body of theory has been developed to predict the coevolutionary dynamics and outcomes of such interactions. In a large number of other cases, however, interactions are mediated by the extent to which the phenotype of one species exceeds that of the other. For these cases-which are arguably more numerous-few theoretical predictions exist for coevolutionary dynamics and outcomes. Here we develop and analyze mathematical models of interspecific interactions mediated by the extent to which the quantitative trait of one species exceeds that of the other. Our results identify important differences from previously studied models based on trait matching. First, our results show that cyclical dynamics are possible only if the strength of coevolutionary selection exceeds a threshold and stabilizing selection acts on the interacting traits. Second, our results demonstrate that significant levels of genetic polymorphism can be maintained only when cyclical dynamics occur. This result leads to the unexpected prediction that maintenance of genetic polymorphism is enhanced by strong selection. Finally, our results demonstrate that there is no a priori reason to expect the traits of interacting species should match in any literal sense, even in the absence of gene flow among populations.

TI Weather-driven dynamics of an intermediate host: mechanistic and
   statistical population modelling of Oncomelania hupensis
AB 1. Population models of intermediate host species' abundance are vital tools for assessing the impacts of control activities and changing environmental conditions on host-parasite dynamics. Public health practitioners require reliable predictions to inform disease control decisions that target the intermediate host of human schistosomes. A synthesis of mechanistic and statistical modelling approaches was undertaken to develop a weather-driven mathematical population dynamics model for Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host for Schistosoma japonicum.
   2. The model was parameterized with data from a novel, longitudinal mark-recapture technique incorporating enclosures in order to distinguish birth from immigration and death from emigration. Snail density, recruitment and death rates were estimated monthly, and environmental variables recorded continuously at three sites in a mountainous region of south-western China.
   3. Generalized estimating equation models were used to relate birth and death parameters to lagged and unlagged environmental variables, clustered by site. Competing mechanistic models, combining these submodels, were assessed based on their prediction error against observed population dynamics. In the best-fit overall model, O. hupensis seasonal cycling was largely governed by temperature and episodic precipitation events > 15 mm, with characteristic early spring and late summer population peaks. Density-dependent effects were not detected.
   4. The implications for snail control and, in particular, the influence of human hydrological disturbances on snail populations were examined. The model quantified the response of O. hupensis to small changes in climate variables, providing vital data for assessing the potential impact of climate change on parasite intermediate host populations.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The results of this study can form the basis of management measures aimed at controlling the Asian intermediate host of a widespread human parasite, with relevance to nearly 30 million affected people. As a component of larger disease transmission models, a description of snail population dynamics is valuable both for explaining the patterns of occurrence of disease in natural populations, and for evaluating the relative impact of different environmental scenarios on host-parasite interactions. Having integrated the first direct measurements of O. hupensis population parameters in a validated, weather-driven population model, managers may now quantitatively evaluate the response of O. hupensis to changing environmental conditions, including environmental modifications designed to achieve population reductions. Results suggest that, in particular, the sensitivity of O. hupensis to heavy flow events can be exploited as a potential control technique.

AB Background. Transmitted drug-resistant HIV slowly reverts in the blood to drug- sensitive virus. The environment of the male genital tract (MGT) may result in even slower rates of reversion to drug susceptibility.
   Methods. We measured the decay of resistance in longitudinally collected blood and semen samples from 5 individuals newly infected with HIV containing resistance mutations to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). We also investigated the sexual transmission of HIV to and from these participants.
   Results. In 3 of the 5 individuals, NNRTI resistance persisted in blood and semen throughout follow-up ( mean, 296 days after the estimated day of infection [EDI]). In the other 2 individuals, NNRTI resistance persisted in blood and semen for 871 and 1179 days after the EDI; however, even after NNRTI resistance had fully reverted in blood, it remained readily detectable in semen. Two transmission groups were identified among these participants - one as the recipient partner and the other as the source partner.
   Conclusions. Transmitted drug-resistant HIV, which persists in blood for years, may revert to wild type even more slowly in the MGT. This prolonged persistence in the MGT may contribute to the high prevalence rates of transmitted drug resistance.

TI Monitoring the dynamics of the HIV epidemic using assays for recent
   infection and serotyping among new HIV diagnoses: Experience after 2
   years in France
AB Background. New tools to better monitor dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission are needed.
   Methods. National surveillance of newly HIV diagnoses included the collection of dried serum spots to identify both recent infections (< 6 months) and HIV serotypes. Multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with recent infection and infection with non- B subtypes.
   Results. Between 2003 and March 2005, 7902 new HIV diagnoses were reported. The overall proportion of recent infections was 24.9% (95% confidence interval, 23.8% - 26.0%) and was highest among men who have sex with men (MSM; 46%). Recent infection was associated with being an MSM, <30 years old, of French nationality, and living in Paris. Nearly half of newly HIV-1 diagnoses were with non- B subtypes. The highest proportion of non-B infections was reported among African heterosexual persons (81%), but important proportions were reported among French heterosexual persons (34%) and MSM (12%). Being infected by a non- B subtype was independently associated with being African, <30 years old, heterosexual, and living in Paris. The proportion of HIV-2 infection was 1.9%, and 11 cases of HIV-1 group O infection were identified, mainly among West Africans.
   Conclusions. There is evidence of high levels of HIV transmission among MSM in France and transmission of non- B subtypes within the indigenous French population.

TI Innate immunogenetics: a tool for exploring new frontiers of host
   defence
AB The discovery of innate immune genes, such as those encoding Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-like receptors (NLRs), and related signal-transducing molecules, has led to a substantial improvement of our understanding of innate immunity. Recent immunogenetic studies have associated polymorphisms of the genes encoding TLRs, NLRs, and key signal-transducing molecules, such as interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), with increased susceptibility to, or outcome of, infectious diseases. With the availability of high-throughput genotyping techniques, it is becoming increasingly evident that analyses of genetic polymorphisms of innate immune genes will further improve our knowledge of the host antimicrobial defence response and help in identifying individuals who are at increased risk of life-threatening infections. This is likely to open new perspectives for the development of diagnostic, predictive, and preventive management strategies to combat infectious diseases.

TI Within-population variation in prevalence and lineage distribution of
   avian malaria in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus
AB The development of molecular genetic screening techniques for avian blood parasites has revealed many novel aspects of their ecology, including greatly elevated diversity and complex host-parasite relationships. Many previous studies of malaria in birds have treated single study populations as spatially homogeneous with respect to the likelihood of transmission of malaria to hosts, and we have very little idea whether any spatial heterogeneity influences different malaria lineages similarly. Here, we report an analysis of variation in the prevalence and cytochrome b lineage distribution of avian malaria infection with respect to environmental and host factors, and their interactions, in a single blue tit (Cyanistes caemleus) population. Of 11 Plasmodium and Haemoproteus cytochrome b lineages found in 997 breeding individuals, the three most numerous (pSGS1, pTURDUS1 and pBT7) were considered separately, in addition to analyses of all avian malaria lineages pooled. Our analyses revealed marked spatial differences in the prevalence and distribution of these lineages, with local prevalence of malaria within the population ranging from over 60% to less than 10%. In addition, we found several more complex patterns of prevalence with respect to local landscape features, host state, parasite genotype, and their interactions. We discuss the implications of such heterogeneity in parasite infection at a local scale for the study of the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases in natural populations. The increased resolution afforded by the combination of molecular genetic and geographical information systems (GIS) tools has the potential to provide many insights into the epidemiology, evolution and ecology of these parasites in the future.

TI Population genetics of Plasmodium resistance genes in Anopheles gambiae:
   no evidence for strong selection
AB Anopheles mosquitoes are the primary vectors for malaria in Africa, transmitting the disease to more than 100 million people annually. Recent functional studies have revealed mosquito genes that are crucial for Plasmodium development, but there is presently little understanding of which genes mediate vector competence in the wild, or evolve in response to parasite-mediated selection. Here, we use population genetic approaches to study the strength and mode of natural selection on a suite of mosquito immune system genes, CTL4, CTLMA2, LRIM1, and APL2 (LRRD7), which have been shown to affect Plasmodium development in functional studies. We sampled these genes from two African populations of An. gambiae s.s., along with several closely related species, and conclude that there is no evidence for either strong directional or balancing selection on these genes. We highlight a number of challenges that need to be met in order to apply population genetic tests for selection in Anophelesmosquitoes; in particular the dearth of suitable outgroup species and the potential difficulties that arise when working within a closely-related species complex.

TI Helicobacter pylori evolution: Lineage-specific adaptations in homologs
   of eukaryotic Sel1-like genes
AB Geographic partitioning is postulated to foster divergence of Helicobacter pylori populations as an adaptive response to local differences in predominant host physiology. H. pylori's ability to establish persistent infection despite host inflammatory responses likely involves active management of host defenses using bacterial proteins that may themselves be targets for adaptive evolution. Sequenced H. pylori genomes encode a family of eight or nine secreted proteins containing repeat motifs that are characteristic of the eukaryotic Sel1 regulatory protein, whereas the related Campylobacter and Wolinella genomes each contain only one or two such " Sel1- like repeat'' ( SLR) genes (" slr genes''). Signatures of positive selection ( ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations, d(N)/d(S) = omega > 1) were evident in the evolutionary history of H. pylori slr gene family expansion. Sequence analysis of six of these slr genes ( hp0160, hp0211, hp0235, hp0519, hp0628, and hp1117) from representative East Asian, European, and African H. pylori strains revealed that all but hp0628 had undergone positive selection, with different amino acids often selected in different regions. Most striking was a divergence of Japanese and Korean alleles of hp0519, with Japanese alleles having undergone particularly strong positive selection ( omega(J) > 25), whereas alleles of other genes from these populations were intermingled. Homology- based structural modeling localized most residues under positive selection to SLR protein surfaces. Rapid evolution of certain slr genes in specific H. pylori lineages suggests a model of adaptive change driven by selection for fine- tuning of host responses, and facilitated by geographic isolation. Characterization of such local adaptations should help elucidate how H. pylori manages persistent infection, and potentially lead to interventions tailored to diverse human populations.

TI On state-space reduction in multi-strain pathogen models, with an
   application to antigenic drift in influenza A
AB Many pathogens exist in phenotypically distinct strains that interact with each other through competition for hosts. General models that describe such multi- strain systems are extremely difficult to analyze because their state spaces are enormously large. Reduced models have been proposed, but so far all of them necessarily allow for coinfections and require that immunity be mediated solely by reduced infectivity, a potentially problematic assumption. Here, we suggest a new state- space reduction approach that allows immunity to be mediated by either reduced infectivity or reduced susceptibility and that can naturally be used for models with or without coinfections. Our approach utilizes the general framework of status- based models. The cornerstone of our method is the introduction of immunity variables, which describe multi- strain systems more naturally than the traditional tracking of susceptible and infected hosts. Models expressed in this way can be approximated in a natural way by a truncation method that is akin to moment closure, allowing us to sharply reduce the size of the state space, and thus to consider models with many strains in a tractable manner. Applying our method to the phenomenon of antigenic drift in influenza A, we propose a potentially general mechanism that could constrain viral evolution to a one- dimensional manifold in a two- dimensional trait space. Our framework broadens the class of multi- strain systems that can be adequately described by reduced models. It permits computational, and even analytical, investigation and thus serves as a useful tool for understanding the evolution and ecology of multi- strain pathogens.

TI Genetically resistant sheep avoid parasites to a greater extent than do
   susceptible sheep
AB Livestock breeding programmes have created resistant (R) and susceptible (S) sheep that differ in their ability to control parasites through their immune function but potentially also their grazing behaviour (i. e. parasite avoidance). Using the Perendale genetic lines, we tested the hypothesis that R-sheep avoid parasites more effectively, reducing their parasite exposure/challenge, compared with S-sheep. However, in grazing systems, parasite-rich areas are also forage rich, suggesting that parasite avoidance behaviours are associated with nutritional penalties. We first created a naturally heterogeneous sward structure of gaps and tussocks and then used focal behavioural observations to quantify the sward selection of R- and S-sheep. Tussock swards were more nitrogen rich (41%), offered increased forage intake rates (32%) and contained 17 times more parasite larvae than gap swards. All the animals avoided grazing the tussock swards. However, the R- sheep grazed the tussock swards to a lesser degree than the S-sheep. We conclude that selection for genetic resistance has resulted in animals that, despite being well armed to fight parasitism through improved immune function, adopt parasite avoidance strategies with associated nutritional disadvantages. This experiment highlights the role of host behaviour in the control of parasitism and suggests that animals can be bred to avoid disease.

TI Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 subtype c melanesian genetic variants
   of the vanuatu archipelago and solomon islands share a common ancestor
AB Background. Melanesia is endemic for human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) subtype C. In 2005, we identified 4 infected women from Ambae Island, Vanuatu. Subsequently, 4247 Ni-Vanuatu originating from 18 islands were enrolled to define HTLV-1 epidemiological determinants and to characterize the viral strains molecularly.
   Methods. Plasma from 1074 males and 3173 females were screened for HTLV-1/2 antibodies by particle agglutination (PA) and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Positive and/or borderline samples were then tested by a Western blot (WB) confirmatory assay. DNAs were amplified to obtain a 522-bp env gene fragment. Phylogenetic and molecular-clock analyses were performed.
   Results. Of 4247 samples, 762 were positive and/or borderline by IFA/PA, and 26 of them were confirmed to be HTLV-1 positive by WB. The overall HTLV-1 seroprevalence was 0.62%. Viral transmission was found within families of infected index case patients. A geographic heterogeneity of HTLV-1 seroprevalence was observed among the islands. All 41 of the new env sequences belonged to HTLV-1 subtype C. Phylogenetic and molecular-clock analyses suggested that Ni-Vanuatu and Solomon Islander strains emerged from a common ancestor similar to 10,000 years ago.
   Conclusion. The Vanuatu archipelago is endemic for HTLV-1 with a diversity of subtype C variants. These strains were probably introduced into Vanuatu during ancient migration of the original settlers a few thousand years ago.

TI Facing the crisis: Improving the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the HIV
   era
AB Although the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on tuberculosis (TB) control efforts, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, most of the fundamental concepts reflected in the directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy still hold true in the HIV era. What has changed, and dramatically, is the importance of speedy and accurate TB diagnosis and the difficulty of achieving this. The disproportionate amount of smear-negative disease in sub-Saharan Africa, which shoulders two-thirds of the global burden of HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, has greatly complicated TB case detection and disease control. Now, 15 years after TB rates began to soar in countries where HIV infection is prevalent, we have learned that the conventional approach-passively waiting for patients with advanced symptomatic disease to make their way to microscopy centers for diagnosis-has disastrous consequences. Without better diagnostic tools for TB and effective strategies for their implementation, transmission will not be interrupted, mortality will not be checked, and TB will not be controlled in areas where HIV infection is prevalent. Fortunately, a number of technical opportunities exist for the creation of improved diagnostic tests. Developing and exploiting such tests to support TB control in HIV-infected populations is an urgent priority. A substantial public sector effort is under way to work in partnership with the biotechnology industry to accelerate progress toward that goal. In this article, we will define the need for better TB tests and describe technologies being developed to meet that need.

TI Climatically driven synchrony of gerbil populations allows large-scale
   plague outbreaks
AB In central Asia, the great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) is the main host for the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague. In order to prevent plague outbreaks, monitoring of the great gerbil has been carried out in Kazakhstan since the late 1940s. We use the resulting data to demonstrate that climate forcing synchronizes the dynamics of gerbils over large geographical areas. As it is known that gerbil densities need to exceed a threshold level for plague to persist, synchrony in gerbil abundance across large geographical areas is likely to be a condition for plague outbreaks at similar large scales. Here, we substantiate this proposition through autoregressive modelling involving the normalized differentiated vegetation index as a forcing covariate. Based upon predicted climate changes, our study suggests that during the next century, plague epizootics may become more frequent in central Asia.

TI Obligate symbiont involved in pest status of host insect
AB The origin of specific insect genotypes that enable efficient use of agricultural plants is an important subject not only in applied fields like pest control and management but also in basic disciplines like evolutionary biology. Conventionally, it has been presupposed that such pest-related ecological traits are attributed to genes encoded in the insect genomes. Here, however, we report that pest status of an insect is principally determined by symbiont genotype rather than by insect genotype. A pest stinkbug species, Megacopta punctatissima, performed well on crop legumes, while a closely related non-pest species, Megacopta cribraria, suffered low egg hatch rate on the plants. When their obligate gut symbiotic bacteria were experimentally exchanged between the species, their performance on the crop legumes was, strikingly, completely reversed: the pest species suffered low egg hatch rate, whereas the non-pest species restored normal egg hatch rate and showed good performance. The low egg hatch rates were attributed to nymphal mortality before or upon hatching, which were associated with the symbiont from the non-pest stinkbug irrespective of the host insect species. Our finding sheds new light on the evolutionary origin of insect pests, potentially leading to novel approaches to pest control and management.

TI Prevalence of avian influenza and host ecology
AB Waterfowl and shorebirds are common reservoirs of the low pathogenic subtypes of avian influenza (LPAI), which are easily transmitted to poultry and become highly pathogenic. As the risk of virus transmission depends on the prevalence of LPAI in host-reservoir systems, there is an urgent need for understanding how host ecology, life history and behaviour can affect virus prevalence in the wild. To test for the most important ecological correlates of LPAI virus prevalence at the interspecific level, we applied a comparative analysis by using quantitative data on 30 bird species. We controlled for similarity among species due to common descent, differences in study effort and for covariance among ecological variables. We found that LPAI prevalence is a species-specific attribute and is a consequence of virus susceptibility, as it was negatively associated with the relative size of the bursa of Fabricius, an estimate of juvenile immune function. Species that migrate long distances have elevated prevalence of LPAI independent of phylogeny and other confounding factors. There was also a positive interspecific relationship between the frequency of surface feeding and virus prevalence, but this was sensitive to phylogenetic relatedness of species. Feeding in marine habitats is apparently associated with lower virus prevalence, but the effect of water salinity is likely to be indirect and affected by phylogeny. Our results imply that virus transmission via surface waters and frequent intra- and interspecific contacts during long migration are the major risk factors of avian influenza in the wild. However, the link between exploitation of surface waters and LPAI prevalence appears to be weaker than previously thought. This is the first interspecific study that provides statistical evidence that host ecology, immunity and phylogeny have important consequence for virus prevalence.

TI Wood ants use resin to protect themselves against pathogens
AB Social life is generally associated with an increased exposure to pathogens and parasites, due to factors such as high population density, frequent physical contact and the use of perennial nest sites. However, sociality also permits the evolution of new collective behavioural defences. Wood ants, Formica paralugubris, commonly bring back pieces of solidified coniferous resin to their nest. Many birds and a few mammals also incorporate green plant material into their nests. Collecting plant material rich in volatile compounds might be an efficient way to fight bacteria and fungi. However, no study has demonstrated that this behaviour has a positive effect on survival. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence that animals using plant compounds with antibacterial and antifungal properties survive better when exposed to detrimental micro-organisms. The presence of resin strongly improves the survival of F. paralugubris adults and larvae exposed to the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, and the survival of larvae exposed to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. These results show that wood ants capitalize on the chemical defences which have evolved in plants to collectively protect themselves against pathogens.

TI The age and evolution of an antiviral resistance mutation in Drosophila
   melanogaster
AB What selective processes underlie the evolution of parasites and their hosts? Arms-race models propose that new host-resistance mutations or parasite counter-adaptations arise and sweep to fixation. Frequency-dependent models propose that selection favours pathogens adapted to the most common host genotypes, conferring an advantage to rare host genotypes. Distinguishing between these models is empirically difficult. The maintenance of disease-resistance polymorphisms has been studied in detail in plants, but less so in animals, and rarely in natural populations. We have made a detailed study of genetic variation in host resistance in a natural animal population, Drosophila melanogaster, and its natural pathogen, the sigma virus. We confirm previous findings that a single (albeit complex) mutation in the gene ref(2)P confers resistance against sigma and show that this mutation has increased in frequency under positive selection. Previous studies suggested that ref(2)P polymorphism reflects the progress of a very recent selective sweep, and that in Europe during the 1980s, this was followed by a sweep of a sigma virus strain able to infect flies carrying this mutation. We find that the ref(2)P resistance mutation is considerably older than the recent spread of this viral strain and suggest that-possibly because it is recessive-the initial spread of the resistance mutation was very slow.

TI Climate change-related health impacts in the Hindu Kush-Himalayas
AB Our goal was to identify the climate change-related health risks and vulnerable populations specific to the mountainous regions of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas. We reviewed published information of the likely health consequences of climate change in mountain regions, especially the findings of a workshop for countries in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region, organized by the World Health Organization, World Meteorological Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, and United Nations Development Programme. The main climate-related risks in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region include the expansion of vector-borne diseases as pathogens take advantage of new habitats in altitudes that were formerly unsuitable. Diarrheal diseases could become more prevalent with changes in freshwater quality and availability. More extreme rainfall events are likely to increase the number of floods and landslides with consequent death and injuries. A unique risk is sudden floods from high glacier lakes, which cause substantial destruction and loss of life. Because glaciers are the main source of freshwater for upland regions and downstream countries, the long-term reduction in annual glacier snowmelt is expected to heighten existing water insecurity in these areas. Climate change also is bringing some benefits to mountain populations, including milder winters and longer growing seasons. Populations in mountain regions have unique combinations of vulnerabilities to climate change. The extent of the health impacts experienced will depend on the effectiveness of public health efforts to identify and implement low-cost preparedness and response measures, and on the speed at which emissions of greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced.

TI Discovery of a novel alveolate pathogen affecting southern leopard frogs
   in Georgia: Description of the disease and host effects
AB In April of 2006, we observed southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) tadpoles in a pond in northeast Georgia that were dying from an unknown pathogen. Examination of affected specimens, as well as PCR characterization, revealed that all were infected with a novel alveolate pathogen closely related to freshwater and marine eukaryotic organisms and, to a lesser degree, to members of the genus Perkinsus. This pathogen has been documented in numerous mortality events in anuran tadpoles in the United States, although it has not yet been named nor clearly described. We subsequently conducted a systematic survey of this and four other ponds in the same area to document the extent of the pathogen and to describe the nature of infections in leopard frog tadpoles. Of 87 live tadpoles examined, 25% were infected with the alveolate pathogen, based on visual inspection of tadpole liver tissue. Affected tadpoles frequently had enlarged abdomens, swam erratically, and could be captured by hand. All organs of infected tadpoles were infiltrated but typically to a lesser extent than the liver and kidneys, which often had hundreds of thousands of the spherical, 6-mu m organisms. Infected tadpoles tended to weigh more than noninfected ones, likely due to the massive organ swelling that coincided with infections. Infected tadpoles did not differ in developmental stage from noninfected tadpoles. Infection prevalence varied widely among ponds, and in one pond, we witnessed a rapid die-off of R. spenocephala tadpoles during our surveys, although we did find infected metamorphic frogs. The rapid mortality we observed as well as the vast number of organisms seen in specimens suggests that this pathogen has tremendous transmission potential, and therefore deserves further monitoring and study.

TI Stochasticity generates an evolutionary instability for infectious
   disease
AB Traditional models of disease evolution are based upon the deterministic competition between strains that confer complete cross-immunity, and predict the selection of strains with higher basic reproductive ratios (R-0). In contrast, evolution in a stochastic setting is determined by a complex mixture of influences. Here, to isolate the impact of stochasticity, we constrain all competing strains to have an equal basic reproductive ratio - thereby eliminating deterministic selection. The resulting stochastic models predict an evolutionary unstable strategy, which separates a region favouring the evolution of rapid-transmission (acute) strains from one favouring persistent (chronic) strains. We find this to be a generic phenomenon with strain evolution consistently driven towards extremes of epidemiological behaviour. Even in the absence of an equal R-0 constraint, such stochastic selective pressures operate in addition to standard deterministic selection and will therefore influence the evolutionary behaviour of disease in an scenarios.

TI Simian foamy virus transmission from apes to humans, rural Cameroon
AB Simian virus infections of humans are an increasing public health concern. Simian foamy virus (SFV) infections have been reported in persons occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates and in a few hunters in Cameroon. To better understand this retroviral zoonosis in natural settings, we studied persons who lived in southern Cameroon, near nonhuman primate habitats. First we studied a general population of 1,164 adults; 4 were SFV positive according to serologic and molecular assays. Then we studied 85 persons who reported having been bitten or scratched by nonhuman primates; 7/29 (24.1 %) of those who had contact with apes (gorillas or chimpanzees) were SFV positive, compared with only 2/56 (3.6%) of those who had had contact with monkeys. These data demonstrate efficient transmission of SFVs to humans in natural settings in central Africa, specifically following ape bites, and viral persistence in the human host.

AB Viliuisk encephalomyelitis is an acute, often fatal, meningoencephalitis that tends to develop into a prolonged chronically progressive panencephalitis. Clinical, neuropathologic, and epidemiologic data argue for an infectious cause, although multiple attempts at pathogen isolation have been unsuccessful. To assess mechanisms of disease transmission and spread, we studied 6 multiplex families. Secondary cases occurred among genetically related and unrelated persons in a setting of prolonged intrahousehold contact with a patient manifesting the disease. Transmission to unrelated persons was documented in a densely populated region around the city of Yakutsk in which Viliuisk encephalomyelitis had not been previously known. Initially identified in a small Yakut-Evenk population on the Viliui River of eastern Siberia, the disease subsequently spread through human contacts to new geographic areas, thus characterizing Viliuisk encephalomyelitis as an emerging infectious disease.

TI Clinal variation in mhc diversity with temperature: Evidence for the
   role of host-pathogen interaction on local adaptation in Atlantic salmon
AB In vertebrates, variability at genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) represents an important adaptation for pathogen resistance, whereby high allelic diversity confers resistance to a greater number of pathogens. Pathogens can maintain diversifying selection pressure on their host's immune system that can vary in intensity based on pathogen richness, pathogen virulence, and length of the cohabitation period, which tend to increase with temperature. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that genetic diversity of MHC increases with temperature along a latitudinal gradient in response to pathogen selective pressure in the wild. A total of 1549 Atlantic salmon from 34 rivers were sampled between 46 degrees N and 58 degrees N in Eastern Canada. The results supported our working hypothesis. In contrast to the overall pattern observed at microsatellites, MHC class II allelic diversity increased with temperature, thus creating a latitudinal gradient. The observed temperature gradient was more pronounced for MHC amino acids of the peptide-binding region (PBR), a region that specifically binds to pathogens, than for the non-PBR. For the subset of rivers analyzed for bacterial diversity, MHC amino acid diversity of the PBR also increased significantly with bacterial diversity in each river. A comparison of the relative influence of temperature and bacterial diversity revealed that the latter could have a predominant role on MHC PBR variability. However, temperature was also identified as an important selective agent maintaining MHC diversity in the wild. Based on the bacteria results and given the putative role of temperature in shaping large-scale patterns of pathogen diversity and virulence, bacterial diversity is a plausible selection mechanism explaining the observed association between temperature and MHC variability. Therefore, we propose that genetic diversity at MHC class II represents local adaptation to cope with pathogen diversity in rivers associated with different thermal regimes. This study illuminates the link between selection pressure from the environment, host immune adaptation, and the large-scale genetic population structure for a nonmodel vertebrate in the wild.

   4. Transitions from healthy to diseased state increased with disease prevalence suggesting that the force of infection in the population is increasing and that the epidemic is not subsiding.
   5. The arrival of DFTD coincided with a marked, ongoing decline in the population growth rate of the previously stable population, which to date has not been offset by population compensatory responses.

TI Detecting local adaptation in a natural plant-pathogen metapopulation: a
   laboratory vs. field transplant approach
AB Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites in spatially structured populations can result in local adaptation of parasites. Traditionally parasite local adaptation has been investigated in field transplant experiments or in the laboratory under a constant environment. Despite the conceptual importance of local adaptation in studies of (co)evolution, to date no study has provided a comparative analysis of these two methods. Here, using information on pathogen population dynamics, I tested local adaptation of the specialist phytopathogen, Podosphaera plantaginis, to its host, Plantago lanceolata at three different spatial scales: sympatric host population, sympatric host metapopulation and allopatric host metapopulations. The experiment was carried out as a field transplant experiment with greenhouse-reared host plants from these three different origins introduced into four pathogen populations. In contrast to results of an earlier study performed with these same host and parasite populations under laboratory conditions, I did not find any evidence for parasite local adaptation. For interactions governed by strain-specific resistance, field studies may not be sensitive enough to detect mean parasite population virulence. Given that parasite transmission potential may be mediated by the abiotic environment and genotype-by-environment interactions, I suggest that relevant environmental variation should be incorporated into laboratory studies of parasite local adaptation.

TI Short-term rates of parasite evolution predict the evolution of host
   diversity
AB Coevolution with parasites has been implicated as an important factor driving the evolution of host diversity. Studies to date have focussed on gross effects of parasites: how host diversity differs in the presence vs. absence of parasites. But parasite-imposed selection is likely to show rapid variation through time. It is unclear whether short-term fluctuations in the strength of parasite-imposed selection tend to affect host diversity, because increases in host diversity are likely to be constrained by both the supply of genetic variation and ecological processes. We followed replicate populations of coevolving, initially isogenic, bacteria and phages through time, measuring host diversity (with respect to bacterial colony morphologies), host density and rates of parasite evolution. Both host density and time-lagged rates of parasite evolution were good independent predictors of the magnitude of bacterial within- and between-population diversities. Rapid parasite evolution and low host density decreased host within-population diversity, but increased between-population diversity. This study demonstrates that short-term changes in the rate of parasite evolution can predictably drive patterns of host diversity.

AB Molecular typing of the actinomycete Rhodococcus equi is insufficiently developed, and little is known about the epidemiology and transmission of this multihost pathogen. We report a simple, reliable polymerase chain reaction typing system for R. equi based on 3 plasmid gene markers: traA from the conserved conjugal transfer machinery and vapA and vapB, found in 2 different plasmid subpopulations. This "TRAVAP" typing scheme classifies R. equi into 4 categories: traA(+)/vapA(+)B(-), traA(+)/vapA(-)B(+), traA(+)/vapAB(-) , and traA(-)/vapAB(-) (plasmidless). A TRAVAP survey of 215 R. equi strains confirmed the strong link between vapA (traA(+)/vapA(+) B- plasmids) and horse isolates and revealed other host-related plasmid associations: between traA(+)/ vapA(-) B+ and pigs and between traA(+)/vapAB(-) -a new type of R. equi plasmid -and cattle. Plasmidless strains were more frequent among isolates from nonpathological specimens. All plasmid categories were common in human isolates, which possibly reflects the predominantly opportunistic nature of R. equi infection in this host and a zoonotic origin.

AB Parasites and infectious diseases are major determinants of population dynamics and adaptive processes, imposing fitness costs to their hosts and promoting genetic variation in natural populations. In the present study, we evaluate the role of individual genetic diversity on risk of parasitism by feather lice Degeeriella rufa in a wild lesser kestrel population (Falco naumanni). Genetic diversity at 11 microsatellite loci was associated with risk of parasitism by feather lice, with more heterozygous individuals being less likely to be parasitized, and this effect was statistically independent of other nongenetic parameters (colony size, sex, location, and year) which were also associated with lice prevalence. This relationship was nonlinear, with low and consistent prevalences among individuals showing high levels of genetic diversity that increased markedly at low levels of individual heterozygosity. This result appeared to reflect a genome-wide effect, with no single locus contributing disproportionably to the observed effect. Thus, overall genetic variation, rather than linkage of markers to genes experiencing single-locus heterosis, seems to be the underlying mechanism determining the association between risk of parasitism and individual genetic diversity in the study host-parasite system. However, feather lice burden was not affected by individual heterozygosity; what suggest that differences in susceptibility, rather than variation in defences once the parasite has been established, may shape the observed pattern. Overall, our results highlight the role of individual genetic diversity on risk of parasitism in wild populations, what has both important evolutionary implications and major consequences for conservation research on the light of emerging infectious diseases that may endanger genetically depauperated populations.

TI The recent spread of a vertically transmitted virus through populations
   of Drosophila melanogaster
AB The sigma virus is a vertically transmitted pathogen that commonly infects natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. This virus is the only known host-specific pathogen of D. melanogaster, and so offers a unique opportunity to study the genetics of Drosophila-viral interactions in a natural system. To elucidate the population genetic processes that operate in sigma virus populations, we collected D. melanogaster from 10 populations across three continents. We found that the sigma virus had a prevalence of 0-15% in these populations. Compared to other RNA viruses, we found that levels of viral genetic diversity are very low across Europe and North America. Based on laboratory measurements of the viral substitution rate, we estimate that most European and North American viral isolates shared a common ancestor approximately 200 years ago. We suggest two explanations for this: the first is that D. melanogaster has recently acquired the sigma virus; the second is that a single viral type has recently swept through D. melanogaster populations. Furthermore, in contrast to Drosophila populations, we find that the sigma viral populations are highly structured. This is surprising for a vertically transmitted pathogen that has a similar migration rate to its host. We suggest that the low structure in the viral populations can be explained by the smaller effective population size of the virus.

TI Temporal variation of Ixodes ricinus intensity on the rodent host
   Apodemus flavicollis in relation to local climate and host dynamics
AB The risk to humans of contracting tick-borne zoonotic diseases depends on the risk of a bite from an infected tick, which can be broken down into its component parts as the number of host-seeking ticks in the environment, in particular nymphs, and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens they are carrying. In turn, the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens is dependent upon tick biting intensity on hosts that support transmission between ticks; namely rodents. These ticks once fed moult into the next life stage and search for the next blood meal, thus posing a zoonotic risk. Here, we analyse tick biting intensity on rodents in a known tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) focus in Trentino (northern Italy). We examine patterns of tick demography and the influence of host densities and climate on ticks' generation time, development rates, tick density and intensity. During the period 2000-2004, a population of the yellow-necked mouse, Apodemus flavicollis, the most important TBE transmission host, was intensively monitored. Ticks feeding on individual rodents were counted, distinguishing between the larval and nymph life-stages. Local temperature and relative humidity was calculated using both data-loggers in the field site and regional weather stations. We investigated which factors had a predictive value both on feeding tick intensity and on the overall density of larvae or nymphs feeding on rodents in a year. We observed a negative effect of rodent density on tick intensity, while temperature influenced positively both larvae and nymph intensity. Overall larval density was higher in the years and trapping grids where rodent density was higher, while for nymphs no such effect was observed. The best explanatory variable for nymph density was the larval density in the previous year, confirming the discrete nature of tick demography. This provides important information in terms of monitoring the risk to humans of acquiring pathogen-infected ticks.

TI Dynamics of oliveros virus infection in rodents in central Argentina
AB Oliveros virus (OLV) is an arenavirus hosted by the sigmodontine rodent, Necromys benefactus, in central Argentina. We report a 3-year longitudinal field study of the dynamics of OLV infection in host populations from 15 localities in two provinces on the central Argentine pampa. There was an overall 3-year period immunofluorescent antibody prevalence of 25% in the host population, and infected hosts were found throughout the study area. Spill-over infection into common sympatric species was rare. Infection dynamics exhibited many of the patterns seen for other rodent-borne arenaviruses and hantaviruses, but had some unique characteristics. Host population density was highest in autumn and lowest in spring, while antibody prevalence was highest in spring and lowest in autumn. Virus transmission was horizontal: infection was strongly associated with age, reaching 45% prevalence in the oldest individuals, and prevalence of infection was equal among male and female hosts. Infection may have been associated with scars, which were also approximately equally distributed among male and female Necromys.

TI Inter-annual associations between precipitation and human incidence of
   West Nile virus in the United States
AB Higher-than-average precipitation levels may cause mosquito outbreaks if mosquitoes are limited by larval habitat availability. Alternatively, recent ecological research suggests that drought events can lead to mosquito outbreaks the following year due to changes in food web structure. By either mechanism, these mosquito outbreaks may contribute to human cases of West Nile Virus (WNV) in the recent United States outbreak. Using county-level precipitation and human WNV incidence data (2002-2004), we tested the impacts of above and below-average rainfall on the prevalence of WNV in human populations both within and between years. We found evidence that human WNV incidence is most strongly associated with annual precipitation from the preceding year. Human outbreaks of WNV are preceded by above-average rainfall in the eastern United States and below-average rainfall in the western United States in the prior year. While no direct mechanism may be determined from this study, we hypothesize that differences in the ecology of mosquito vectors may be responsible for the opposite relationships between precipitation and WNV outbreaks between the eastern and western United States.

TI Delayed density-dependent prevalence of Sin Nombre virus antibody in
   Montana deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and implications for human
   disease risk
AB American hantaviruses cause a severe respiratory disease known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). In the United States, Sin Nombre virus (SNV), carried by the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), is the etiologic agent in the majority of HPS cases. The relationship between deer mouse population density and SNV infection prevalence in deer mice is poorly understood. Our purpose was to clarify this relationship by demonstrating the existence of delayed-density-dependent prevalence of SNV infection in populations of wild deer mice. We also explored the relationship between SNV infection in deer mouse populations and the incidence of human HPS. The study population was 3,616 deer mice captured on 10 mark-recapture grids in Montana during May and September, 1994-2004. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found a strong association between deer mouse population density in fall (September) and SNV antibody prevalence in deer mice the following spring (May). Other characteristics associated with SNV infection in deer mice in spring were: (1) presence of at least one infected deer mouse in the population the previous fall, (2) male gender, (3) adult age class, (4) presence of scars, (5) grassland and logged habitats, and (6) elevations below 1,300 m. There was a strong association between concurrently measured SNV antibody prevalence in deer mice and probable exposure of human HPS cases during the same time period. Human cases were more likely to occur during seasons when SNV antibody prevalence was at least 10% in deer mouse populations. These findings suggest that fall rodent population parameters could be used to help guide prevention efforts the following spring.

TI Phylogenetic comparison of rabies viruses from disease outbreaks on the
   Svalbard Islands
AB Periodic wildlife rabies epizootics occur in Arctic regions. The original sources of these outbreaks are rarely identified. In 1980, a wildlife epizootic of rabies occurred on the previously rabies-free Svalbard Islands, Norway. After this outbreak of rabies in the arctic fox population (Alopex lagopus), only single cases have been reported from the Islands over the following two decades. Phylogenetic characterization of four viruses isolated from infected arctic foxes from Svalbard from three different time periods suggest that the source of these epizootics could have been migration of this species from the Russian mainland. Arctic fox migration has likely contributed to the establishment of another zoonotic disease, Echinococcus multilocularis, on Svalbard in recent years.

TI Molecular epidemiology identifies only a single rabies virus variant
   circulating in complex carnivore communities of the Serengeti
AB Understanding the transmission dynamics of generalist pathogens that infect multiple host species is essential for their effective control. Only by identifying those host populations that are critical to the permanent maintenance of the pathogen, as opposed to populations in which outbreaks are the result of 'spillover' infections, can control measures be appropriately directed. Rabies virus is capable of infecting a wide range of host species, but in many ecosystems, particular variants circulate among only a limited range of potential host populations. The Serengeti ecosystem (in northwestern Tanzania) supports a complex community of wild carnivores that are threatened by generalist pathogens that also circulate in domestic dog populations surrounding the park boundaries. While the combined assemblage of host species appears capable of permanently maintaining rabies in the ecosystem, little is known about the patterns of circulation within and between these host populations. Here we use molecular phylogenetics to test whether distinct virus-host associations occur in this species-rich carnivore community. Our analysis identifies a single major variant belonging to the group of southern Africa canid-associated viruses (Africa 1b) to be circulating within this ecosystem, and no evidence for species-specific grouping. A statistical parsimony analysis of nucleoprotein and glycoprotein gene sequence data is consistent with both within- and between-species transmission events. While likely differential sampling effort between host species precludes a definitive inference, the results are most consistent with dogs comprising the reservoir of rabies and emphasize the importance of applying control efforts in dog populations.
