TI High Wolbachia density in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes
AB Wolbachia symbionts are responsible for various alterations in host reproduction. The effects of the host genome on endosymbiont levels have often been suggested, but rarely described. Here, we show that Wolbachia density is strongly modified by the presence of insecticide-resistant genes in the common house mosquito, Culex pipiens. The Wolbachia density was estimated using a real-time quantitative PCR assay. Strains harbouring different genes conferring resistance were more infected than a susceptible strain with the same genetic background. We show that this interaction also operates in natural populations. We propose that mosquitoes may control Wolbachia density less efficiently when they carry an insecticide-resistant gene, i.e. when they suffer from a physiological resistance cost.

TI The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine in the
   genital tracts of men infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1
   (AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 850)
AB The AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 850 (ACTG 850) evaluated the penetration of zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and amprenavir (APV), given alone and in combination with the 2 nucleoside analogues, into the male genital tract, because these factors may affect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 suppression and transmission. Nineteen men receiving APV monotherapy and 12 men receiving triple therapy donated blood plasma (BP) and seminal plasma (SP) during therapy. Paired SP and BP were used to calculate compartmental concentration ratios. APV SP concentrations were consistently lower than BP concentrations, ZDV SP concentrations approximated BP concentrations early but became greater later in the dosing interval, and 3TC SP concentrations were substantially greater than BP concentrations throughout. Observed SP concentrations plotted with population BP concentration- time curves confirmed these findings, suggesting that passive diffusion (APV), slowed elimination (ZDV), and either active accumulation and/or inhibition of elimination (3TC) are responsible for SP concentrations of these agents. The antiretroviral effect of APV monotherapy was related to APV concentrations.

TI Dynamics of a mutualism in a multi-species context
AB Despite recent findings that mutualistic interactions between two species may be greatly affected by species external to the mutualism the implications of such multi-species interactions for the population dynamics of the mutualists are virtually unexplored. In this paper, we ask how the mutualism between the shoot-base boring weevil Apion onopordi and the rust fungus Puccinia punctiformis is influenced by the dynamics of their shared host plant Cirsium arvense, and vice versa. In particular, we hypothesized that the distribution of the weevil's egg load between healthy and rust-infected thistles may regulate the abundance of the mutualists and their host plant. In contrast to our expectations we found that the dynamics of the mutualists are largely determined by the dynamics of their host. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that the dynamics of a mutualism are driven by a third, non-mutualistic species.

TI Passive antibody administration (immediate immunity) as a specific
   defense against biological weapons
AB The potential threat of biological warfare with a specific agent is proportional to the susceptibility of the population to that agent. Preventing disease after exposure to a biological agent is partially a function of the immunity of the exposed individual. The only available countermeasure that can provide immediate immunity against a biological agent is passive antibody. Unlike vaccines, which require time to induce protective immunity and depend on the host's ability to mount an immune response, passive antibody can theoretically confer protection regardless of the immune status of the host. Passive antibody therapy has substantial advantages over antimicrobial agents and other measures for postexposure prophylaxis, including low toxicity and high specific activity. Specific antibodies are active against the major agents of bioterrorism, including anthrax, smallpox, botulinum toxin, tularemia, and plague. This article proposes a biological defense initiative based on developing, producing, and stockpiling specific antibody reagents that can be used to protect the population against biological warfare threats.

TI An outbreak of hepatitis A among homosexuals linked to a family outbreak
AB Several outbreaks of hepatitis A occurred in Norway in 1995-8. Molecular epidemiology was used to follow the spread of hepatitis A virus in the population. Distinct strains of hepatitis A virus (HAV) were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and subsequent sequencing in serum from patients in different communities at risk of infection. Two HAV strains were detected in an outbreak among 26 men having sexual contact with other men. One of these strains was also detected in a geographically limited family outbreak. The family outbreak was first believed to be acquired abroad. The sequence information linked the two outbreaks, and epidemiological and serological analyses revealed the transmission route. This study demonstrates the importance of molecular epidemiology in outbreak investigation, surveillance and monitoring of hepatitis A in the population.

TI A clarification of transmission terms in host-microparasite models:
   numbers, densities and areas
AB Transmission is the driving force in the dynamics of any infectious disease. A crucial element in understanding disease dynamics, therefore, is the 'transmission term' describing the rate at which susceptible hosts are 'converted' into infected hosts by their contact with infectious material. Recently, the conventional form of this term has been increasingly questioned, and new terminologies and conventions have been proposed. Here, therefore, we review the derivation of transmission terms, explain the basis of confusion, and provide clarification. The root of the problem has been a failure to include explicit consideration of the area occupied by a host population, alongside both the number of infectious hosts and their density within the population. We argue that the terms 'density-dependent transmission' and 'frequency-dependent transmission' remain valid and useful (though a 'fuller' transmission term for the former is identified), but that the terms 'mass action', 'true mass action' and 'pseudo mass action' are all unhelpful and should be dropped. Also, contrary to what has often been assumed, the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing in a host population is orthogonal to the distinction between density- and frequency-dependent transmission modes.

TI Transmission of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in pigs is characterized
   by variation in infectivity
AB Ten transmission trials with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae were carried out. The observed transmission was highly variable, which was surprising since the design of the trials was very similar. We investigated whether the variable transmission could be explained by variation in infectivity of A. pleuropneumoniae infected pigs. We looked for measurable characteristics, which could be indicative for infectious pigs or for the level of infectivity. The characteristic that appeared to be most indicative for a pig being infectious was an A. pleuropneumoniae positive tonsil at necropsy. The characteristic that was correlated to the level of infectivity was the number of A. pleuropneumoniae colonies isolated from the nasal swab, i.e. the probability for an infectious pig to infect a susceptible pig was tenfold higher on days where at least ten colonies were isolated. In this study it is shown that it is possible to measure the bacterial transmission of A. pleuropneumoniae under controlled circumstances if variation in infectivity is taken into account.

TI The inhibitory effect of C-reactive protein on bacterial
   phosphorylcholine platelet-activating factor receptor-mediated adherence
   is blocked by surfactant
AB Numerous major bacterial pathogens in the human respiratory tract, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, express cell-surface phosphorylcholine (ChoP), a ligand for the receptor for platelet-activating factor (rPAF). ChoP is also bound by C-reactive protein (CRP), which, in the presence of complement, may be bactericidal. This study found that CRP can block the attachment of bacteria expressing cell-surface ChoP to host cells. Concentrations of CRP equivalent to those on the mucosal surface of the human airway blocked most adherence of both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to human pharyngeal epithelial cells. ChoP-mediated adherence was also reduced in the presence of an rPAFantagonist. The antiadhesive effects of the rPAF antagonist and CRP were not additive, suggesting that CRP activity is specific to the area of adherence mediated by the receptor. The binding of CRP to ChoP and the effect of CRP on adherence were inhibited by human surfactant (primarily ChoP). The antiadhesive effect of CRP may be diminished in the terminal airway, where surfactant is abundant.

TI Analysing noisy time-series: describing regional variation in the cyclic
   dynamics of red grouse
AB We develop a method for describing the periodicity of noisy 'quasi-cyclic' time-series based on integrals of their power spectra corresponding to different frequency intervals that we use to classify time-series as 'strongly cyclic', 'weakly cyclic' or 'non-cyclic', We apply this analysis to over 300 time-series of shooting records of red grouse from 289 moors located in 20 regions of the UK. Time-series from 63 of these populations were not distinguishable from white noise, but significant evidence of cyclic behaviour in the 2-15 year range was detected in time-series from 183 other populations. Time-series from the remaining 43 populations, though distinguishable from white noise, did not exhibit consistently recognizable cyclic behaviour in the same period range. Cyclic populations exhibit an average periodicity of 8.3 years, but only 20% of these populations cycle with a period of four to six years. Geographically, grouse populations are remarkable more for their dynamic heterogeneity than for any observable regularity. The relationship between the location of populations and their dynamical behaviour is weak. The prevalence of cyclic time-series within a region did not significantly differ from the overall average value. Moor region explained 22% of the variation in periodicity, differing from the overall mean in three regions. Average periodicity increases significantly from 6,8 to 8.9 years from the most southerly to most northerly populations. However, latitude explains only 5.3% of the variation in periodicity of the cycles.

TI The role of parasites in the dynamics of a reindeer population
AB Even though theoretical models show that parasites may regulate host population densities, few empirical studies have given support to this hypothesis. We present experimental and observational evidence for a host-parasite interaction where the parasite has sufficient impact on host population dynamics for regulation to occur. During a six year study of the Svalbard reindeer and its parasitic gastrointestinal nematode Ostertagia gruehneri we found that anthelminthic treatment in April-May increased the probability of a reindeer having a calf in the next year, compared with untreated controls. However, treatment did not influence the over-winter survival of the reindeer. The annual variation in the degree to which parasites depressed fecundity was positively related to the abundance of O. gruehneri infection the previous October, which in turn was related to host density two years earlier. In addition to the treatment effect, there was a strong negative effect of winter precipitation on the probability of female reindeer having a calf. A simple matrix model was parameterized using estimates from our experimental and observational data. This model shows that the parasite-mediated effect on fecundity was sufficient to regulate reindeer densities around observed host densities.

TI Infection dynamics of Sin Nombre virus after a widespread decline in
   host populations
AB Many researchers have speculated that infection dynamics of Sin Nombre virus are driven by density patterns of its major host, Peromyscus maniculatus. Few, if any. studies have examined this question systematically at 11 realistically large spatial scale. however. We collected data from 1,59 independent field sites within a 1 million-hectare study area in Nevada and California, from 1995-1998. In 1997. there was a widespread and substantial reduction in host density. This reduction in host density did not reduce seroprevalence of antibody to Sin Nombre virus within host populations. During this period. however. there was a significant reduction in the likelihood that antibody-positive mice had detectable virus in their blood, as determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Our findings suggest 2 possible causal mechanisms for this reduction: an apparent change in the age structure of host populations and landscape-scale patterns of host density. This study indicates that a relationship does exist between host density and infection dynamics and that this relationship concurrently operates at different spatial scales. It also highlights the limitations of antibody seroprevalence as a metric of infections. especially during, transient host-density fluctuations.

TI Contrasting sylvatic foci of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in

AB The ecology of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus transmission was compared at three enzootic foci: two forest sites in the Catatumbo region of western Venezuela that have yielded small numbers of virus isolates since the 1970s, and another focus in the middle Magdalena Valley of Colombia that has consistently yielded many VEE virus isolates. Our results demonstrated dramatic differences in VEE virus isolation rates from sentinel hamsters, as well as differences in mosquito species composition and captured mammals with antibodies to VEE virus. between the Colombian and Venezuelan study sites. The higher isolation rate of enzootic VEE virus in the Colombian site was associated with a more abundant fauna of spiny rats (Proechimys spp,), known reservoir hosts of enzootic VEE virus, Mosquito collections demonstrated that the Colombian forest had a higher mosquito diversify and species evenness than either of the Venezuelan forests. The Colombian focus was especially richer in its Culex (Melanoconion) spp, fauna. a subgenus that includes all proven enzootic vectors for VEE virus. Our results suggest that the greater abundance. diversity, and stability of enzootic vector populations combined with the greater density (if rodent reservoir hosts, explains the higher levels of VEE virus circulation in the Colombian focus compared with the Venezuelan forests.

TI Stage-structured infection transmission and a spatial epidemic: A model
   for Lyme disease
AB A greater understanding of the rate at which emerging disease advances spatially has both ecological and applied significance. Analyzing the spread of vector-borne disease can be relatively complex when the vector's acquisition of a pathogen and subsequent transmission to a host occur in different life stages. A contemporary example is Lyme disease. A long-lived tick vector acquires infection during the larval blood meal and transmits it as a nymph. We present a reaction-diffusion model for the ecological dynamics governing the velocity of the current epidemic's spread. We find that the equilibrium density of infectious tick nymphs (hence the risk of human disease) can depend on density-independent survival interacting with biotic effects on the tick's stage structure. The local risk of infection reaches a maximum at an intermediate level of adult tick mortality and at an intermediate rate of juvenile tick attacks on mammalian hosts. If the juvenile tick attack rate is low, an increase generates both a greater density of infectious nymphs and an increased spatial velocity. However, if the juvenile attack rate is relatively high, nymph density may decline while the epidemic's velocity still increases. Velocities of simulated two-dimensional epidemics correlate with the model pathogen's basic reproductive number (R-0), but calculating R-0 involves parameters of both host infection dynamics and the vector's stage-structured dynamics.

TI Which way to manipulate host reproduction? Wolbachia that cause
   cytoplasmic incompatibility are easily invaded by sex ratio-distorting
   mutants
AB The bacterium Wolbachia manipulates its hosts by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), where zygotes formed from crosses between uninfected mothers and infected fathers die. In addition, it distorts the host's sex ratio via male killing, parthenogenesis induction, or feminization. Here, we model transitions between these states, examining the evolution of mutants of CI strains that retain both the ability to induce and resist CI but, in addition, cause sex ratio distortion. The model shows that CI strains are highly susceptible to invasion and subsequent elimination by these mutants. For all three types of sex ratio distortion, there is some parameter space in which the strain showing sex ratio distortion becomes extinct following exclusion of the progenitor CI strain, leaving the population uninfected. Extinction of the new Wolbachia strain is common for the case of male killing but rarer for parthenogenesis induction and feminization. Our models predict that CI strains of Wolbachia will occur most commonly in hosts that are male heterogametic, where there is little interaction between siblings because these hosts are unlikely to favor the spread of male killing, feminization, or parthenogenesis induction. The models raise the question of why CI strains apparently predominate in nature, and it is suggested that this is a result of either fewer restrictions on CI strains spreading through novel host populations or restrictions to the mutability of Wolbachia strains.

TI Disease transmission of aspergillosis in sea fans: Inferring process
   from spatial pattern
AB Despite recent high impacts of disease in the ocean, quantitative studies of diseases in natural marine populations lag far behind terrestrial systems. Transmission processes are poorly known in relatively open marine systems. We studied infection of sea fans Gorgonia ventalina by the fungus Aspergillus sydowii. To assess detectability and mechanisms of secondary transmission of the fungus, we analyzed the spatial distribution of disease among the fans, using Ripley's K as a measure of disease aggregation. Coral populations and disease were mapped at three reefs in the Florida Keys. Where disease prevalence was low, the disease was distributed randomly among sea fans. This is consistent with disease transmission by input of infectious fungal material from terrestrial sources only. However, where disease prevalence was high, the disease was significantly. aggregated among sea fans at the 2-8 in scale, consistent with secondary disease transmission. Such transmission could take place by physical contact between neighboring fans, or infected fans might shed fungal material into the water column, and other fans become infected by these fomites. Our results suggest that water-borne transmission occurs, but secondary transmission by physical contact is also likely. We cannot falsify the hypothesis that small-scale local environmental conditions also contribute to disease aggregation.

TI A new name (Pneumocystis jiroveci) for Pneumocystis from humans
AB The disease known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is a major cause of illness and death in persons with impaired immune systems. While the genus Pneumocystis has been known to science for nearly a century, understanding of its members remained rudimentary until DNA analysis showed its extensive diversity. Pneumocystis organisms from different host species have very different DNA sequences, indicating multiple species. In recognition of its genetic and functional distinctness, the organism that causes human PCP is now named Pneumocystis jiroveci Frenkel 1999. Changing the organism's name does not preclude the use of the acronym PCP because it can be read "Pneumocystis pneumonia." DNA sequence variation exists among samples of R jiroveci, a feature that allows reexamination of the relationships between host and pathogen. Instead of lifelong latency, transient colonization may be the rule.

TI Demographic factors associated with hantavirus infection in bank voles
   (Clethrionomys glareolus)
AB The bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) is the natural reservoir of Puumala virus (PUUV), a species in the genus Hantavirus. PUUV is the etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Factors that influence hantavirus transmission within host populations are not well understood. We evaluated a number of factors influencing on the association of increased PUUV infection in bank voles captured in a region in northern Sweden endemic for the virus. Logistic regression showed four factors that together correctly predicted 80% of the model outcome: age, body mass index, population phase during sampling (increase, peak, or decline/low), and gender. This analysis highlights the importance of population demography in the successful circulation of hantavirus. The chance of infection was greatest during the peak of the population cycle, implying that the likelihood of exposure to hantavirus increases with increasing population density.

TI Evolution of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility in Drosophila
   simulans and D-sechellia
AB The intracellular bacterium Wolbachia invades arthropod host populations through various mechanisms, the most common of which being cytoplasmic incompatibility (Q. Cl involves elevated embryo mortality when infected males mate with uninfected females or females infected with different, incompatible Wolbachia strains. The present study focuses on this phenomenon in two Drosophila species: D. simulans and D. sechellia. Drosophila simulans populations are infected by several Wolbachia strains, including wHa and wNo. Drosophila sechellia is infected by only two Wolbachia: wSh and wSn. In both Drosophila species, double infections with Wolbachia are found. As indicated by several molecular markers, wHa is closely related to wSh, and wNo to wSn. Furthermore, the double infections in the two host species are associated with closely related mitochondrial haplotypes, namely siI (associated with wHa and wNo in D. simulans) and se (associated with wSh and wSn in D. sechellia). To test the theoretical prediction that Wolbachia compatibility types can diverge rapidly, we injected wSh and wSn into D. simulans, to compare their CI properties to those of their sister strains wHa and wNo, respectively, in the same host genetic background. We found that within each pair of sister strains Cl levels were similar and that sister strains were fully compatible. We conclude that the short period for which the Wolbachia sister strains have been evolving separated from each other was not sufficient for their Cl properties to diverge significantly.

TI Parasite transmission: reconciling theory and reality
AB 1. Arguably the most important and elusive component of host-parasite models is the transmission function. Considerable empirical and theoretical work has focused on determining the correct formulation of this function although, to date, there has been little attempt to combine these studies to develop general insights into how observed transmission rates affect host-parasite dynamics.
   2. Here, estimates of transmission rates from a range of host-parasite systems in the literature are described using a phenomenological function which takes into account how transmission varies with host and parasite densities. This function is placed in the appropriate model framework to determine the consequences of the observed transmission rates for each system.
   3. All of the parasites had decreasing per capita transmission rates with increasing parasite densities suggesting that parasites tend to saturate at high densities, either as hosts become limiting or due to heterogeneities amongst the host population. In terms of the responses to host density, the parasites fell into two groups: those with increasing or decreasing transmission rates. This dichotomy was due to the biology of the organisms; the former group infect through cannibalism, which increased at high densities as the individuals became stressed, whereas the latter group infected through free-living stages, resulting in a form of spatial structuring reducing the number of hosts available for infection.
   4. A metapopulation model was developed where hosts and parasites interacted in discrete patches according to the appropriate transmission function, with neighbouring patches linked by dispersal. The model suggested that small-scale, localized transmission events can drive large-scale epizootics at the metapopulation level. This emphasizes the importance of correctly describing and quantifying the transmission function at the individual level.
   5. Traditionally, the formulation of the transmission function has depended on the scale of observation. This work shows that transmission should be considered from the viewpoint of the organisms concerned. Observed transmission rates are a consequence of the biology of the individuals meaning it should be possible to develop a priori hypotheses concerning the nature of the transmission function from a basic understanding of the life history of the organisms concerned.

TI Competitiveness and life-history characteristics of Daphnia with respect
   to susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen
AB Costs of resistance, i.e. trade-offs between resistance to parasites or pathogens and other fitness components, may prevent the fixation of resistant genotypes and therefore explain the maintenance of genetic polymorphism for resistance in the wild. Using two approaches, the cost of resistance to a sterilizing bacterial pathogen were tested for in the crustacean Daphnia magna. First, groups of susceptible and resistant hosts from each of four natural populations were compared in terms of their life-history characteristics. Secondly, we examined the competitiveness of nine clones from one population for which more detailed information on genetic variation for resistance was known. In no case did the results show that competitiveness or life history characteristics of resistant Daphnia systematically differed from susceptible ones. These results suggest that costs of resistance are unlikely to explain the maintenance of genetic variation in D. magna populations. We discuss methods for measuring fitness and speculate on which genetic models of host-parasite co-evolution may apply to the Daphnia-microparasite system.

TI Contrasting effects of Wolbachia on cytoplasmic incompatibility and
   fecundity in the haplodiploid mite Tetranychus urticae
AB Recent studies on Wolbachia-induced incompatibility in haplodiploid insects and mites have revealed a diversity of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) patterns among host species. Here, we report intraspecific diversity in CI expression among four strains of the arrhenotokous mite Tetranychus urticae and in T. turkestani. Variability of CI expression within T. urticae ranged from no CI to complete CI, and included either female embryonic mortality or male conversion types of CI. A fecundity cost attributed to the infection with the high-CI Wolbachia strain was the highest ever recorded for Wolbachia (-80 to -100% decrease). Sequence polymorphism at a 550-bp-portion of Wolbachia wsp gene revealed two clusters distant by 21%, one of which included three Wolbachia strains infecting mite populations sampled from the same host-plant species, but showing distinct CI patterns. These data are discussed in the light of theoretical predictions on the evolutionary pathways followed in this symbiotic interaction.

TI Within- and among-population variation in infectivity, latency and spore
   production in a host-pathogen system
AB In spatially structured populations, host-parasite coevolutionary potential depends on the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations. Inoculation experiments using the plant, Silene latifolia, and its fungal pathogen, Microbotryum violaceum, revealed little overall differentiation in infectivity/resistance, latency or spore production among host or pathogen populations. Within populations, fungal strains had similar means, but varied in performance across plant populations. Variation in resistance among seed families indicates the potential for parasite-mediated selection, whereas there was little evidence for local pathogen genotype x plant genotype interactions assumed by most theoretical coevolution models. Lower spore production on sympatric than allopatric hosts confirmed local fungal maladaptation already observed for infectivity. Correlations between infectivity and latency or spore production suggest a common mechanism for variation in these traits. Our results suggest low variation available to this pathogen for tracking its coevolving host. This may be caused by random drift, breeding system or migration characteristic of metapopulation dynamics.

TI Association between immune recovery uveitis and a diverse intraocular
   cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T cell response
AB Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes serious infection in individuals with deficient T cell immunity. In acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the retina is a major site of progressive infection, despite the availability of therapy that targets CMV. The administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy to suppress human immunodeficiency virus frequently results in resolution of CMV retinitis, but this may be complicated by ocular inflammation termed "immune recovery uveitis" (IRU). To provide insight into the pathogenesis of IRU, the phenotype and specificity of intraocular T cells in a single patient were analyzed. The T cell infiltrate consisted of a diverse population of CD8(+) CMV-specific T cells, but only a minority of these T cells recognized the CMV phosphoprotein 65 and immediate early protein 1, which have been considered major targets of the host response. These results imply that reconstitution of CMV-specific T cells plays a role in IRU and suggest that the specificity of T cells engaged in the control of CMV at local sites of reactivation may be broad.

TI West Nile virus
AB West Nile (WN) virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and human, equine, and avian neuropathogen. The virus is indigenous to Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia, and has recently caused large epidemics in Romania, Russia, and Israel. Birds are the natural reservoir (amplifying) hosts, and WN virus is maintained in nature in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle primarily involving Culex sp mosquitoes. WN virus was recently introduced to North America, where it was first detected in 1999 during an epidemic of meningoencephalitis in New York City. During 1999-2002, the virus extended its range throughout much of the eastern parts of the USA, and its range within the western hemisphere is expected to continue to expand. During 1999-2001, 142 cases of neuroinvasive WN viral disease of the central nervous system (including 18 fatalities), and seven cases of uncomplicated WN fever were reported in the USA. Most human WN viral infections are subclinical but clinical infections can range in severity from uncomplicated WN fever to fatal meningoencephalitis; the incidence of severe neuroinvasive disease and death increase with age. Serology remains the mainstay of laboratory diagnosis. No WN virus-specific treatment or vaccine is available. Prevention depends on organised, sustained vector mosquito control, and public education.

TI The incidence and diversity of Wolbachia in gallwasps (Hymenoptera;
   Cynipidae) on oak
AB Wolbachia bacteria infect approximate to 20% of all insect species, and cause a range of alterations to host reproduction, including imposition of thelytoky. The incidence and phenotypic impact of Wolbachia remains to be established in many insect taxa, and considerable research effort is currently focused on its association with particular reproductive modes and the relative importance of the various pathways via which infection occurs. Gallwasps represent an attractive system for addressing these issues for two reasons. First, they show a diversity of reproductive modes (including arrhenotoky, thelytoky and cyclical parthenogenesis) in which the impact of Wolbachia infection can be examined. Second, they occupy two intimately linked trophic niches (gall-inducers and inquilines) between which there is potential for the horizontal exchange of Wolbachia infection. In the arrhenotokous gallwasp lineages screened to date (the herb-galling 'Aylacini' and the rose-galling Diplolepidini), Wolbachia infection always induces thelytoky. The impact of Wolbachia in other arrhenotokous clades, and in the cyclically parthenogenetic clades remains unknown. Here we use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening and sequence data for two Wolbachia genes (wsp and ftsZ ) to examine the prevalence and incidence of Wolbachia infection in 64 species (a total of 609 individuals) in two further tribes: the arrhenotokous inquilines (tribe Synergini), and the cyclically parthenogenetic oak gallwasps (tribe Cynipini). We ask: (i) whether Wolbachia infection has any apparent impact on host reproduction in the two tribes and (ii) whether there is any correlation between Wolbachia infection and the apparent lack of an arrhenotokous generation in many oak gallwasp life cycles. We show: (i) that Wolbachia infection is rare in the Cynipini. Infected species show no deviation from cyclical parthenogenesis, and infection is no more common in species known only from a thelytokous generation; (ii) that there is a higher incidence of infection within the arrhenotokous inquilines, and generally in gallwasp tribes without cyclical parthenogensis; (iii) all Wolbachia -positive inquiline species are known to possess males, implying either that Wolbachia infection does not result in loss of sex in this tribe or, more probably, that (as for some rose gallwasps) Wolbachia infection leads to loss of sex in specific populations; and (iv) although we find some inquilines and gall inducers to be infected with Wolbachia having the same wsp sequence, these hosts are not members of the same gall communities, arguing against frequent horizontal transmission between these two trophic groups. We suggest that exchange may be mediated by the generalist parasitoids common in oak galls.

TI Spatial Analysis of West Nile Virus: Rapid Risk Assessment of an
   Introduced Vector-Borne Zoonosis
AB The distribution of human risk for West Nile virus was determined by spatial analysis of the initial case distribution for the New York City area in 1999 using remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. Cluster analysis revealed the presence of a statistically significant grouping of cases, which also indicates the area of probable virus introduction. Within the cluster, habitat suitability for potentially infective adult mosquitoes was measured by the amount of vegetation cover using satellite imagery. Logistic regression analysis revealed satellite-derived vegetation abundance to be significantly and positively associated with the presence of human cases. The logistic model was used to estimate the spatial distribution of human risk for West Nile virus throughout New York City. Accuracy of the resulting risk map was cross-validated using virus-positive mosquito sample sites. These new epidemiological methods aid in rapid entry point identification and spatial prediction of human risk of infection for introduced vector-borne pathogens.

TI Trade-offs in group living: transmission and disease resistance in
   leaf-cutting ants
AB Sociality can be associated with significant costs due to the increased risk of disease transmission. However, in some organisms the costs may be offset by benefits due to improvements in defences against parasites. To examine this possible trade-off between infection risk and disease resistance, we used Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants and the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae as the model system. Ants exposed to the parasite were found to have substantially improved survival when they were kept with nest-mates, while the cost of being in a group in terms of increased disease transmission was very low. The efficiency of transmission is described by the transmission parameter, which decreased with increasing host density showing that transmission rates are inversely density dependent. Both grooming and antibiotic secretions appeared to be important in resistance against the parasite, with the defences of small workers being particularly effective. The results indicate that leaf-cutting ant colonies may have much greater resistance to disease than would be predicted from the high densities of host individuals within them. Unlike most organisms, group living in these ants may actually be associated with a net benefit in terms of disease dynamics.

TI The ecology and genetics of a host shift: Microbotryum as a model system
AB The need to prevent and cure emerging diseases often precludes their continuing study in situ. We present studies on the process of disease emergence by host shifts using the model system of anther-smut disease (Microbotryum violaceum) on the plant genus Silene (Caryophyllaceae). This system has little direct social impact, and it is readily amenable to experimental manipulation. Our microevolutionary studies have focused on the host shift of Microbotryum from Silene alba (= latifolia; white campion) onto Silene vulgaris (bladder campion) in a population in Virginia. Karyotypic variation shows that the host shift is recent and originates from the disease on sympatric S. alba. Analysis of the spatial pattern of disease shows that the host shift has been contingent on the co-occurrence of the two species at a local scale. Cross-inoculation studies show that families of the new host differ greatly in their susceptibility to the pathogen, indicating the potential for rapid evolution of resistance. Disease expression on the new host is frequently abnormal, suggesting that the pathogen is imperfectly adapted to its new host. In experimental populations, disease transmission within populations of the old host is greater than within populations of the new host. However, there is also a high transmission rate of the disease from the new host back to the old host, suggesting a feedback effect that increases disease prevalence in the community as a whole. Continuing studies of these populations are designed to determine whether this new host-pathogen system is likely to be self-sustaining and to quantify evolutionary changes in both the host and the pathogen.

TI Ecology and evolution of host-parasite associations: Mycophagous
   Drosophila and their parasitic nematodes
AB Associations between mycophagous Drosophila and nematode parasites occur throughout the temperate and boreal regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. The nematode Howardula aoronymphium has substantial adverse effects on host survival and fertility on North American Drosophila. Long-term data show that rainy summers lead to a high prevalence of parasitism in the fall and the following spring, resulting in up to a 1-yr time lag between present rainfall and increased prevalence of H. aoronymphium parasitism. A biogeographic analysis of the relative abundance of different Drosophila species has shown that H. aoronymphium may facilitate the coexistence of different species of Drosophila that compete for larval food resources. The actual host range of parasites in nature is determined by the intrinsic suitability of potential hosts for parasite infection and reproduction and various ecological factors. For H. aoronymphium in eastern North America, intrinsically suitable hosts fall within a restricted clade within the genus Drosophila. However, the temperature sensitivity of H. aoronymphium prevents it from using several host species that occur outside the geographical range of the nematodes. Finally, the host range, virulence, and geographical range of Drosophila-parasitic nematodes appear to be highly dynamic over evolutionary timescales.

TI The ubiquitous and varied role of infection in the lives of animals and
   plants
AB Parasitic and symbiotic infections are major forces governing the life histories of plant and animal hosts-a fact that is ever more evident because of recent findings emanating from diverse subdisciplines of biology. Yet, infectious organisms have been relatively little investigated by biologists who study natural populations. Now that new molecular and computational tools allow us to differentiate and track microscopic infectious agents in nature, we are beginning to establish a better appreciation of their effects on larger, more familiar organisms. This special issue on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of infection for plants and animals is based on the annual Vice Presidential Symposium at the meeting of the American Society of Naturalists held in Knoxville, Tennessee, in the summer of 2001.

TI The effect of Wolbachia on genetic divergence between populations:
   Models with two-way migration
AB Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria that cause various reproduction alterations in their hosts, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), an incompatibility between sperm and egg that typically results in embryonic death. We investigate theoretically the effects of Wolbachia-induced bidirectional CI on levels of divergence between two populations, where there is migration in both directions and differential selection at a single locus. The main findings are as follows: Wolbachia differences in the two populations are maintained up to a threshold migration rate, above which the system collapses to a single Wolbachia type; differential selection at a nuclear locus increases the threshold migration rate below which Wolbachia polymorphisms are maintained; Wolbachia differences between the populations enhance their genetic divergence at the selected locus by reducing the "effective migration rate," and even moderate levels of CI can cause large population differences in allele frequencies; and asymmetric CI can induce strong asymmetries in effective migration rate and dramatically alter the pattern of genetic divergence compared with the No Wolbachia situation. We derive an analytical approximation for the effective migration rate, which matches the simulation results for most parameter values. These results generally support the view that CI Wolbachia can contribute to genetic divergence between populations.

TI Immune defense and host life history
AB Recent interest has focused on immune response in an evolutionary context, with particular attention to disease resistance as a life-history trait, subject to trade-offs against other traits such as reproductive effort. Immune defense has several characteristics that complicate this approach, however; for example, because of the risk of autoimmunity, optimal immune defense is not necessarily maximum immune defense. Two important types of cost associated with immunity in the context of life history are resource costs, those related to the allocation of essential but limited resources, such as energy or nutrients, and option costs, those paid not in the currency of resources but in functional or structural components of the organism. Resource and option costs are likely to apply to different aspects of resistance. Recent investigations into possible trade-offs between reproductive effort, particularly sexual displays, and immunity have suggested interesting functional links between the two. Although all organisms balance the costs of immune defense against the requirements of reproduction, this balance works out differently for males than it does for females, creating sex differences in immune response that in turn are related to ecological factors such as the mating system. We conclude that immune response is indeed costly and that future work would do well to include invertebrates, which have sometimes been neglected in studies of the ecology of immune defense.

TI Sexual selection and life-history decisions: Implications for supportive
   breeding and the management of captive populations
AB Natural breeding systems and various kinds of mate-choice or sperm-choice rules (e.g., as proposed in the "good genes" models of sexual selection) are expected to have important implications for the genetics of the next generation. Moreover, mate-choice decisions may be connected to life-history decisions about current and future parental effort. Considering these genetic and conditional aspects of free mating could improve the long-term success of breeding programs in conservation. In some cases, free mate choice might be more genetically advantageous than random mating because it may promote offspring health and enable host populations to react to coevolving pathogens. However, breeding systems are not evolved to avoid extinction. In small and endangered populations, some forms of natural breeding systems and mate preferences need to be carefully manipulated to avoid an extensive reduction of the effective population size (N-e). In general, supportive breeding should minimize the variance in reproductive success that is not linked to viability traits. However, minimizing reproductive skew might not be the best conservation strategy if potential mates differ in their heritable viability. If a reproductive skew can be positively linked to heritable viability or increased parental effort, there might be a way to optimize this skew with respect to the survival prospects of a population.

TI Integrating epidemiology into population viability analysis: Managing
   the risk posed by rabies and canine distemper to the Ethiopian wolf
AB Infectious disease constitutes a substantial threat to the viability of endangered species. Population viability analysis (PVA) can be a useful tool for directing conservation management when decisions must be made and information is absent or incomplete. Incorporating epidemiological dynamics explicitly into a PVA framework is technically challenging, but here we make a first attempt to integrate formal stochastic models of the combined dynamics of rabies and canine distemper into a PVA of the Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), a critically endangered canid. In the absence of disease, populations in habitat patches of every size were remarkably stable and persistent. When rabies virus was introduced, epidemics, assumed to arise from sporadic dog-to-wolf transmission, caused extinction probabilities over 50 years to rise linearly with the force of infection from the dog reservoir and particularly steeply in smaller populations. Sensitivity analysis revealed that although the overall pattern of results was not altered fundamentally by small to moderate changes in disease-transmission rates or the way in which interpack disease transmission was modeled, results were sensitive to the process of female recruitment to male-only packs. Completely protecting wolf populations from rabies through vaccination is likely to be impractical, but the model suggested that direct vaccination of as few as 20-40% of wolves against rabies might be sufficient to eliminate the largest epidemics and therefore protect populations from the very low densities that make recovery unlikely. Additional simulations suggested that the affect of periodic epidemics of canine distemper virus on wolf population persistence was likely to be slight, even when modeled together with rabies. From a management perspective, our results suggest that conservation action to protect even the smallest populations of Ethiopian wolves from rabies is both worthwhile and urgent.

TI Wolbachia interactions that determine Drosophila melanogaster survival
AB We have recently described a mutualistic symbiosis in which Wolbachia bacteria were shown to improve the fitness of some Drosophila melanogaster stocks. Wolbachia did not extend longevity in all Drosophila genotypes, even though 16s rDNA sequences indicated that our Drosophila stocks were infected with the same Wolbachia strain. Here, we use reciprocal hybrid crosses between two Drosophila strains, one that lived longer with Wolbachia (Z53) and one that did not (Z2), to investigate the inheritance of the survival phenotype and its dependence on the host genotype, sex, and mating conditions. Wolbachia's positive effects were more apparent in hybrid flies than in parental flies, ruling out exclusive maternal inheritance or the dependence of the survival phenotype on Wolbachia strain differences. The Wolbachia survival effects were more apparent in single-sex cages, where courtship and mating were not permitted. In these cages, nearly all flies with Wolbachia lived longer than uninfected flies, even though strain Z2 showed no Wolbachia effect in mixed-sex mating cages. We used comparisons between single- and mixed-sex cages to estimate the cost of reproduction for both sexes. Our data suggest that Wolbachia infection may increase the inferred cost of reproduction, particularly in males. Wolbachia can even produce a positive survival effect almost as large as the negative survival effect associated with reproduction. We discuss the implications of our experiments for the study of insect symbioses.

   paraparesis
AB Human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is one outcome of infection with HTLV-I. A population association study of 229 patients with HAM/TSP and 202 healthy carriers of HTLV-I in southern Japan showed that this outcome of HTLV-I infection and the HTLV-I provirus load are under polygenic control. Of 58 polymorphic sites studied in 39 non-HLA candidate gene loci, 3 new host genetic factors that influenced the risk of HAM/TSP or the provirus load of HTLV-I were identified. The promoter TNF-863A allele predisposed to HAM/TSP, whereas SDF-1 +801A 3'UTR, and IL-15 191C alleles conferred protection. Knowledge of HTLV-I-infected individuals' ages, sex, provirus load, HTLV-I subgroup, and genotypes at the loci HLA-A, HLA-C, SDF-1, and TNF-alpha allowed for the correct identification of 88% of cases of HAM/TSP in this Japanese cohort.

   bacteria in natural populations of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum
AB In addition to the essential intracellular symbiotic bacterium Buchnera , several facultative endosymbiotic bacteria called collectively secondary symbionts (S-symbionts) have been identified from the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum . We conducted an extensive and systematic survey of S-symbionts in Japanese local populations of A. pisum using a specific PCR detection technique. Five S-symbionts of A. pisum , PASS, PAUS, PABS, Rickettsia and Spiroplasma , and two facultative endosymbionts universally found in various insects, Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , were targeted. Of 119 isofemale strains originating from 81 localities, 66.4% of the strains possessed either of four S-symbionts: PASS (38.7%); PAUS (16.0%); Rickettsia (8.4%); and Spiroplasma (3.4%), while 33.6% of the strains contained only Buchnera . PABS, Wolbachia and Arsenophonus were not detected from the Japanese strains of A. pisum . In order to understand intra- and interpopulational diversity of S-symbiont microbiota in detail, 858 insects collected from 43 localities were examined for infection with the four S-symbionts. It was demonstrated that different S-symbionts coexist commonly in the same local populations, but double infections with two S-symbionts were rarely detected. Notably, the S-symbionts exhibited characteristic geographical distribution patterns: PASS at high frequencies all over Japan; PAUS at high frequencies mainly in the northeastern part of Japan; and Rickettsia and Spiroplasma at low frequencies sporadically in the southwestern part of Japan. These results indicate that the geographical distribution and infection frequency of the S-symbionts, in particular PAUS, might be affected by environmental and/or historical factors. Statistical analyses suggested that the distribution of PAUS infection might be related to host plant species, temperature and precipitation.

TI Disease, habitat fragmentation and conservation
AB Habitat loss and the resultant fragmentation of remaining habitat is the primary cause of loss of biological diversity. How do these processes affect the dynamics of parasites and pathogens? Hess has provided some important insights into this problem using metapopulation models for pathogens that exhibit 'S-I' dynamics; for example, pathogens such as rabies in which the host population may be divided into susceptible and infected individuals. A major assumption of Hess's models is that infected patches become extinct, rather than recovering and becoming resistant to future infections. In this paper, we build upon this framework in two different ways: first, we examine the consequences of including patches that are resistant to infection; second, we examine the consequences of including a second species of host that can act as a reservoir for the pathogen. Both of these effects are likely to be important from a conservation perspective. The results of both sets of analysis indicate that the benefits of corridors and other connections that allow species to disperse through the landscape far outweigh the possible risks of increased pathogen transmission. Even in the commonest case, where harmful pathogens are maintained by a common reservoir host, increased landscape connectance still allows greater coexistence and persistence of a threatened or endangered host.

TI Impact of recurrent epidemics of hepatitis A virus infection on
   population immunity levels: Bristol Bay, Alaska
AB The dynamics of population-based immunity were examined by using serologic surveys of 7 villages in rural Alaska between 2 epidemics of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and after the second epidemic (1988-1990). Among persons aged 2-30 years, the overall age-adjusted prevalence of antibody to HAV (anti-HAV) was 51% in 1983 and 49% in 1993 (P = .507). In children aged <5 years, prevalence rates were 0% and 11% in 1983 and 1993, respectively. The prevalence of HAV infection increased with age in both surveys. When examined by 5-year birth cohorts, anti-HAV prevalence increased in children born between 1979 and 1983 (P = .001). Between the 2 survey periods, 43 clinical cases of HAV infection were reported in these villages; all occurred from 1988 to 1990. Despite high overall prevalence of immunity, transmission during epidemics was facilitated by children aged <15 years susceptible to HAV. Little transmission occurred between epidemics. Vaccination of children against HAV should prevent future epidemics.

TI Helicobacter pylori prevalence among indigenous peoples of South America
AB The seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori among secluded Indian populations of South America was determined to gain insight into the evolutionary history and possible transmission patterns of the organism. Serum samples obtained from 1024 donors in 22 different villages were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin G antibodies, and the results were confirmed by Western blot. The overall seroprevalence was 92%: >80% of children tested positive by 3 years of age, the highest prevalence in populations studied to date. Comparison of H. pylori prevalence with that of herpes simplex virus type 1, which is known to be transmitted orally, demonstrated a linear correlation in their prevalence rates, suggesting that these pathogens share risk factors. However, H. pylori seroprevalence was consistently higher, indicating that additional routes of transmission exist and/or that the organism is more transmissible. Seroprevalence did not correlate with the length of contact with the outside world. These results suggest that H. pylori was indigenous to the South American Indians and was not introduced by contact with outsiders.

TI Age-specific prevalence of infection with herpes simplex virus types 2
   and 1: A global review
AB Information on age- and sex-specific prevalence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 2 and 1 infections is essential to optimize genital herpes control strategies, which increase in importance because accumulating data indicate that HSV-2 infection may increase acquisition and transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. This review summarizes data from peer-reviewed publications of type-specific HSV seroepidemiologic surveys. HSV-2 prevalence is, in general, highest in Africa and the Americas, lower in western and southern Europe than in northern Europe and North America, and lowest in Asia. HSV-2 and -1 prevalence, overall and by age, varies markedly by country, region within country, and population subgroup. Age-specific HSV-2 prevalence is usually higher in women than men and in populations with higher risk sexual behavior. HSV-2 prevalence has increased in the United States but national data from other countries are unavailable. HSV-1 infection is acquired during childhood and adolescence and is markedly more widespread than HSV-2 infection. Further studies are needed in many geographic areas.

This study assessed 79 men (63 with a history of genital herpes simplex virus [HSV] type 2 infection, 5 with a history of genital HSV-1 infection, and 11 with HSV-2 antibodies but no history of genital herpes) and obtained daily swabs for viral culture. HSV was isolated at least once from 60 (81%) HSV-2-seropositive men. The total viral shedding rate in HSV-2-seropositive men was 5%; the subclinical shedding rate was 2.2%. Of 11 HSV-2- seropositive men without a genital herpes history, 7 recognized typical recurrences and HSV was detected in 10. The shedding rate among men with genital HSV-2 was significantly higher than among men with genital HSV-1 infection (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-15.3). The frequency of viral shedding in men with genital herpes appears comparable with that in women.

TI A geostatistical analysis of the geographic distribution of lymphatic
   filariasis prevalence in Southern India
AB Gaining a better understanding of the spatial population structure of infectious agents is increasingly recognized as being key to their more effective mapping and to improving knowledge of their overall population dynamics and control. Here, we investigate the spatial structure of bancroftian filariasis distribution using geostatistical methods in an endemic region in Southern India. Analysis of a parasite antigenemia prevalence dataset assembled by sampling 79 villages selected using a World Health Organization (WHO) proposed 25 x 25 km grid sampling procedure in a 225 x 225 km area within this region was compared with that of a corresponding microfilaraemia prevalence dataset assembled by sampling 119 randomly selected villages from a smaller subregion located within the main study area. A major finding from the analysis was that once large-scale spatial trends were removed, the antigenemia data did not show evidence for the existence of any small-scale dependency at the study sampling interval of 25 km. By contrast, analysis of the randomly sampled microfilaraemia data indicated strong spatial contagion in prevalence up to a distance of approximately 6.6 kms, suggesting the likely existence of small spatial patches or foci of transmission in the study area occurring below the sampling scale used for sampling the antigenemia data. While this could indicate differences in parasite spatial population dynamics based on antigenemia versus microfilaraemia data, the result may also suggest that the WHO recommended 25 x 25 km sampling grid for rapid filariasis mapping could have been too coarse a scale to capture and describe the likely local variation in filariasis infection in this endemic location and highlights the need for caution when applying uniform sampling schemes in diverse endemic regions for investigating the spatial pattern of this parasitic infection. The present results, on the other hand, imply that both small-scale spatial processes and large-scale factors may characterize the observed distribution of filariasis in the study region. Our preliminary analysis of a mountain range associated large-scale trend in the antigenemia data suggested that a nonlinear relationship of infection prevalence with elevation might be a factor behind such observed global spatial patterns. We conclude that geostatistic methods can provide a powerful framework for carrying out the empirical investigation and analysis of parasite spatial population structure. This study shows that their successful application, however, will crucially depend on our gaining a more thorough understanding of the appropriate geographic scales at which spatial studies should be carried out.

TI Spread of an invasive pathogen over a variable landscape: A nonnative
   root rot on Port Orford cedar
AB Understanding biological invasions requires information on the history of spatial spread, as well as measures of landscape and biotic features that control habitat invasibility. Because invasive species often spread quickly over large areas, attaining these two sets of information simultaneously is uncommon. We studied the spread of a fatal normative root pathogen, Phytophthora lateralis, across a heterogeneous landscape of its host, Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis,lawsoniana). Within our 37-km(2) study area in southwestern Oregon and northwest California, Port Orford cedar populations are generally restricted to riparian zones along creeks. The pathogen is spread between watersheds in two ways: (1) by spore-infested material being dislodged from vehicles, and (2) by animals or people moving infested mud (i.e., via foot traffic). Using dendrochronological techniques, we determined the date of infection for dead cedars and reconstructed spread history across our study area from 1977 to 1999. Twenty-six of the 36 (72%) separate infection events we identified were caused by dispersal via vehicles along roads, and the remainder by foot traffic. Survival analysis demonstrated that cedar populations in creeks crossed by roads were more likely to be infected than those creeks that were not. crossed by roads. Also, a comparison of minimum dispersal distances showed infections that moved via road moved significantly farther than those vectored by foot traffic, and the distance infection traveled declined significantly through time. We also coupled our spread history with measures of landscape and host features, including abundance of potential host trees, the distance from the road surface to the nearest potential host, length of road in immediate contact with the riparian zone, catchment area (a measure of stream flow), elevation, slope, and solar radiation. Our results show that catchment area, host abundance, and proximity to the nearest tree are significantly and positively associated with infection risk. Our study demonstrates that increased connectivity between invasible sites created by the presence of roads can increase invasion success of a plant pathogen. We also document that successful pathogen invasion can be governed by both physical landscape features and attributes of host plant populations.

The data from this study suggest multiple molecular epidemiologic and program management uses for DNA fingerprinting in TB public health practice. From these data, we also gain a clearer understanding of the overall diversity of M. tuberculosis strains as well as the presence of endemic strains in the United States. We summarize the key findings and the impact that DNA fingerprinting may have on future approaches to TB control. Although challenges and limitations to the use of DNA fingerprinting exist, the widespread implementation of the technique into routine TB prevention and control practices appears scientifically justified.

TI Outcrossing increases infection success and competitive ability:
   Experimental evidence from a hermaphrodite parasite
AB The maintenance of two genetically distinct reproductive modes such as outcrossing and selfing within a population of animals or plants is still a matter of considerable debate. Hermaphroditic parasites often reproduce either alone by selling or in pairs by outcrossing. They can be used as a model to study potential benefits of outcrossing. Any advantage from outcrossing may be important, especially in host-parasite coevolution, but has not, to our knowledge, been studied yet in any parasite species. We studied the potential effect of outcrossing in a tapeworm, Schistocephalus solidus, on both infection success and growth in its first intermediate host, the copepod Macrocyclops albidus. Tapeworms that had been obtained from natural populations of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were allowed to reproduce either alone or in pairs, in an in vitro system that replaced the final host's gut. This resulted in either selfed or outcrossed offspring, respectively. In one part of the experiment, copepods were exposed to either selfed or outcrossed parasites, in a second part to both types simultaneously, in order to study the effect of competition between them. To discriminate parasites of either origin within the same host, a novel method for fluorescent vital labeling was used. We show here for the first time that outcrossed parasites had a higher infection success and faster development in the host. This advantage of outcrossing became apparent only in the competitive situation, in which superior abilities of parasites to extract limiting resources from the host become crucial.

TI How can sex ratio distorters reach extreme prevalences? Male-killing
   Wolbachia are not suppressed and have near-perfect vertical transmission
   efficiency in Acraea encedon
AB Maternally transmitted bacteria that kill male hosts early in their development are found in many insects. These parasites typically infect 1-30% of wild females, but in a few species of insects, prevalences exceed 95%. We investigated one such case in the butterfly Acraea encedon, which is infected with a male-killing Wolbachia bacterium. We measured three key parameters that affect the prevalence of the parasite: transmission efficiency, rate of survival of infected males, and the direct cost of infection. We observed that all wild females transmit the bacterium to all their offspring and that all infected males die in wild populations. We were unable to detect any physiological cost to infection in lab culture. These observations explain the high prevalence of the A. encedon male killer, as theory predicts that under these conditions the parasite will spread to fixation. This will occur provided the death of males provides some benefit to the surviving infected females. The problem therefore becomes why the bacterium has not reached fixation and driven the butterfly extinct due to the shortage of males. We therefore investigated whether males choose to mate with uninfected rather than infected females, as this would prevent the bacterium from reaching fixation. We tested this hypothesis in the "lekking swarms" of virgin females found in the most female-biased populations, and were unable to detect any evidence of mate choice. In conclusion, this male killer has spread to high prevalence because it has a high transmission efficiency and low cost, but the factors maintaining uninfected females in the population remain unknown.

TI The impact of gastrointestinal nematodes on wild reindeer: experimental
   and cross-sectional studies
AB 1. It is well known that gastrointestinal nematodes can have a significant impact on the growth of farmed ruminants. The clinical signs of these parasites are often subtle, with production losses mainly due to reductions in host appetite and gut function. However, little is known about the impact of this widespread group of parasites on wild ruminants. We use experiments and cross-sectional data to investigate the effects of gastrointestinal nematodes on a wild host, the Svalbard reindeer.
   2. Individually marked reindeer were treated for parasites. Their body mass, back fat depth and fecundity were compared with the control group one year later. The effect of treatment on worm burdens was investigated in a subsample of animals that were culled 3 and 6 months after treatment. Also, the relationship between the intensity of infection and body mass, back fat depth and host pregnancy rates was investigated in cross-sectional data from culled reindeer.
   3. The anthelmintic treatment caused an increase in the body mass, back fat depth and fecundity of the reindeer. Treatment depressed the abundance of adult parasites of Ostertagia gruehneri for at least 6 months, but had no significant effect on the abundance of adults of the other dominant parasite species, Marshallagi marshalli, or the abundance of larval stages of either species.
   4. In the cross-sectional study, the probability of a reindeer being pregnant in late winter was negatively related to the abundance of adult O. gruehneri when controlling for host body mass. However, no clear evidence were found for an effect of parasitism on host condition in the cross-sectional study.
   5. Our experimental results show for the first time in a natural ruminant host population that gastrointestinal nematodes can have a significant effect on host condition and fecundity. However, effects of infection on host condition was not detectable in the cross-sectional study. Also, we show that the experimental effects on host condition and fecundity is most likely to be due to a negative effect of O. gruehneri, while the experimental design did not allow detection of potential negative effects of M. marshalli.

   drug users
AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1a and 3a partial NS5B gene segment sequences obtained from 154 HCV-infected injection drug users were studied to determine the extent to which HCV transmission occurs between injection drug user communities in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow (United Kingdom), Marseilles (France), and Melbourne. Phylogenetic relationships between sequences were analyzed by conventional methods and by a recently developed method that numerically scores the extent of sequence segregation between groups through calculation of association indices. The association indices revealed that none of the cities sampled support an HCV population that is completely isolated from that circulating in the other cities. Sequences from Melbourne were most isolated, whereas those from London were most dispersed. This suggests that HCV transmission between these cities occurs, with London playing a pivotal role. The degree of city-specific segregation of HCV subtype 1a sequences was linearly related to that of subtype 3a, indicating that these subtypes have spread through similar transmission networks.

TI Wolbachia infections and superinfections in cytoplasmically incompatible
   populations of the European cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cerasi (Diptera,
   Tephritidae)
AB Wolbachia is an obligately intracellular, maternally inherited bacterium which has been detected in many arthropods. Wolbachia infections disperse in host populations by mechanisms such as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI leads to embryonic mortality which occurs when infected males mate with uninfected females or females with a different Wolbachia strain. Populations of the European cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cerasi (Diptera, Tephritidae) were found to be infected by two different Wolbachia strains, wCer1 and wCer2. Superinfections with both strains occurred throughout southern and central Europe and infections with wCer1 were found in northern, western and eastern Europe. Strong unidirectional CI between European populations of R. cerasi were first reported in the 1970s. From the conformity in the recent geographical distribution of the Wolbachia infections and the CI expression patterns found 25 years ago it was deduced that wCer2 potentially causes CI in R. cerasi. The comparison of the geographical distributions indicated that wCer1 + 2 must have spread into wCer1-infected populations in some areas. In other regions, a spread of wCer1 + 2 was probably prevented by dispersal barriers. There, a sharp transition from infected to superinfected populations suggested regional isolation between wCer1 and wCer1 + 2-infected populations.

TI A plant pathogen reduces the enemy-free space of an insect herbivore on
   a shared host plant
AB An important mechanism in stabilizing tightly linked host-parasitoid and prey-predator interactions is the presence of refuges that protect organisms from their natural enemies. However, the presence and quality of refuges can be strongly affected by the environment. We show that infection of the host plant Silene latifolia by its specialist fungal plant pathogen Microbotryum violaceum dramatically alters the enemy-free space of a herbivore, the specialist noctuid seed predator Hadena bicruris, on their shared host plant. The pathogen arrests the development of seed capsules that serve as refuges for the herbivore's offspring against the specialist parasitoid Microplitis tristis, a major source of mortality of H. bicruris in the field. Pathogen infection resulted both in lower host-plant food quality, causing reduced adult emergence, and in twofold higher rates of parasitism of the herbivore. We interpret the strong oviposition preference of H. bicruris for uninfected plants in the field as an adaptive response, positioning offspring on refuge-rich, high-quality hosts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that plant-inhabiting micro-organisms can affect higher trophic interactions through alteration of host refuge quality. We speculate that such interference can potentially destabilize tightly linked multitrophic interactions.

TI Programmed cell death correlates with virus transmission in a
   filamentous fungus
AB Programmed cell death (PCD) is an essential part of the defence response in plants and animals against pathogens. Here, we report that PCD is also involved in defence against pathogens of fungi. Vegetative incompatibility is a self/non-self recognition system in fungi that results in PCD when cells of incompatible strains fuse. We quantified the frequency of cell death associated with six vegetative incompatibility (vic) genes in the filamentous ascomycete fungus Cryphonectria parasitica. Cell death frequencies were compared with the effects of vic genes on transmission of viruses between the same strains. We found a significant negative correlation between cell death and virus transmission. We also show that asymmetry in cell death correlates with asymmetry in virus transmission; greater transmission occurs into vic genotypes that exhibit delayed or infrequent PCD after fusion with an incompatible strain. Furthermore, we found that virus infection can have a significant, strain-specific, positive or negative effect on PCD. Specific interactions between vie gene function and viruses, along with correlations between cell death and transmission, strongly implicate PCD as a host-mediated pathogen defence strategy in fungi.

TI Association of a polymorphism in the P2X(7) gene with tuberculosis in a
   Gambian population
AB Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ligation of P2X(7) receptors expressed on human macrophages that are infected with mycobacteria induces cell death and subsequent loss of intracellular bacterial viability. Marked heterogeneity observed in cell donor ATP responsiveness suggests that this antimycobacterial mechanism may be genetically regulated. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified in a putative 1.8-kb promoter region upstream of P2RX7 exon 1 were screened for associations with clinical tuberculosis. The frequencies of these promoter SNPs and a polymorphism in P2RX7 exon 13 at position 1513 were compared among >300 Gambian patients with tuberculosis and 1 160 ethnically matched control subjects by sequence-specific oligonucleotide hybridization and ligation detection reaction analysis. A significant protective association against tuberculosis was found for 1 promoter SNP, at nucleotide position -762 (odds ratio [OR] for variant C allele, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.89; P = .003; OR for CC genotype, 0.545; 95% CI, 0.318-0.934; P = .027). This association supports a role for ATP/P2X(7)-mediated host regulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

TI Malaria infections are randomly distributed in diverse holoendemic areas
   of Papua New Guinea
AB Malaria is holoendemic in the lowlands of Papua New Guinea (PNG), and interactions among Plasmodium species may influence prevalence of mixed infections. Previously, field samples from a cross-sectional survey in Dreikikir, East Sepik Province, analyzed by blood smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), showed that mixed infections were common and randomly distributed in this malaria endemic region. To evaluate further whether Plasmodium species distribution is random, blood smear- and PCR/sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization-based analyses of cross-sectional survey samples were conducted in 2 additional malaria holoendemic regions of northern PNG. Despite ecologic, species prevalence, and transmission season differences in these new surveys, all 4 Plasmodium species were found to be randomly distributed in each area; random distribution patterns also were observed when study populations were divided into age groups. These findings provide consistent evidence that Plasmodium species infections occur independently of one another in PNG malaria holoendemic sites. This independent occurrence suggests that age-dependent, acquired malaria immunity has limited influence on the distribution pattern of Plasmodium species infections in endemic human populations; infection by 1 human malaria parasite species does not reduce susceptibility to infection by others; and malaria vaccines would exhibit limited protection against blood-stage infection by heterologous Plasmodium species.

TI A biologic basis for integrated malaria control
AB In a series of models of Plasmodium falciparum dynamics, spontaneous local extinctions of the parasite sometimes occurred under steady, perennial-transmission conditions. These extinctions occurred only with extremely low mosquito densities or when the parameter describing the duration of human infection-blocking immunity was at its maximum value, and, simultaneously, those describing vector survivorship and the duration of human infectivity were at their minimum values. The range and frequency of extinctions increased with seasonal transmission, and decreased with the emergence of recombinant genotypes. Here we extend the immunity parameter up to levels that would describe a successful vaccine, and examine the combined influences of seasonality, genotype cross-reactivity, meiotic recombination, and human population turnover on parasite persistence. As Ross did 90 years ago, we conclude that malaria control programs that encompass several methods and targets of intervention are the most likely to succeed. Success is more likely if programs are cognizant of local circumstances of transmission, and, within that context, aim to reduce vector survivorship and human infectivity as well as augment human immunity.

TI Cytokine responses during acute simian Plasmodium cynomolgi and
   Plasmodium knowlesi infections
AB Experimental infection of non-human primates with simian malaria parasites offers a controlled system to study malarial immunity. Plasmodium cynomolgi (P. vivax-like) and P. knowlesi (P. falciparum-like) infections in the rhesus monkey were used as a model to test the hypothesis that initial acute infection stimulates type 1/pro-inflammatory cytokine expression followed by a gradual type 2/anti-inflammatory response upon re-infection. This study analyzed cytokine gene expression (interleukin-12, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha = type 1; interleukin-4, interleukin-10 type 2) using a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in monkeys infected with each of the parasites (three per group). Clinicoparasitologic and serologic parameters were also monitored. Monkeys were reinfected to assess whether enhanced immunity could increase parasite clearance. The immune response to P. cynomolgi infection in rhesus monkeys seemed to be mediated by anti-parasite, pro-inflammatory responses during primary infection with a transition to protective type 2 responses after repeat infection. The immune responses to P. knowlesi infection were more varied. Anti-inflammatory responses were more prevalent during primary infection. Repeat infection stimulated a wide variety of responses, most included expression of tumor necrosis factor-a, a cytokine that has been associated with inflammatory and host-destructive effects (weight loss, fever, anemia). These observations further confirmed that the simian malaria/rhesus monkey model is well suited for studies on the regulation of immunity to acute Plasmodium infection.

TI Epidemic of hepatitis E in a military unit in Abbottabad, Pakistan
AB An outbreak of hepatitis caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Abbottabad, Pakistan was traced to fecal contamination of a water system. Of 109 men hospitalized with hepatitis, 104 (95%) had serologic evidence of acute hepatitis E (IgM antibody to HEV [anti-HEV]), three (3%) probably had acute hepatitis E (high titers of IgG anti-HEV without IgM), and two had acute hepatitis A. Among a subset of 44 men with acute hepatitis E from whom three serum specimens were obtained over a four-month period, the anti-HEV IgG geometric mean titers (GMTs) decreased from 1 519 during the outbreak to 657 at four months. The IgM anti-HEV was detected in 40 (91%) of 44 sera obtained at admission (GMT = 533 during acute disease). but in only six (14%) four months later. The prevalence of anti-HEV in this population before the outbreak was estimated to e 30%. The presence of IgG anti-HEV appeared to protect against clinical hepatitis or development of serologic evidence of new infection with HEV. This is the second major epidemic of hepatitis E in the Pakistani military confirmed by an anti-HEV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Evidence that pre-existing antibody as measured by this ELISA protects against disease is important for assessment of vaccine development.

All 10 became infected and were able to transmit WNV at some level. Ochlerotatus, Culiseta, and Aedes were low to moderately efficient vectors. They feed primarily on mammals and could play a secondary role in transmission. Oc. sierrensis, a major pest species, and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus from southern California were the least efficient laboratory vectors. Cx. tarsalis, Cx. stigmatosoma, Cx. erythrothorax, and other populations of Cx. pipiens complex were the most efficient laboratory vectors. Culex species are likely to play the primary role in the enzootic maintenance and transmission of WNV in California.

TI Identifying reservoirs of infection: A conceptual and practical
   challenge
AB Many infectious agents, especially those that cause emerging diseases, infect more than one host species. Managing reservoirs of multihost pathogens often plays a crucial role in effective disease control. However, reservoirs remain variously and loosely defined. We propose that reservoirs can only be understood with reference to defined target populations. Therefore, we define a reservoir as one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population. Existence of a reservoir is confirmed when infection within the target population cannot be sustained after all transmission between target and nontarget populations has been eliminated. When disease can be controlled solely by interventions within target populations, little knowledge of potentially complex reservoir infection dynamics is necessary for effective control. We discuss the practical value of different approaches that may be used to identify reservoirs in the field.

TI Evidence for insect transmission of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus
AB The spread of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) virus from quarantine on Wardang Island to mainland Australia in 1995 suggested that insects could be potential vectors. Field observations and laboratory experiments were conducted to address aspects of this hypothesis. Firstly, the variation in insect populations on the island during the field trials was examined. There was approximately a 1000-fold increase in the number of bushflies, Musca vetustissima, shortly before the spread of the virus. Secondly, M. vetustissima were tested in the laboratory as potential vectors of RHD virus, and it was demonstrated that disease could be transmitted between rabbits by flies. Finally, 13 of 16 insect samples, collected from Wardang Island and from several sites on the mainland following the spread of virus off the island, were positive for the presence of RHD virus by a specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Only one sample contained sufficient infectious virus to kill a susceptible rabbit. These data, combined with previously published information on fly biology, suggested that flies, particularly bushflies, may be involved in the transmission of RHD virus. Other possible routes of spread were not assessed in this study.

TI Epidemiological consequences of a pathogen having both virulent and
   avirulent modes of transmission: the case of rabbit haemorrhagic disease
   virus
AB A number of pathogens cause chronic infection in survivors of acute disease and this is believed to be a common means of persistence, including for highly virulent agents. We present a model in which transmission from chronically infected hosts causes chronic infection in naive individuals, without causing acute disease-indeed 'protecting' against it. Thus the pathogen obtains the benefit of virulence (high transmission rate), but mitigates against the cost (high host mortality). Recent findings suggest that rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a highly contagious and virulent pathogen, may also utilize this alternative, 'avirulent', mode of transmission. The model may resolve the paradox of how RHDV can be highly prevalent in some populations, in the absence of mortality. Differences in host demography determine whether avirulent transmission prevents large-scale mortality (as in most UK populations) or not. Other pathogens may exhibit similar behaviour and the implications for emerging diseases in general are discussed.

AB Host-parasite coevolution was studied between Sparidae (Teleostei) fishes and their parasites of the genus Lamellodiscus (Monogenea, Diplectanidae) in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Molecular phylogenies were reconstructed for both groups. The phylogenetic tree of the Sparidae was obtained from previously published 16S mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences associated with new cytochrome-b mtDNA sequences via a "total evidence" procedure. The phylogeny of Lamellodiscus species was reconstructed from 18S rDNA sequences that we obtained. Host-parasite coevolution was studied through different methods: TreeFitter, TreeMap, and a new method, ParaFit. If the cost of a host switch is not assumed to be high for parasites, all methods agree on the absence of widespread cospeciation processes in this host-parasite system. Host-parasite associations were interpreted to be due more to ecological factors than to coevolutionary processes. Host specificity appeared not to be related to host-parasite cospeciation.

TI Exploiting circuit-specific spread of pseudorabies virus in the central
   nervous system: Insights to pathogenesis and circuit tracers
AB The neurotropic alpha-herpesviruses are common mammalian pathogens that invade the peripheral and central nervous system of their hosts. Their ability to invade and spread in the nervous system in a directional manner has been exploited to develop them as neuronal circuit tracers. Tracing viruses spread among synaptically connected neurons and, by assaying brain sections for viral antigen or reporter genes expressed from the viruses, chains of synaptically connected neurons can be visualized. Virulent field strains generally are not good tracers, but some attenuated strains perform well. Live attenuated vaccine strains of pseudorabies virus (PRV), such as PRV Bartha, are among the most popular virus circuit tracers. It may be counterintuitive that attenuation results in improved neural tracing that requires extensive replication and spread in the brain. This report summarizes two lines of experiments directed to resolving this apparent paradox and introduces a new paradigm for tracing viruses.

These methods enable researchers to study previously inaccessible aspects of this disease and allow a more detailed analysis of virus/host immune responses as they relate to disease specificity in this disorder. The role of HTLV- I-specific CD8 T cell immune responses is highlighted.

TI Glial cell responses to herpesvirus infections: Role in defense and
   immunopathogenesis
AB Glial cells can respond to herpesvirus infections through the production of cytokines and chemokines. Although specific interactions between resident glia and lymphocytes that infiltrate the infected brain remain to be defined, the presence of T cell chemotactic signals in microglial cell supernatants following infection with cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus has led to the concept that chemokines initiate a cascade of neuroimmune responses that result in defense of the brain against herpesviruses. While chemokines may play a defensive role by attracting T cells into the brain, aberrant accumulation of lymphocytes may also induce brain damage. Host defense mechanisms must balance control of herpesvirus spread with associated undesirable immunopathologic effects. A growing body of evidence suggests that through complex networks of chemokines and cytokines produced in response to herpesvirus infection, glial cells orchestrate a cascade of events that result in successful defense of or damage to the brain.

TI Neuronal survival strategies in the face of RNA viral infection
AB Neurons of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) are an essential and largely nonrenewable cell population. Thus, viral infections that result in neuronal depletion, either by viral lysis or by induction of the cytolytic immune response, would likely lead to profound neurologic impairment. However, many viral infections that result in tissue destruction elsewhere in the host produce few overt symptoms in the CNS, despite readily detectable virus expression. This observation has lead to the speculation that neurons possess strategies to limit the replication and spread of otherwise cytopathic viruses. These strategies either favor the clearance of virus in the absence of appreciable neuronal loss or promote the establishment of noncytolytic persistent infections. This review discusses some of these strategies, with an emphasis on how such survival techniques lessen the potential for CNS neuropathology.

TI Immunopathogenesis of cerebral toxoplasmosis
AB Interferon (IFN)-gamma is an absolute requirement for resistance against acute acquired infection with Toxoplasma gondii and development of toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) during the late stage of infection. Multiple populations of both T and non-T cells are important sources of IFN-gamma in resistance. In the absence of IFN-gamma-producing non-T cells, T cells cannot prevent TE. Interleukin-12, Bcl-3, NF-kappaB(2), and CD40-CD40L ligand interaction are important for up-regulation of IFN-gamma production. T. gondii infects a variety of host cells, and IFN-gamma-mediated immune responses control the parasite in both phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells through at least five different mechanisms, most likely depending on the types of cells responding to IFN-gamma. Such effector functions involve production of NO by iNOS, tryptophan degradation by the enzyme IDO (indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase), unidentified mechanism(s) mediated by 47- to 48-kDa proteins encoded by an IFN-gamma responsive gene family, limiting the availability of intracellular iron to the parasite, and production of reactive oxygen intermediates.

TI Malaria vaccines: where are we and where are we going?
AB Malaria is still killing over one million people each year and its incidence is increasing. The need for an effective vaccine is greater than ever. A major difficulty with vaccine research is that the malaria parasite presents thousands of antigens to the human immune system that vary throughout its life cycle. Identifying those that may prove to be vaccine targets is complicated and time consuming. Most vaccines are targeted at individual stages of the malaria life cycle, although it is likely that only the development of a multistage vaccine will offer complete protection to both visitors to, and residents of, a malaria-endemic area. With the development of a successful vaccine other issues such as cost, distribution, education, and compliance will have to be addressed. This review describes some of the current vaccine candidates for immunising against malaria.

AB European wild rabbits originated in southwestern Europe but have been introduced into many other countries world-wide, becoming serious pests in many instances. As a consequence of rabbits being regarded so differently, applied research for their management often has opposing goals, namely their conservation or their control. Furthermore, modern gene technology has led to the concept of using genetically modified myxoma viruses for rabbit management, again with quite contrary aims in mind. In this paper we explain the possible ecological and economic consequences of using these genetically modified viruses inappropriately and we consider whether national and international regulations are sufficient to prevent improper use. If international regulations are inadequate, molecular biologists and ecologists must consider the consequences of their research and advice beyond their own country to avoid unwanted impacts.

TI Interleukin-10, polymorphism in SLC11A1 (formerly NRAMP1), and
   susceptibility to tuberculosis
AB Host genetic factors are major determinants of susceptibility to tuberculosis, and an understanding of the molecular basis of this observation has major implications for the development of novel therapies and vaccines. Slc11a1 (formerly Nramp1), the first murine infection susceptibility locus identified, regulates early innate responses to intracellular pathogens. Variation in the human homologue SLC11A1 is associated with and linked to tuberculosis in genetically different populations. In a case-control study of 329 tuberculosis case patients and 324 control subjects, the association between allele 2 of a functional SLC11A1 polymorphism and tuberculosis has been reproduced. This variant is associated with higher lipopolysaccharide-induced production of the macrophage-deactivating cytokine interleukin-10. Furthermore, monocytes from persons who develop tuberculosis innately produce more interleukin-10 than do monocytes from healthy control subjects. These data therefore confirm the importance of SLC11A1 in tuberculosis susceptibility in humans and suggest that SLC11A1 influences tuberculosis susceptibility by regulation of interleukin-10.

TI Space and the persistence of male-killing endosymbionts in insect
   populations
AB Male-killing bacteria are bacteria that are transmitted vertically through the females of their insect hosts. They can distort the sex ratio of their hosts by killing infected male offspring. In nature, male-killing endosymbionts (male killers) often have a 100% efficient vertical transmission, and multiple male-killing bacteria infecting a single population are observed. We use different model formalisms to study these observations. In mean-field models a male killer with perfect transmission drives the host population to extinction, and coexistence between multiple male killers within one population is impossible; however, in spatially explicit models, both phenomena are readily observed. We show how the spatial pattern formation underlies these results. In the case of high transmission efficiencies, waves with a high density of male killers alternate with waves of mainly wild-type hosts. The male killers cause local extinction, but this creates an opportunity for uninfected hosts to re-invade these areas. Spatial pattern formation also creates an opportunity for two male killers to coexist within one population: different strains create spatial regions that are qualitatively different; these areas then serve as different niches, making coexistence possible.

   parasite species to the mosquito vector
AB The role of species interactions in structuring parasite communities remains controversial. Here, we show that interspecific competition between two avian malaria parasite species, Plasmodium gallinaceum and P. juxtanucleare, occurs as a result of interference during parasite fertilization within the bloodmeal of the mosquito. The significant reduction in the transmission success of P. gallinaceum to mosquitoes, due to the co-infecting P. juxtanucleare, is predicted to have compromised its colonization of regions occupied by P. juxtanucleare and, thus, may have contributed to the restricted global distribution of P. gallinaceum. Such interspecies interactions may occur between human malaria parasites and, thus, impact upon parasite species epidemiology, especially in regions of seasonal transmission.

TI Temperature checks the Red Queen? Resistance and virulence in a
   fluctuating environment
AB Numerous studies have revealed genetic variation in resistance and susceptibility in host-parasite interactions and therefore the potential for frequency-dependent selection (Red Queen dynamics). Few studies, if any, have considered the abiotic environment as a mediating factor in these interactions. Using the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and its fungal pathogen, Erynia neoaphidis , as a model host-parasite system, we demonstrate how temperature can mediate the expression of genotypic variation for susceptibility and virulence. Whilst previous studies have revealed among-clone variation in aphid resistance to this pathogen, we show that resistance rankings derived from assessments at one temperature, are not conserved across differing temperature regimes. We suggest that variation in environmental temperature, through its nonlinear impact on parasite virulence and host defence, may contribute to the general lack of evidence for frequency-dependent selection in field systems.

By creating resin-free and resin-rich experimental nests, we demonstrate that this resin inhibits the growth of microorganisms in a context mimicking natural conditions. Such a collective medication probably confers major ecological advantages, and may be an unrecognized yet common feature of large, complex and successful societies.

The only tick species observed in the woodland study site was Nodes trianguliceps, and ruminant reservoir hosts were not known to occur. A. phagocytophila infections were detected in both bank voles and wood mice but were restricted to periods of peak nymphal and adult tick activity. Most PCR-positive rodents were positive only once, suggesting that rodent infections are generally short-lived and that ticks rather than rodents may maintain the infection over winter. Bank voles were more likely to be PCR positive than wood mice, possibly because detectable infections are longer lived in bank voles. This study confirms that woodland rodents can maintain A. phagocytophila in Great Britain in the absence of other reservoir hosts and suggests that I. trianguliceps is a competent vector.

AB In the period 1992-2000, the Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre collected standardized epidemiologic data on 1,877 general outbreaks of Norovirus (formerly "Norwalk-like virus") infection in England and Wales. Seventy-nine percent of general outbreaks occurred in health-care institutions, i.e., hospitals (40%) and residential-care facilities (39%). When compared with outbreaks in other settings, those in health-care institutions were unique in exhibiting a winter peak (p<0.0001); these outbreaks were also associated with significantly higher death rates and prolonged duration but were smaller in size and less likely to be foodborne. These data suggest that Norovirus infection has considerable impact on the health service and the vulnerable populations residing in institutions such as hospitals and residential homes. A distinct outbreak pattern in health-care institutions suggests a combination of host, virologic, and environmental factors that mediate these divergent epidemiologic patterns.

TI Pathogen survival trajectories: An eco-environmental approach to the
   modeling of human campylobacteriosis ecology
AB Campylobacteriosis, like many human diseases, has its own ecology in which the propagation of human infection and disease depends on pathogen survival and finding new hosts in order to replicate and sustain the pathogen population. The complexity of this process, a process common to other enteric pathogens, has hampered control efforts. Many unknowns remain, resulting in a poorly understood disease ecology. To provide structure to these unknowns and help direct further research and intervention, we propose an eco-environmental modeling approach for campy-lobacteriosis. This modeling approach follows the pathogen population as it moves through the environments that define the physical structure of its ecology. In this paper, we term the ecologic processes and environments through which these populations move "pathogen survival trajectories." Although such a modeling approach could have veterinary applications, our emphasis is on human campylobacteriosis and focuses on human exposures to Campylobacter through feces, food, and aquatic environments. The pathogen survival trajectories that lead to human exposure include ecologic filters that limit population size, e.g., cooking food to kill Campylobacter. Environmental factors that influence the size of the pathogen reservoirs include temperature, nutrient availability, and moisture availability during the period of time the pathogen population is moving through the environment between infected and susceptible hosts. We anticipate that the modeling approach proposed here will work symbiotically with traditional epidemiologic and microbiologic research to help guide and evaluate the acquisition of new knowledge about the ecology, eventual intervention, and control of campylobacteriosis.

AB 1. Using field data published in the literature, we investigated pathogen dynamics and conditions of persistence in a mathematical model of the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus )-Puumala hantavirus system. The host population is assumed to have a 3-year periodic cycle. The duration of very low host density is critical for virus transmission and survival.
   2. Field epidemiological data strongly suggested a transmission of the hantavirus by the contaminated environment. We thus studied whether this 'indirect' transmission affected the virus persistence in the host population.

The model assumptions were derived from the following conditions found in the literature: (1) there is no additional mortality nor fecundity loss due to the virus in infected hosts, thus the cyclic demographical pattern is not due to the virus; (2) no remission has been observed, thus we did not consider the existence of recovered individuals; (3) adult females are territorial and juveniles disperse to find a new territory and reach sexual maturity. A fragmented landscape was assumed to occur: individuals can live in favourable or unfavourable patches.
   4. The model was a compartmental model; the population was structured into susceptible or infectious individuals. We considered two age classes, juveniles and adults, and two sites (populations) connected by juvenile dispersal.
   5. Model dynamics accurately predicted the cyclic trend in disease prevalence as observed in epidemiological studies. They also showed that indirect transmission significantly increased the probability for the virus to persist during the low-density period of the host population. More precisely, even a low survival rate of the virus outside the host was sufficient to decrease extinction risk of the infection by stochastic events.
   6. Elasticity analysis showed a high robustness of the model to changes in the parameters of indirect transmission but a high sensitivity to changes in adult density.

TI Group living and investment in immune defence: an interspecific analysis
AB 1. Since parasite transmission is often density-dependent, group living is normally thought to lead to an increased exposure to parasitism. As a consequence, it is predicted that animals living in groups will invest more resources (energy, time, risk, etc.) in parasite defence than those living solitarily.
   2. We tested this prediction by measuring basal immune parameters in the larvae of 12 species of Lepidoptera, grouped into six phylogenetically matched species-pairs, each comprising one solitary feeding and one gregariously feeding species.
   3. Contrary to expectation, the solitary species in all six species-pairs had higher total haemocyte counts than the gregarious species, and in five out of six species-pairs the solitary species also exhibited higher phenoloxidase activity. Both measurements were positively correlated with each other and with the magnitude of the cellular encapsulation response.
   4. The relationship between infection risk and group living was investigated with a dynamic, spatially explicit, host-pathogen model. This shows that when individuals aggregate in groups, the per capita risk of infection can be reduced if the lower between-group transmission more than compensates for the higher within-group transmission.
   5. We conclude that the expectation that group living always leads to increased exposure to pathogens and parasites is overly simplistic, and that the specific details of the social system in question will determine if there is increased or decreased exposure to infection.

TI Identifying disease reservoirs in complex systems: mountain hares as
   reservoirs of ticks and louping-ill virus, pathogens of red grouse
AB 1. We examined the role of mountain hares in the louping-ill virus/Ixodes ricinus tick system to determine whether hares were reservoirs of these pathogens for red grouse. A field experiment, which involved reducing mountain hare densities was undertaken and changes in tick abundance, louping-ill virus seroprevalence and red grouse densities recorded.
   2. Hares were found to be important hosts for all stages of ticks at two study sites and, where sheep were frequently treated with acaricide, hares fed the greatest proportion of adult ticks. Hare densities were reduced at the experimental site between 1993 and 2001 but remained relatively constant at a control site. Both nymph and larvae tick burdens on red grouse chicks declined over this period to very low levels at the treatment site, but not at the control site. The estimated size of the tick population at the treatment site decreased by more than 99% by 1999.
   3. Louping-ill prevalence, as measured by antibody prevalence in shot young red grouse, also declined at the treatment site, lagging behind the tick decline by approximately 2 years. The number of young grouse produced per hen grouse at this treatment site increased in comparison to a second control area. However, no change was found in summer grouse densities and thus we cannot demonstrate parasite-mediated competition.
   4. A deterministic SIR-type model describing the dynamics of this pathogen/vector/host system was constructed and used to examine the role of mountain hares in louping-ill virus and tick dynamics. The model predicted a decline in tick numbers and seroprevalence as hare densities reduced. The inclusion of hares as both tick hosts and vector-host-vector transmitters of louping-ill virus gave the best fit to the observed data.

TI Levels of selection in positive-strand virus dynamics
AB Conflicting selection pressures occurring over the life cycle of an organism constitute serious challenges to the robustness of replication. Viruses present a credible model system for analysing problems that arise through evolutionary conflicts of interest. We present a multi-level selection model for the life cycle of positive-strand RNA viruses. The model combines within-cell replication kinetics and protein synthesis, and between-cell population dynamics of virion production and transmission. We show how these two levels of within-host selection interact to produce tradeoffs in the life history strategy of a virus without consideration of host mortality. We find that viruses evolve towards intermediate rather than maximum encapsidation rates. This can be interpreted as selection for intermediate virulence through cellular persistence. We characterize a theoretical persistence threshold arising from the trade-off between genome replication and genetic translation within the cell. We present counter-intuitive relationships whereby increasing genome decay rates and rates of encapsidation lead to increases in the abundance of virus-encoded proteins. Data from poliovirus suggest that viruses might be unable to resolve the vertical conflicts of interests among different levels of selection.

TI Heritability of resistance against ectoparasitism in the
   Drosophila-Macrocheles system
AB Ectoparasites are abundant in natural communities, can have pronounced deleterious fitness consequences to their host and are important vectors of transmissible parasitic disease. Yet very few studies have estimated the magnitude of heritable genetic variation underlying resistance against ectoparasitism, which significantly limits our ability to predict the evolution of this ecologically important character. The present paper reports results of artificial selection for increased resistance in Drosophila nigrospiracula against ectoparasitic, haematophagous mites, Macrocheles subbadius. In this system, which occurs naturally in the Sonoran Desert of North America, ectoparasitism significantly damages the expression of host fitness traits, including longevity, fecundity and male mating success. In the present study, resistance, which was modelled as a threshold trait, responded significantly to selection applied on either sex. Realized heritability, calculated as a mean across four replicates, was estimated to be 0.152 +/- 0.014 (SE). The heritability estimate from selection on males did not differ from that on females, but both estimates differed significantly from zero. This documented presence of additive genetic variation for resistance, coupled with knowledge of the fitness consequences of ectoparasitism, indicates that the host population possesses significant evolutionary potential. Selection was applied on the pre-attachment phase, thereby targeting behavioural forms of defence. This study therefore establishes parallels between insects and other animals in their ability to protect themselves and evolve behavioural defences against ectoparasites.

   interleukin-4 and interleukin-4 receptor alpha polymorphisms
AB The association of variants of genes encoding interleukin (IL)-4 and the IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4Ralpha) with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis was examined in hospitalized infants. Polymorphisms in IL-4 (C-590T) and IL-4Ralpha (I50V and Q551R) were genotyped by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis. Control subjects included parents of the hospitalized children (for the transmission/ disequilibrium test), and a random population sample (for the case-control study). Results were also analyzed in a combination of these 2 tests, using Fisher's method. The IL-4 590T allele was found more frequently among children hospitalized with RSV than expected in the case-control (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; P = .04) and combination (OR, 1.41; P = .02) tests. Among children who were >6 months old when they were hospitalized, compared with the control group or with the <6 months old who were hospitalized for RSV infection, higher frequencies of both the IL-4 590T allele and the IL-4R&alpha; R551 allele were found. These results indicate that gain-of-function variants of T helper type 2 cytokine genes may play a role in increasing the severity of RSV disease, which appears more pronounced after the first half-year of life.

   vaccination in Taiwan
AB The long-term immunogenicity of universal hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine is seldom studied in large-scale prospective community-based populations, especially in adolescents. This study enrolled 1200 children aged 7 years with complete HBV immunization in infancy and determined HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), its antibody (anti-HBs), and HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) annually until the children were aged 14 years. Eleven children had new HBV infections with anti-HBc positivity as the only marker. None became positive for HBsAg or had detectable HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction. The percentage of protective anti-HBs in 951 children without booster vaccination gradually decreased from 71.1% at age 7 years to 37.4% at age 12 years. Only 1 of the 200 children in the booster group and 2 of the 258 children in the nonbooster group developed new anti-HBc positivity. The results suggest that routine booster vaccination may not be required to provide protection against chronic HBV infection before age 15 years.

TI The maintenance of sex in parasites
AB The maintenance of sex is an unresolved paradox in evolutionary biology, given the inherent twofold fitness advantage for asexuals. Parasitic helminths offer a unique opportunity to address this enigma. Parasites that can create novel antigenic strains are able to escape pre-existing host immunity. Viruses produce diversity through mutation with rapid clonal proliferation. The long generation times of helminth parasites prevent them from adopting this strategy. Instead, we argue that sexual reproduction enables parasitic helminths to rapidly generate strain diversity. We use both a stochastic, individual-based model and a simple analytical model to assess the selective value of sexual versus asexual reproduction in helminth parasites. We demonstrate that sexual reproduction can more easily produce and maintain strain diversity than asexual reproduction for long-lived parasites. We also show that sexual parasite populations are resistant to invasion by rare asexual mutants. These results are robust to high levels of cross-immunity between strains. We suggest that the enhancement of strain diversity, despite stochastic extinction of strains, may be critical to the evolutionary success of sex in long-lived parasites.

TI Cooperation, virulence and siderophore production in bacterial parasites
AB Kin selection theory predicts that the damage to a host resulting from parasite infection (parasite virulence) will be negatively correlated to the relatedness between parasites within the host. This occurs because a lower relatedness leads to greater competition for host resources, which favours rapid growth to achieve greater relative success within the host, and that higher parasite growth rate leads to higher virulence. We show that a biological feature of bacterial infections can lead to the opposite prediction: a positive correlation between relatedness and virulence. This occurs because a high relatedness can favour greater (cooperative) production of molecules that scavenge iron (siderophores), which results in higher growth rates and virulence. More generally, the same underlying idea can predict a positive relationship between relatedness and virulence in any case where parasites can cooperate to increase their growth rate; other examples include immune suppression and the production of biofilms to aid colonization.

TI Modelling pathogen transmission: the interrelationship between local and
   global approaches
AB We describe two spatial (cellular automaton) host-pathogen models with contrasting types of transmission, where the biologically realistic transmission mechanisms are based entirely on 'local' interactions. The two models, fixed contact area (FCA) and fixed contact number (FCN), may be viewed as local 'equivalents' of commonly used global density- (and frequency-) dependent models. Their outputs are compared with each other and with the patterns generated by these global terms. In the FCN model, unoccupied cells are bypassed, but in the FCA model these impede pathogen spread, extending the period of the epidemic and reducing the prevalence of infection when the pathogen persists. Crucially, generalized linear modelling reveals that the global transmission terms betaSI and beta'SI/N are equally good at describing transmission in both the FCA and FCN models when infected individuals are homogeneously distributed and N is approximately constant, as at the quasi-equilibrium. However, when N varies, the global frequency-dependent term beta'SI/N is better than the density-dependent one, betaSI, at describing transmission in both the FCA and FCN models. Our approach may be used more generally to compare different local contact structures and select the most appropriate global transmission term.

   with hemophilia and selection for genotypic X4 virus
AB The relationship among CCR5 genotype, cytomegalovirus infection, and disease progression and death was studied among 159 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with hemophilia. One patient (0.6%) had the CCR5Delta32/CCR5Delta32 genotype (which occurs in similar to2% of the Scandinavian population) and a rapid disease course. His HIV V3 region contained genotypic features attributable to X4 virus and resembled functionally verified X4 virus and virus from patients treated with a CD4 cell-stimulating drug, tucaresol. Age-related differences in disease progression rate and survival time were seen for CCR5/CCR5 patients. Surprisingly, no protective effect of the CCR5/CCR5Delta32 genotype on disease progression or survival was seen for children but was evident for adults. Age group-related immunologic differences might explain this variation, and transmission route and/or viral phenotype variation within donor virus may be related to the limited protection of the CCR5Delta32/ CCR5Delta32 genotype. Sequence comparisons indicate that X4 virus can be selected in vivo due to either absence of CCR5 receptors or relative increase of CXCR4 receptors.

TI Transmission of mixed Plasmodium species and Plasmodium falciparum
   genotypes
AB We studied malaria transmission by comparing parasite populations in humans and mosquito vectors at the household level. Blood samples were collected from all inhabitants for microscopic detection of gametocytes and polymerase chain reaction analysis. The next morning, blood-fed resting mosquitoes were collected inside the bed nets used by the individuals surveyed the previous afternoon. After 8 days of maintenance, mosquitoes were dissected, and midguts and salivary glands were recovered for polymerase chain reaction analysis. Results showed that parasite distribution was the same in the 2 hosts when compared at each household but was different when whole populations were analyzed. Different associations of Plasmodium species seem to occur in humans (Plasmodium falciparum/ Plasmodium malariae) and mosquitoes (P. falciparum/Plasmodium ovale). Regarding P. falciparum infections, a higher proportion of single-genotype infections and less allele diversity are observed in mosquitoes than in humans.

TI Genetic conflicts over sex ratio: Mite-endosymbiont interactions
AB Nucleocytoplasmic genetic conflicts arise as a result of asymmetric transmission of cytoplasmic and nuclear genes. Spread of a cytoplasmic element promoting female-biased sex ratios creates selection on nuclear genes for mechanisms that decrease the bias. Here we investigate the conflict over sex ratio between the cytoplasmic bacterium Wolbachia and the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch. We show that, first, infected females produce significantly more female-biased sex ratios than uninfected (cured) females. Second, this effect is not due to parthenogenesis, male killing, or feminization, phenotypes commonly associated with infection by Wolbachia. Third, sex ratio is a trait with a heritable component in this species; thus, it can evolve under selection. Fourth, the sex ratio produced by uninfected (cured) females changes over time, approaching the sex ratio produced by females from the infected culture. On the basis of these results, we suggest that after sex ratio manipulation by Wolbachia, a host compensatory mechanism evolved that allows infected females to produce the sex ratio favored by nuclear genes. We discuss the evolution of "mutualism" with respect to the evolution of host mechanisms that compensate for effects induced by vertically transmitted "parasites."

TI Mutualistic asexual endophytes in a native grass are usually parasitic
AB Asexual systemic fungi that live symbiotically within grasses are viewed as strong mutualists on the basis of theory and empirical studies of introduced agronomic grasses. Evolutionary theory predicts that microbial symbionts that lose sexuality and rely on propagules of their hosts for transmission should evolve to benefit their hosts. Fungal endophytes of some cultivated turf and pasture grasses are well known for increasing plant performance and competitive abilities, especially under stress, and increasing resistance to herbivores, pathogens, and root-feeders by virtue of fungal alkaloids. The assumption of mutualism, however, has rarely been tested in native grasses, which often harbor high but variable frequencies of systemic asexual endophytes. We tested the effect of Neotyphodium infections for the native grass Arizona fescue in a 3-yr field experiment. We strictly controlled host genotype and manipulated soil moisture and nutrients. Infection generally decreased host growth in terms of plant volume, number of tillers, and dry mass of shoots and roots. Infected plants also showed decreased reproduction in terms of number and mass of seeds, and the seeds produced by infected plants had lower germination success than plants without their endophytes, suggesting that the negative effects of the symbiont are transferred to the next generation. Plant genotype strongly influenced host's growth and reproduction and interacted with the presence of the endophyte, but the interaction was usually in the direction of negative effects. Our results challenge the notion that systemic asexual endophytes must be plant mutualists for infections to persist in nature. We propose other hypotheses to explain the variable but usually high endophyte frequencies in natural populations of grasses.

TI Trophically transmitted parasites and the conservation of small
   populations: Raccoon roundworm and the imperiled allegheny woodrat
AB Disease threats to endangered species are most commonly caused by exotic microparasites accidentally introduced into naive populations by humans. The case of raccoon roundworm ( Baylisascaris procyonis ) and the Allegheny woodrat ( Neotoma magister ) is an exception to this general rule and, as such, may be useful in the identification of other macroparasite disease threats in the future. B. procyonis is an intestinal nematode of raccoons ( Procyon lotor ) that is highly pathogenic in intermediate hosts. It is hypothesized to have caused or contributed to the extirpation of the Allegheny woodrat from the northern parts of its range. I tested this hypothesis by reintroducing Allegheny woodrats into four historically occupied sites with varying natural levels of environmental contamination with B. procyonis eggs. Populations were monitored via radiotelemetry and trapping for 22 months. Woodrat populations in less contaminated release sites survived significantly longer than populations in highly contaminated sites, and there was a strong negative correlation between the number of raccoon latrines and woodrat population persistence. This case demonstrates several points relevant to the conservation of small populations: trophically transmitted parasites ( in which prey species serve as intermediate hosts to the parasites of their predators ) can be significant sources of mortality in intermediate host populations; native parasites should not be ignored as potential disease threats; and parasites of human-adapted wild animals are likely to threaten rare and endangered species. This case also illustrates a previously unrecognized route through which host density can be decoupled from disease dynamics and provides evidence of apparent competition in nature.

TI Effect of forest fragmentation on Lyme disease risk
AB Forest destruction and fragmentation in the United States recently have been shown to reduce mammalian species diversity and to elevate population densities of white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ). One potential consequence of reduced species diversity and high mouse density in small fragments is an increase in human exposure to Lyme disease. Increased risk of exposure to this disease is expected because of the role of the white-footed mouse as the principal natural reservoir of the Lyme bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi . Blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) feeding on mice have a higher probability of becoming infected with the bacterium than do ticks feeding on any other host species. We hypothesized that small forest patches ( <2 ha ) have a higher density of infected nymphal blacklegged ticks, which is the primary risk factor for Lyme disease, than larger patches ( 2-8 ha ). In the summer of 2000, we sampled tick density and B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in 14 maple-dominated forest patches, ranging in size from 0.7 to 7.6 ha, in Dutchess County of southeastern New York state. We found a significant linear decline in nymphal infection prevalence with increasing patch area and a significant exponential decline in nymphal density with increasing patch area. The consequence was a dramatic increase in the density of infected nymphs, and therefore in Lyme disease risk, with decreasing forest patch size. We did not observe a similar relationship between the density of larval ticks and patch size. These results suggest that by influencing the community composition of vertebrate hosts for disease-bearing vectors, habitat fragmentation can influence human health.

TI Overwinter survival of Rana lessonae and its hemiclonal associate Rana
   esculenta
AB In central Europe, the hybridogenetic water frog Rana esculenta is a sexual parasite that only persists in the presence of the parental species, R. lessonae, with which it must mate in order to reproduce. R. esculenta is a superior larval competitor, and adult females are about three times more fecund than R. lessonae. This suggests that, in the absence of some balancing advantage to R. lessonae, R. esculenta should drive the parental species locally extinct, closely followed by itself. We measured annual survival rates over six years at two widely separated ponds using modern capture-mark-recaoture methods to test whether differences in adult survival might contribute to the persistence of the water frog system. We marked 856 adult frogs and recovered 182 at least once. The data did not deviate significantly from the assumptions of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model at either pond. There were no detectable differences in recapture probabilities between taxa, but females were, overall, less likely to be recaptured. Survival was higher for R. esculenta in all but one year. Therefore, some mechanism other than adult survival must be invoked to explain the persistence of this unusual breeding system. There was considerable year-to-year variation in survival, ranging from 6% over the winter of 1996-1997, to 98% over the winter of 1995-1996. Although the two ponds are separated by 35 km, pond identity did not contribute to the minimum models. A composite measure of winter severity constructed from a principal components analysis of weather data during the course of the study had a very close relationship with survival (R. lessonae, r = 0.905; R. esculenta, r = 0.889). Survival was lowest in winters with low minimum temperatures coupled with high and variable. maximum temperatures.

TI Resistance to a fungal pathogen and host plant specialization in the pea
   aphid
AB Herbivores that show host race formation on different plant species have proven to be valuable model systems for studying the evolution of specialization and speciation. Here, we use the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum , to investigate a possible link between specialization on two host plant species, Lotus uliginosus and Trifolium pratense , and resistance to a natural enemy, the fungal pathogen Erynia neoaphidis . Pea aphids collected on either plant species in the field showed in most cases poor survival on the alternate host plant. Furthermore, pea aphids specialized on T. pratense were very resistant to E. neoaphidis , whereas aphids specialized on L. uliginosus were susceptible. This susceptibility was not influenced by the actual food plant on which the assays were conducted. We discuss how selection from natural enemies may influence the process of specialization and race formation, and how specialization can affect the evolution of resistance.

   populations on the southern tablelands of New South Wales, Australia.
   II. Selection of a strain of virus for release
AB To be able to study the dynamics of myxoma virus spread following a release in the field, a strain of virus is required that is both highly transmissible and readily differentiated from other field strains. Eight strains of virus of known virulence for laboratory rabbits and with previously mapped and sequenced restriction fragment length polymorphisms, were used to infect groups of seronegative wild rabbits. Based on these trials, and on the nature of the DNA polymorphism, a virus designated Brooklands/2-93 was chosen as a strain suitable for experimental release. These trials confirmed that resistance to myxomatosis within wild rabbit populations continues to be substantial and that some rabbits are highly resistant. These rabbits probably have little role in transmission of virus. Most of the virus strains tested induced very small or invisible primary lesions at the inoculation site. Thus the secondary skin sites such as eyelids, face and ears may be critical for transmission.

AB An identifiable strain of myxoma virus was introduced into four local populations of wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus on the southern tablelands of New South Wales (NSW) and its spread in the presence of other field strains was monitored for 6 months. The main vector in this region was considered to be the European rabbit flea Spilopsyllis cuniculi. Each population of rabbits was of a high density and living in groups of warrens covering areas from 59 to 87 hectares. Rabbits occupying centrally located warrens were inoculated with the virus in late September or early October (spring) and the subsequent appearance of myxomatosis across the sites monitored by trapping, shooting and visual observations. Samples, taken from rabbits with myxomatosis, were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that allowed identification of the introduced strain. On all four sites the introduced virus spread from the inoculated rabbits in the centrally located warrens to rabbits in surrounding warrens. On Sites I and 3, this spread continued across the entire site persisting for at least 118 and 174 days respectively. On Sites 2 and 4, the virus was detected for 78 and 62 days respectively and the subsequent inability to detect the introduced virus correlated with the appearance of an unrelated field strain. Using three different methods of calculation, rates of spread ranged from 3.7 to 17.8 in d(-1).

TI Parasite-mediated selection in experimental Daphnia magna populations
AB It has been suggested that parasites are a strong selecting force for their hosts and therefore may alter the outcome of competition among host genotypes. We tested the extent to which parasite-mediated selection by different parasite species influenced competition among clones of the cyclic parthenogen Daphnia magna. We monitored clone frequency changes in laboratory microcosm populations consisting of 21 D. magna clones. Parasite treatments (two microsporidians, Glugoides intestinalis and Ordospora colligata) and a parasite-free control treatment were followed over a nine-month period. A further treatment with the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa failed. We found significant differences in clonal success among the treatments: the two parasite treatments differed from the control treatment and from each other. Additionally, we measured the clone-specific population carrying capacity, competitive ability against tester clones, and reproductive success of infected and uninfected females to test whether they correlate with clonal success in the microcosms. The clone-specific competitive ability was a good predictor of clonal success in the microcosms, but clonal carrying capacity and host reproductive success were not. Our study shows that parasite-mediated selection can strongly alter the outcome of clonal competition. The results suggest that parasites may influence microevolution in Daphnia populations during periods of asexual reproduction.

TI Host-dependent genetic structure of parasite populations: Differential
   dispersal of seabird tick host races
AB Despite the fact that parasite dispersal is likely to be one of the most important processes influencing the dynamics and coevolution of host-parasite interactions, little information is available on the factors that affect it. In most cases, opportunities for parasite dispersal should be closely linked to host biology. Here we use microsatellite genetic markers to compare the population structure and dispersal of two host races of the seabird tick Ixodes uriae at the scale of the North Atlantic. Interestingly, tick populations showed high within-population genetic variation and relatively low population differentiation. However, gene flow at different spatial scales seemed to depend on the host species exploited. The black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) had structured tick populations showing patterns of isolation by distance, whereas tick populations of the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) were only weakly structured at the largest scale considered. Host-dependent rates of tick dispersal between colonies will alter infestation probabilities and local dynamics and may thus modify the adaptation potential of ticks to local hosts. Moreover, as l. uriae is a vector of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in both hemispheres, the large-scale movements of birds and the subsequent dispersal of ticks will have important consequences for the dynamics and coevolutionary interactions of this microparasite with its different vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.

AB Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection is very prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, but the role of sexual transmission has not been well characterized. HHV-8 seroprevalence and correlates were evaluated in a cohort of female prostitutes in Mombasa, Kenya. Between February 1993 and January 2000, stored plasma samples taken from 736 women were tested, by whole-virus ELISA assay, for the presence of HHV-8 antibodies; of these 736 women, 633 were included in the analysis of correlates of HHV-8 infection; and, of these 633, 44.1% were seropositive for HHV-8 antibodies. In univariate analysis, age, years of education, years of prostitution, workplace, hormonal contraception, intrauterine-device use, alcohol consumption, syphilis, and gonorrhea were all significantly associated with the presence of HHV-8 antibodies. In a multivariate model, older age, fewer years of education, and 2 markers of high-risk sexual behavior-namely, alcohol consumption and gonorrhea-were each independently associated with HHV-8 seropositivity. These results suggest that heterosexual transmission may contribute to acquisition of HHV-8 infections in this African population of prostitutes.

   tristeza virus populations from eastern Spain
AB Genetic variation in natural populations of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was studied using haplotypes detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of two genomic regions (p20 gene and segment A , located in ORF1a). Analysis of 254 samples from 125 trees, collected at 12 different sites, yielded 8 different haplotypes for p20 and 5 for segment A . The most frequent haplotype of p20 was predominant at all sites, but several sites differed in the predominance of segment A haplotypes. At most sites, the homozygosity observed for the p20 gene tended to be higher than expected in a neutral evolution, whereas the opposite was true for segment A . Comparison of the populations at different sites showed that 44 of the 66 possible population pairs were genetically distinct for segment A , but only six pairs differed for the p20 gene. Analysis of molecular variance grouping trees by site, scion variety, rootstock or age, showed that variation in segment A was significantly affected by site, tree age and rootstock, and that variation between trees in each group and within trees was even more important. In contrast, variation in p20 was affected only by site and rootstock, each factor contributing to <2% of the variation. The data suggest that sequence variations in segment A must be functionally less important and that it has less evolutionary constraints than p20 . Detection of different haplotypes in neighbour trees or in samples from the same tree may help explain part of the variability observed in CTV symptom expression.

TI Top-down or bottom-up regulation of intra-host blood-stage malaria: do
   malaria parasites most resemble the dynamics of prey or predator?
AB Knowledge of the factors that limit parasite numbers offers hope of improved intervention strategies as well as exposing the selective forces that have shaped parasite life-history strategies. We develop a theoretical framework with which to consider the intra-host regulation of malaria parasite density. We analyse a general model that relates timing and magnitude of peak parasite density to initial dose under three different regulatory processes. The dynamics can be regulated either by top-down processes (upgradable immune regulation), bottom-up processes (fixed immune response and red blood cell (RBC) limitation) or a mixture of the two. We define and estimate the following key parameters: (i) the rate of RBC replenishment; (ii) the rate of destruction of uninfected RBCs; and (iii) the maximum parasite growth rate. Comparing predictions of this model with experimental results for rodent malaria in laboratory mice allowed us to reject functional forms of immune upregulation and/or effects of RBC limitation that were inconsistent with the data. Bottom-up regulation alone was insufficient to account for observed patterns without invoking either localized depletion of RBC density or merozoite interference. By contrast, an immune function upregulated in proportion to either merozoite or infected RBC density was consistent with observed dynamics. An immune response directed solely at merozoites required twice the level of activation of one directed at infected RBCs.

TI Survival of Streptococcus pyogenes within host phagocytic cells: A
   pathogenic mechanism for persistence and systemic invasion
AB Streptococcus pyogenes is generally an extracellular pathogen that can survive and persist within the host by circumventing the host defense mechanisms. To achieve this, S. pyogenes has developed a number of strategies to circumvent the host immune system (e.g., virulence factors directed to prevent phagocytosis). By use of a murine model of skin infection, it was shown that survival within host phagocytic cells constitutes an additional strategy used by S. pyogenes to evade the host defenses and disseminate. Viable microorganisms were isolated from mouse phagocytic cells after in vitro or during in vivo infection. The capacity of intracellularly located bacteria to establish infection was demonstrated by the efficiency of gentamicin-treated neutrophils isolated from infected mice to transfer infection when injected intravenously into naive mice. The ability of S. pyogenes to exploit the inflammatory response of the host by surviving inside phagocytic cells may constitute an additional virulence mechanism of this pathogen.

TI Intrahost sequence variation in the streptococcal inhibitor of
   complement gene in patients with human pharyngitis
AB Selection of new variants of the streptococcal inhibitor of complement protein has been implicated in the perpetuation of epidemics caused by serotype M1 strains of group A Streptococcus (GAS). The frequency at which new streptococcal inhibitor of complement (Sic) variants arise in an infected individual is not known. To study this issue, the sic gene was sequenced in 100 isolates cultured from throat swabs of each of 20 patients with acute pharyngitis caused by serotype M1 GAS. Five patients were infected with GAS populations expressing 2 Sic variants characterized by deletion of a region of the protein. In contrast, no intrahost variation was detected in the number of a pentanucleotide repeat (CAAAA) that controls production of a bacterial cell-surface collagen-like protein by slipped-strand mispairing. Sic variation occurs at a sufficient frequency in vivo to result in mixed infections on the mucosal surface of human hosts, potentially contributing to pathogen survival.

The present study estimated the frequency of transmission of drug-resistant HIV from patients receiving antiretroviral therapy using retrospective surveys of clinic data.

TI A comparative study of white blood cell counts and disease risk in
   carnivores
AB In primates, baseline levels of white blood cell (WBC) counts are related to mating promiscuity. It was hypothesized that differences in the primate immune system reflect pathogen risks from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Here, we test for the generality of this result by examining hypotheses involving behavioural, ecological and life-history factors in carnivores. Again, we find a significant correlation in carnivores between mating promiscuity and elevated levels of WBC counts. In addition, we find relationships with measures of sociality, substrate use and life-history parameters. These comparative results across independent taxonomic orders indicate that the evolution of the immune system, as represented by phylogenetic differences in basal levels of blood cell counts, is closely linked to disease risk involved with promiscuous mating and associated variables. We found only limited support for an association between the percentage of meat in the diet and WBC counts, which is consistent with the behavioural and physiological mechanisms that carnivores use to avoid parasite transmission from their prey. We discuss additional comparative questions related to taxonomic differences in disease risk, modes of parasite transmission and implications for conservation biology.

TI Community genetics: Expanding the synthesis of ecology and genetics
AB Community genetics synthesizes community ecology and population genetics and yields fresh insights into the interplay between evolutionary and ecological processes. A community genetics framework proves especially valuable when strong selection on traits results from or impinges on interspecific interactions, an increasingly common phenomenon as more communities are subject to direct management or anthropogenic disturbances. We draw illustrations of this perspective from our ongoing studies of three representative communities, two managed and one natural, that have recently undergone large perturbations. The studied communities are: (1) insect pests of crop plants genetically engineered to produce insecticidal toxins; (2) insect-pollinated plants in habitats severely fragmented by agriculture and urbanization; and (3) a pathogen and its crop host now grown extensively outside their native ranges. We demonstrate the value of integrating genetic and ecological processes to gain a full understanding of community dynamics, particularly in nonequilibrium systems that are subject to strong selection.

TI Parasite evolution and extinctions
AB We examine the evolution of diseases that show the frequency-dependent transmission process that is commonly applied to sexually and vector-transmitted infections. As is commonly found, the basic reproductive ratio (R-0) of the parasite is maximized by evolution. This has important implications, as it implies that for a wide range of circumstances diseases that show frequency-dependent transmission may be selected to evolve towards driving their hosts to extinction. This contrasts with the results obtained in spatially explicit models where although parasite-driven host extinction may occur, it is unlikely to evolve. We further show that an evolutionary constraint between transmission and virulence is required for evolution to lead to an endemic coexistence of both the host and the disease. Furthermore, this constraint needs to be saturating, such that transmission is 'bought' at an increasing cost in terms of virulence, to avoid evolution to extinction.

AB To evaluate transmission dynamics, we exposed 25 bird species to West Nile virus (WNV) by infectious mosquito bite. We monitored viremia titers, clinical outcome, WNV shedding (cloacal and oral), seroconversion, virus persistence in organs, and susceptibility to oral and contact transmission. Passeriform and charadriiform birds were more reservoir competent (a derivation of viremia data) than other species tested. The five most competent species were passerines: Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata), Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), and House Sparrow (Passer domesticus). Death occurred in eight species. Cloacal shedding of WNV was observed in 17 of 24 species, and oral shedding in 12 of 14 species. We observed contact transmission among four species and oral in five species. Persistent WNV infections were found in tissues of 16 surviving birds. Our observations shed light on transmission ecology of WNV and will benefit surveillance and control programs.

TI Island and taxon effects in parasitism revisited: Avian malaria in the
   Lesser Antilles
AB We identify and describe the distribution of 12 genetically distinct malaria parasite lineages over islands and hosts in four common passerine birds in the Lesser Antilles. Combined parasite prevalence demonstrates strong host effects, little or no island effect, and a significant host-times-island interaction, indicating independent outcomes of host-parasite infections among island populations of the same host species. Host- and/or island-specific parasite lineages do not explain these host-parasite associations; rather, individual lineages themselves demonstrate the same type of independent interactions. Unlike overall prevalence, individual parasite lineages show considerable geographic structure (i.e., island effects) as well as species effects indicating that parasite lineages are constrained in their ability to move between hosts and locations. Together, our results suggest an upper limit to the number of host individuals that malaria parasites, as a community, can infect. Within this limit, however, the relative frequency of the different lineages varies reflecting fine scale interactions between host and parasite populations. Patterns of host-parasite associations within this system suggest both historical co-evolution and ecologically dynamic and independent host-parasite interactions.

TI Rodents, cowpox virus and islands: densities, numbers and thresholds
AB 1. The population dynamics of bank voles and wood mice, and of cowpox virus infection in these two species, was studied over a 2-year period in a mainland population and in 14 nearby island populations of varying sizes.
   2. For both species, there was no intrinsic variation in the pattern of host dynamics with island size: small island populations behaved as though they were small subsamples of a larger population, displaying no more than the expected random variation from the general pattern.
   3. None the less, the relative numbers of bank voles to wood mice increased markedly with decreasing island size; and bank vole densities tended to be higher on smaller islands.
   4. Only 22 animals were discovered to have moved either between islands or between the mainland and the islands, out of 1883 captured in all. None the less, it was apparent that males were more likely to move than females.
   5. Overall patterns of cowpox virus dynamics were similar in all cases. However, on all islands there were extended periods when cowpox virus infection was apparently absent, and on the small islands the numbers of infected individuals were mostly very low and in many cases infection was never found.
   6. For both host species, there was no evidence for a threshold population size for cowpox virus (critical community size) in terms of density, but clear evidence for one in terms of the numerical size of populations. This suggests little support for density-dependent transmission, despite this having been the usual default assumption for non-sexually transmitted infections.
   7. There was also evidence for a separate invasion threshold (between ecological and epidemiological invasion) and persistence threshold (between epidemiological invasion and persistence). This is contrary to the output of the most-quoted (deterministic) models - persistence and invasion threshold one and the same - highlighting the fact that little attention has been paid in the past to the practical meaning of the theoretical concept of a threshold.
   8. In the case of the wood mice, a superficial similarity to the bank vole thresholds was potentially misleading. Wood mouse thresholds were influenced at least as much by the bank vole thresholds as they were by the dynamics within the wood mouse populations themselves.

TI Multiple parasites are driving major histocompatibility complex
   polymorphism in the wild
AB Parasite mediated selection may result in arms races between host defence and parasite virulence. In particular, simultaneous infections from multiple parasite species should cause diversification (i.e. balancing selection) in resistance genes both at the population and the individual level. Here, we tested these ideas in highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes from three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.). In eight natural populations, parasite diversity (15 different species), and MHC class IIB diversity varied strongly between habitat types (lakes vs. rivers vs. estuaries) with lowest values in rivers. Partial correlation analysis revealed an influence of parasite diversity on MHC class IIB variation whereas general genetic diversity assessed at seven microsatellite loci was not significantly correlated with parasite diversity. Within individual fish, intermediate, rather than maximal allele numbers were associated with minimal parasite load, supporting theoretical models of self-reactive T-cell elimination. The optimal individual diversity matched those values female fish try to achieve in their offspring by mate choice. We thus present correlative evidence supporting the 'allele counting' strategy for optimizing the immunocompetence in stickleback offspring.

TI The de novo selection of drug-resistant malaria parasites
AB Antimalarial drug resistance emerges de novo predominantly in areas of low malaria transmission. Because of the logarithmic distribution of parasite numbers in human malaria infections, inadequately treated high biomass infections are a major source of de novo antimalarial resistance, whereas use of antimalarial prophylaxis provides a low resistance selection risk. Slowly eliminated antimalarials encourage resistance largely by providing a selective filter for resistant parasites acquired from others, and not by selecting resistance de novo. The de novo emergence of resistance can be prevented by use of antimalarial combinations. Artemisinin derivative combinations are particularly effective. Ensuring adequate treatment of the relatively few heavily infected patients would slow the emergence of resistance.

TI Effects of Microphallus papillorobustus (Platyhelminthes : Trematoda) on
   serotonergic immunoreactivity and neuronal architecture in the brain of
   Gammarus insensibilis (Crustacea : Amphipoda)
AB The larval flatworm Microphallus papillorobustus encysts in the protocerebrum of its intermediate host, Gammarus insensibilis, and changes the gammarid's responses to mechanical and photic stimuli. The resulting aberrant escape behaviour renders infected gammarids more susceptible to predation by birds, the definitive hosts of the parasite. We used immunocytochemical methods to explore the mechanisms underlying these subtle behavioural modifications. Whole mounts of gammarid brains were labelled with fluorescent anti-serotonin and anti-synapsin antibodies and viewed using confocal microscopy. Two types of change were observed in infected brains: the intensity of the serotonergic label was altered in specific regions of the brain, and the architecture of some serotonergic tracts and neurons was affected. A morphometric analysis of the distribution of the label showed that serotonergic immunoreactivity was decreased significantly (by 62%) in the optic neuropils, but not in the olfactory lobes, in the presence of the parasite. In addition, the optic tracts and the tritocerebral giant neurons were stunted in parasitized individuals. Published evidence demonstrates changes in serotonin levels in hosts ranging from crustaceans to mammals infected by parasites as diverse as protozoans and helminths. The present study suggests that the degeneration of discrete sets of serotonergic neurons might underlie the serotonergic imbalance and thus contribute to host manipulation.

TI Regulation of the rate of asexual growth and commitment to sexual
   development by diffusible factors from in vitro cultures of Plasmodium
   falciparum
AB The mechanism of switching to sexual differentiation (gametocytogenesis) of Plasmodium falciparum appears to be controlled by stochastic mechanisms that are sensitive to environmental conditions. In any given conditions, only a proportion of genetically identical parasites will become committed to sexual development. We used an experimental co-culture system to detect the presence of diffusible molecules from asexually replicating bloodstream stages of P. falciparum that were capable of influencing the growth and differentiation of the parasite. We cultured two populations of P. falciparum in a shared environment separated by a membrane that allowed free diffusion of molecules. The data presented show that P. falciparum parasites in culture stimulate their own growth and replication, and constitutively inhibit sexual conversion via diffusible molecules. These observations support the model that for P. falciparum, the sexual pathway of development is the default, and that constitutive repression of the sexual pathway permits asexual multiplication to occur in the bloodstream of the human host.

Complete profiles were obtained for less than or equal to 2 days after blood ingestion. Eighteen percent of the meals came from two different people. There was no evidence of meals from greater than or equal to 2 people. Eighty percent of the meal sources were identified, > 70% were taken from residents of the collection house, and > 90% were from residents of the study community. Across the community, feeding was non-random with a bias towards young adults and males. Three people accounted for 56% of the meals. Our results confirm that multiple feeding on different people is an important component in the role of Ae. aegypti in dengue virus transmission and help explain the spatial distribution of dengue cases in a previous epidemic in Florida, Puerto Rico.

TI Transmission of eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus in Central
   Alabama
AB A site near Tuskegee, Alabama was examined for vector activity of eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus in 2001. More than 23,000 mosquitoes representing 8 genera and 34 species were collected during a 21-week period, and five species, Culiseta melanura, Aedes vexans, Coquillettidia perturbans, Culex erraticus, and Uranotaenia sapphirina, were examined for the presence of virus using a nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for EEE virus. Each species was infected at various times of the mosquito season (May-September) with different minimum infection rates (MIRs). Culiseta melanura had the highest MIR (20.2) and positive pools were detected from late May to mid-September. Aedes vexans had an MIR of 2.2 and was infected early in the season (June), while Cq. perturbans exhibited a much higher field infection rate (9.9) with all positive pools collected in August. Culiseta melanura is a likely endemic vector in central Alabama, while Ae. vexans and Cq. perturbans probably function as bridge vectors. Culex erraticus, the most common mosquito in the habitat (54% of total collections), had an MIR of 3.2, and was persistently infected from mid-June to mid-September. This is the first report of high rates of EEE virus infection in this species, a member of the tropical subgenus Melanoconion. Uranotaenia sapphirina, considered to feed on amphibians and possibly reptiles, had an MIR of 5.6, with positive pools spanning a four-month period. This suggests that species other than birds may serve as a reservoir for EEE in hardwood swamps in the Southeastern United States and elsewhere. The lengthy period of mosquito infection with EEE virus, coupled with the diverse habits of the vectors and their proximity to a population center, indicate the importance of monitoring EEE virus activity in the Mid-South.

Seropositivity for HHV-8 tended to decrease with age (P < 0.001) and was not associated with exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HCV.

This suggests very early acquisition of infection with HHV-8 in Cambodia.

TI Molecular control points in rhizosphere food webs
AB Plant roots play diverse roles in the rhizosphere. They function as organs responsible for structural support, for acquisition of mineral and water resources, and for fostering of symbiotic bacteria and fungi. They also sustain a complex food web of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in, on, and near the root. In addition to these well-known functions, roots have a recently discovered role with potentially profound coevolutionary implications for the rhizosphere food web, as well as for terrestrial ecological communities in general. Roots are both a source and a receptor of molecular signals important for mutualistic bacteria and perhaps other soil organisms. Fluid-borne rhizosphere compounds flow in the opposite direction from airborne signals that emanate from plant shoots. The powerful transpiration stream around roots naturally concentrates molecular data in a cafeteria of information about the surrounding soil. These molecular signals, such as N-acylated homoserine lactones and phenazines produced by bacteria, can be interpreted simultaneously by multiple species as well as by the root. We propose a model of multitrophic molecular signals in the rhizosphere that implies multiple roles of roots, as hosts, regulators, and sustainers of terrestrial productivity. We suggest a framework of regulation in the rhizosphere that functions through molecular "control points." We define control points as regulatory elements that are operated on by selection processes to confer fitness on individual organisms and thereby have effects that propagate through other trophic levels. Identification of a control point creates a hypothesis that can be tested to assess the quantitative significance of that regulatory element. Some control points may transmit or perceive signals between organisms, but others probably integrate changing environmental conditions or external resources into individual life histories and community functions. The promise of understanding the new molecular signals is that genes must closely underlie these control points. This could offer ecology access to the power of molecular biology and allow a deep understanding of the evolutionary significance of these phenomena. One major strength of rhizospheres for addressing these issues is that realistic ecological interactions can be examined in a restricted microcosm under environmentally controlled conditions with organisms whose genomes have been completely defined and/or partially modified.

TI Cooperation in the rhizosphere and the "free rider" problem
AB Rhizobial bacteria, endomycorrhizal fungi (also known as arbuscular mycorrhizas), and pseudomonad bacteria associated with plant roots can provide substantial benefits to the plants by fixing nitrogen, supplying phosphorus, or controlling root pathogens, respectively. A significant fraction of plant photosynthetic carbon may be used by these associated microorganisms, both to support their beneficial activities and for microbial growth and reproduction. Because many microbial individuals are associated with each individual plant, the individual benefit to a microbe that allocates more resources to its own reproduction (thereby allocating less to fixing N-2, supplying P, or producing antifungal metabolites) would exceed its individual loss from any resulting reduction in collective benefits (mainly plant carbon substrates). An initially rare "free rider" mutant strain might therefore be expected to displace its more cooperative parental strain. Yet, the mycorrhizal and legume-rhizobium mutualisms have persisted (often coexisting with "cheating") for millions of years. This paper discusses the importance of microbial cooperation (with plants and with other microbes) and possible reasons for its evolutionary persistence in the rhizosphere. In undisturbed soils, spatial structure can favor kin selection, but this may be counterbalanced by the increased likelihood that future competitors will be among the beneficiaries of current cooperation. In loose associations, direct fitness benefits to microorganisms may explain the evolutionary persistence of activities (e.g., production of antifungal compounds) that can benefit plants as a side effect. In closer, more symbiotic, relationships, host sanctions against individuals or clones that fail to perform their symbiotic function may be more important. New molecular methods and other research tools are facilitating research on this topic, and some of these conclusions soon may be revised.

TI Host mortality, predation and the evolution of parasite virulence
AB One of the most accepted views in the theoretical literature on virulence evolution is that a parasite's virulence will evolve to higher levels when its host's background mortality rate increases. Surprisingly, however, although many sources of background mortality involve predation, there has not yet been any theoretical research that explicitly considers how the dynamics of this important ecological interaction affects virulence evolution. Here, we consider how predation affects virulence evolution by explicitly introducing a predator into a classical susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemiological model. We find that, contrary to previous predictions, different sources of host mortality affect virulence evolution in different ways. Moreover, the way in which virulence evolution is affected depends on how tightly coupled the predator's dynamics are to the host population, and this can result in somewhat counterintuitive results. For example, indirect ecological effects can cause elevated host mortality to result in the evolution of lower parasite virulence, even if this elevated mortality arises from factors unrelated to predation.

Exposure to various risk factors during the period relevant to the incubation period of HBV was recorded both from cases and controls using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data showed that cases were more likely to have received one injection (OR = 4(.)0; 95 % CI 1(.)4, 11(.)1), or more than one injection (OR= 6(.)3; 95% CI 3(.)2, 12(.)4) compared to controls. The estimated population attributable risk (PAR) for therapeutic injections was 53 %. Also the cases compared to controls were more likely to have household size of seven or more (OR= 1(.)9; 95 % CI 0(.)95, 3(.)9). This study showed that unsafe therapeutic injections appear to be the major risk factor for acute HBV infection and needs immediate focus from public health stand point.

TI Gene flow and the coevolution of parasite range
AB The geographic range of many parasites is restricted relative to that of their hosts. We study possible evolutionary mechanisms for this observation using a simple model that couples coevolution and demography. The model assumes that the environment consists of two habitats connected by movement and that coevolution is governed by quantitative traits. Our results demonstrate that host gene flow is an important determinant of parasite geographic range. Fluctuations in the rate of host gene flow cause shifts in parasite population densities and associated range expansions or contractions. In extreme cases, changing the rate of host gene flow can lead to global extinction of the parasite. Through a process we term demographic compensation, these shifts in parasite density may occur with little or no change in parasite adaptation to the host. As a consequence, reciprocal adaptation between host and parasite can become uncoupled from the rate of host gene flow.

TI The evolution of virulence in a plant virus
AB The evolution of virulence is a rapidly growing field of research, but few reports deal with the evolution of virulence in natural populations of parasites. We present here an observational and experimental analysis of the evolution of virulence of the plant virus Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) during an epidemic on tomato in eastern Spain. Three types of CMV isolates were found that caused in tomato plants either a systemic necrosis (N isolates), stunting and a severe reduction of leaf lamina (Y isolates), or stunting and leaf curl (A isolates). These phenotypes were due to the presence of satellite RNAs (satRNAs) necrogenic (in N isolates) or attenuative (in A isolates) of the symptoms caused by CMV without satRNA (Y isolates). For these three types of isolates, parameters of virulence and transmission were estimated experimentally. For virulence the ranking of isolates was N > Y > A, for transmissibility, Y > A > N. The predictions of theoretical models for the evolution of virulence were analyzed with these parameters and compared with observations from the field. A single-infection model predicted adequately the observed long-term evolution of the CMV population to intermediate levels of virulence. A coinfection model that considered competition between isolates with an effect on transmission explained the invasion of the CMV population by N isolates at the beginning of the epidemic, and its predictions also agreed with field data on the long-term evolution of the CMV population. An important conclusion from both models was that the density of the aphid vector's population is a major factor in the evolution of CMV virulence. This may be relevant for the design of control strategies for CMV-induced diseases.

TI Test of synergistic interaction between infection and inbreeding in
   Daphnia magna
AB It has been proposed that parasitic infections increase selection against inbred genotypes. We tested this hypothesis experimentally using pairs of selfed and outcrossed sibling lines of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia Magna, which can be maintained clonally. We studied the performance of selfed relative to outcrossed sibling clones during repeated pairwise clonal competition in the presence and absence of two species of microsporidian parasites. In 13 of the 14 pairs, the selfed clones did worse than the outcrossed ones in the control treatment, but the presence of either parasite did not result in an overall increase in this difference. Rather, it decreased the performance of the selfed relative to the outcrossed sibling in some pairs and increased it in others. Moreover, the two parasite species did not have the same effect in a given pair. This indicates that, contrary to the hypothesis that parasites generally lead to a decreased performance of inbred genotypes, their effect may depend on the genetic background of the host as well as on the parasite species, and suggests that inbreeding can lead to reduced or increased resistance to parasites. Our findings also indicate that there is variation for specific resistance to different species of parasites in the metapopulation from which the hosts for this study were obtained.

TI Evidence for strong host clone-parasite species interactions in the
   Daphnia microparasite system
AB Organisms are often confronted with multiple enemy species. Defenses against different parasite species may be traded off against each other. However, if resistance is based on (potentially costly) general defense mechanisms, it may be positively correlated among parasites. In an experimental study, we confronted 19 clones from one Daphnia magna population with two bacterial and three microsporidian parasite species. All parasites were isolated from the same pond as the hosts. Host clones were specific in their susceptibility towards different parasite species, and parasite species were host-clone specific in their infectivity, spore production, and virulence, resulting in highly significant host-parasite interactions. Since the Daphnia's resistance to different parasite species showed no obvious correlation, neither general defense mechanisms nor trade-offs in resistance explain our findings. None of the Daphnia clones were resistant to all parasite species, and the average level of resistance was quite similar among clones. This may reflect a cost of defense, so that the cumulative cost of being resistant to all parasite species might be too high.

TI The evolution of immune defense and song complexity in birds
AB There are three main hypotheses that explain how the evolution of parasite virulence could be linked to the evolution of secondary sexual traits, such as bird song. First, as Hamilton and Zuk proposed a role for parasites in sexual selection, female preference for healthy males in heavily parasitized species may result in extravagant trait expression. Second, a reverse causal mechanism may act, if sexual selection affects the coevolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions per se by selecting for increased virulence. Third, the immuno-suppressive effects of ornamentation by testosterone or limited resources may lead to increased susceptibility to parasites in species with elaborate songs. Assuming a coevolutionary relationship between parasite virulence and host investment in immune defense we used measures of immune function and song complexity to test these hypotheses in a comparative study of passerine birds. Under the first two hypotheses we predicted avian song complexity to be positively related to immune defense among species, whereas this relationship was expected to be negative if immuno-suppression was at work. We found that adult T-cell mediated immune response and the relative size of the bursa of Fabricius were independently positively correlated with a measure of song complexity, even when potentially confounding variables were held constant. Nestling T-cell response was not related to song complexity, probably reflecting age-dependent selective pressures on host immune defense. Our results are consistent with the hypotheses that predict a positive relationship between song complexity and immune function, thus indicating a role for parasites in sexual selection. Different components of the immune system may have been independently involved in this process.

TI Assessing risks for a pre-emergent pathogen: virginiamycin use and the
   emergence of streptogramin resistance in Enterococcus faecium
AB Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections and an emerging infectious disease. VRE infections were resistant to standard antibiotics until quinupristin/dalfopristin (QD), a streptogramin antibiotic, was approved in 1999 for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections in people. After that decision, the practice of using virginiamycin in agriculture for animal growth promotion came under intense scrutiny. Virginiamycin, another streptogramin, threatens the efficacy of QD in medicine because streptogramin resistance in enterococci associated with food animals may be transferred to E faecium in hospitalised patients. Policy makers face an unavoidable conundrum when assessing risks for pre-emergent pathogens; good policies that prevent or delay adverse outcomes may leave little evidence that they had an effect. To provide a sound basis for policy, we have reviewed the epidemiology of E faecium and streptogramin resistance and present qualitative results from mathematical models. These models are based on simple assumptions consistent with evidence, and they establish reasonable expectations about the population-genetic and population-dynamic processes underlying the emergence of streptogramin-resistant E faecium (SIREF). Using the model, we have identified critical aspects of SREF emergence. We conclude that the emergence of SREF is likely to be the result of an interaction between CID use in medicine and the long-term use of virginiamycin for animal growth promotion. Virginiamycin use has created a credible threat to the efficacy of QD by increasing the mobility and frequency of high-level resistance genes. The potential effects are greatest for intermediate rates of human-to-human transmission (R-0 approximate to 1).

TI Hierarchical spatial structure of genetically variable
   nucleopolyhedroviruses infecting cyclic populations of western tent
   caterpillars
AB The cyclic population dynamics of western tent caterpillars, Malacosoma californicum pluviale , are associated with epizootics of a nucleopolyhedrovirus, McplNPV. Given the dynamic fluctuations in host abundance and levels of viral infection, host resistance and virus virulence might be expected to change during different phases of the cycle. As a first step in determining if McplNPV virulence and population structure change with host density, we used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to examine the genetic diversity of McplNPV infecting western tent caterpillar populations at different spatial scales. Thirteen dominant genetic variants were identified in 39 virus isolates (individual larvae) collected from field populations during one year of low host density, and another distinct variant was discovered among nine additional isolates in two subsequent years of declining host density. The distribution of these genetic variants was not random and indicated that the McplNPV population was structured at several spatial levels. A high proportion of the variation could be explained by family grouping, which suggested that isolates collected within a family were more likely to be the same than isolates compared among populations. Additionally, virus variants from within populations (sites) were more likely to be the same than isolates collected from tent caterpillar populations on different islands. This may indicate that there is limited mixing of virus among tent caterpillar families and populations when host population density is low. Thus there is potential for the virus to become locally adapted to western tent caterpillar populations in different sites. However, no dominant genotype was observed at any site. Whether and how selection acts on the genetically diverse nucleopolyhedrovirus populations as host density changes will be investigated over the next cycle of tent caterpillar populations.

TI Identifying West Nile virus risk areas: The dynamic continuous-area
   space-time system
AB The Dynamic Continuous-Area Space-Time (DYCAST) system was developed to identify and prospectively monitor high-risk areas for West Nile virus in New York, New York (New York City). The system is based on a geographic model that uses a localized Knox test to capture the nonrandom space-time interaction of dead birds, as an indicator of an intense West Nile virus amplification cycle, within a 1.5-mile (2.41-km) buffer area and 21-day moving window. The Knox analysis is implemented as an interpolation function to create a surface of probabilities over a grid of 1,400 cells overlaying New York City. The model's parameters were calibrated using year 2000 data and information on the vector-host transmission cycle. The DYCAST system was implemented in a geographic information system and used operationally in year 2001. It successfully identified areas of high risk for human West Nile virus infection in areas where five of seven human cases resided, at least 13 days prior to the onset of illness, and proved that it can be used as an effective tool for targeting remediation and control efforts.

TI Efficiency of dengue serotype 2 virus strains to infect and disseminate
   in Aedes aegpti
AB Dengue serotype 2 (DEN-2) viruses with the potential to cause dengue hemorrhagic fever have been shown to belong to the Southeast (SE) Asian genotype. These viruses appear to be rapidly displacing the American genotype of DEN-2 in the Western Hemisphere. To determine whether distinct genotypes of DEN-2 virus are better adapted to mosquito transmission, we classified 15 viral strains of DEN-2 phylogenetically and compared their ability to infect and disseminate in different populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Envelope gene nuclecotide sequence analysis confirmed that six strains belonged to the American genotype and nine strains were of the SE Asian genotype. The coverall rate of disseminated infection in mosquitoes from Texas was 27% for the SE Asian genotype versus 9% for the American genotype. This pattern of infection was similar in another population of mosquitoes sampled from southern Mexico (30% versus 13%). Together, these findings suggest that Ae. aegypti tends to be more susceptible to infection by DEN-2 viruses of the SE Asian genotype than to those of the American genotype, and this may have epidemiologic implications.

TI A model for the coevolution of immunity and immune evasion in
   Vector-Borne diseases with implications for the epidemiology of malaria
AB We describe a model of host-parasite coevolution, where the interaction depends on the investments by the host in its immune response and by the parasite in its ability to suppress (or evade) its host's immune response. We base our model on the interaction between. malaria parasites and their mosquito hosts and thus describe the epidemiological dynamics with the Macdonald-Ross equation of malaria epidemiology. The qualitative predictions of the model are most sensitive to the cost of the immune response and to the intensity of transmission. If transmission is weak or the cost of immunity is low, the system evolves to a coevolutionarily stable equilibrium at intermediate levels of investment (and, generally, at a low frequency of resistance). At a higher cost of immunity and as transmission intensifies, the system is not evolutionarily stable but rather cycles around intermediate levels of investment. At more intense transmission, neither host nor parasite invests any resources in dominating its partner so that no resistance is observed in the population. These results may help to explain the lack of encapsulated malaria parasites generally observed in natural populations of mosquito vectors, despite strong selection pressure for resistance in areas of very intense transmission.

TI Interactions over four trophic levels: foodplant quality affects
   development of a hyperparasitoid as mediated through a herbivore and its
   primary parasitoid
AB 1. Related plant species with different spatial and/or temporal life-history characteristics often possess differences in secondary chemistry and thus direct defensive capability. These differences are often attributed to a range of divergent selection pressures from herbivores and pathogens. Most studies of insect-plant interactions have examined the effects of plant defence on herbivore performance, with less attention being paid to higher trophic levels, such as parasitoid wasps. Moreover, to date it is not known whether secondary plant compounds may affect organisms in the fourth trophic level.
   2. Here, we study interactions in a four-trophic-level system. The development of a solitary secondary hyperparasitoid, Lysibia nana , and its primary endoparasitoid host, Cotesia glomerata , are compared when reared from a primary herbivore host, Pieris brassicae, which was itself reared on two cruciferous plants with contrasting life histories. Whereas L. nana is known to attack the pupae of a number of primary parasitoids in the genus Cotesia , both C. glomerata and P. brassicae are intimately associated with plants in the family Brassicaceae.
   3. Insects were reared from a feral population of the spring perennial, Brassica oleracea , and a naturally occurring population of a summer annual, B. nigra . Like other cruciferous plants, both species are known to produce glycoside toxins (= glucosinolates) after they are attacked by foliar herbivores. However, concentrations of glucosinolates were more than 3.5 times higher in young shoots of B. nigra than in corresponding shoots of B. oleracea .
   4. Cocoon weight in C. glomerata was unaffected by the foodplant on which P. brassicae was reared, whereas in 24-h-old host cocoons emerging adult hyperparasitoid body mass increased significantly with cocoon size and wasps were significantly larger, and survived better on B. oleracea than on B. nigra. Moreover, body mass in L. nana was typically larger in young (c. 24 h), than in older (c. 72 h) cocoons of C. glomerata. Egg-to-adult development time in L. nana generally increased with host size and age, and wasps on younger hosts completed their development more rapidly on B. nigra.
   5. Our results clearly demonstrate that qualitative differences in herbivore diet can differently affect the performance of interacting organisms across several trophic levels, and suggest that bottom-up forces may also play a role in mediating interactions involving plants-herbivores-parasitoids and hyperparasitoids.

TI Evolution of RNA virus in spatially structured heterogeneous
   environments
AB A hallmark of the infectious cycle for many RNA viruses parasitizing multicellular hosts is the need to invade and successfully replicate in tissues that comprise a variety of cell types. Thus, multicellular hosts represent a heterogeneous environment to evolving viral populations. To understand viral adaptation to multicellular hosts, we took a double approach. First, we developed a mathematical model that served to make predictions concerning the dynamics of viral populations evolving in heterogeneous environments. Second, the predictions were tested by evolving vesicular stomatitis virus in vitro on a spatially structured environment formed by three different cell types. In the absence of gene flow, adaptation was tissue-specific, but fitness in all tissues decreased with migration rate. The performance in a given tissue was negatively correlated with its distance to the tissue hosting the population. This correlation decreased with migration rate.

Among 871 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and 439 high-risk HIV-uninfected women, seroprevalences of cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and prevalence of human papillomavirus DNA in cervicovaginal lavage fluids were all >50% and were 2-30 times higher than prevalences in the general population. Prevalences were highest among HIV-infected women, of whom 44.2% had greater than or equal to5 other infections, and were relatively high even among the youngest women (age 16-25 years). In multivariate analyses, viral infections were independently associated not only with behaviors such as injection drug use and commercial sex but also with low income, low levels of education, and black race. Disadvantaged women and women who engage in high-risk behaviors are more likely to be coinfected with HIV and other viruses and, thus, may be at high risk of serious disease sequelae.

TI Cryptic species, cryptic endosymbionts, and geographical variation in
   chemical defences in the bryozoan Bugula neritina
AB Molecular markers often offer the only means to discriminate between species and to elucidate the specificity of many community interactions, both of which are key to the understanding of ecological patterns. Western Atlantic populations of the bryozoan Bugula neritina vary in the palatability of their larvae to predators: individuals south of Cape Hatteras produce chemical deterrents to fish predators that are absent in more northern individuals. We use mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) sequences to show that the differences in palatability between populations correlate with the geographical distributions of two cryptic species within B. neritina . Furthermore, these cryptic species differ in their associations with bacteria that may confer chemical resistance to predation. Small subunit rRNA primers specific to a subset of gamma-proteobacteria amplified only the bacterium Endobugula sertula from the southern cryptic species. Endobugula sertula produces a family of chemical compounds (bryostatins) that may deter predators of its animal host. In contrast, the same primers amplified an array of gamma-proteobacteria from the unprotected northern cryptic bryozoan species, but never E. sertula . In combination, these findings suggest that the geographical variation in palatability observed in the larvae of B. neritina is not the result of local adaptation of a single species to regions of differing predation pressure, but rather results from the comparison of cryptic species that differ in the presence or absence of a bacterium that may provide protection against predators. The ability to identify the cryptic Bugula species and their differing relationships with bacterial associates provides an example of the important role molecular techniques may play in addressing ecological questions.

TI Impact of nationwide measles vaccination campaign among children aged 9
   months to 14 years, Zimbabwe, 1998-2001
AB Zimbabwe (population 11,365,000) introduced nationwide one-dose measles vaccination in 1981. This strategy reached 70%-80% of infants <1 year of age over the next two decades; in 1998, a nationwide supplemental immunization activity (SIA) targeting all children aged 9 months to 14 years achieved 93% coverage. Surveillance data were examined to determine the impact of these strategies. During 1985-1997, there were 8529-49,812 measles cases annually. After the SIA, laboratory confirmation of the first 5 outbreak cases and all sporadic cases was required. In 1999 and 2000, 1343 (88%) of 1534 suspected cases had adequate specimens submitted and 28 (2%) were measles IgM positive. In 2001, of 529 suspected cases, 513 (97%) had adequate specimens and only 7 (1%) were measles IgM positive. These data suggest that indigenous measles transmission in Zimbabwe has been interrupted and that high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity does not hinder vaccination-induced measles control. High vaccination coverage obtained through the routine health care system supplemented by periodic follow-up SIAs will be required to maintain low transmission levels.

AB In response to an outbreak of >33,000 measles cases in 1996-1998 and to prevent an outbreak predicted for 2002, Romania conducted a nationwide measles-rubella vaccination campaign in October 1998. Some 2.1 million children aged 7-18 years were vaccinated. Data from national surveillance and seroprevalence studies conducted in three districts were used to assess the campaign and status of measles control. Surveillance data showed a dramatic drop in measles despite enhanced surveillance starting in October 1999. From October 1999 to December 2001, 400 suspected measles cases were reported, down from about 5000 cases annually in non-outbreak years. Only 29 (8%) of 386 cases with specimens were laboratory confirmed; 14 were clinically confirmed. Seroprevalence estimates showed high measles antibody levels before (92.9%) and after (94.4%) the campaign. The low number of laboratory-confirmed cases and high population immunity suggest that interruption of indigenous measles virus transmission is a real possibility for Romania.

TI Functional consequences of genetic diversity in Strongyloides ratti
   infections
AB Parasitic nematodes show levels of genetic diversity comparable to other taxa, but the functional consequences of this are not understood. Thus, a large body of theoretical work highlights the potential consequences of parasite genetic diversity for the epidemiology of parasite infections and its possible implications for the evolution of host and parasite populations. However, few relevant empirical data are available from parasites in general and none from parasitic nematodes in particular. Here, we test two hypotheses. First, that different parasitic nematode genotypes vary in life-history traits, such as survivorship and fecundity, which may cause variation in infection dynamics. Second, that different parasitic nematode genotypes interact within the host (either directly or via the host immune system) to increase the mean reproductive output of mixed-genotype infections compared with single-genotype infections. We test these hypotheses in laboratory infections using genetically homogeneous lines of Strongyloides ratti. We find that nematode genotypes do vary in their survivorship and fecundity and, consequently, in their dynamics of infection. However, we find little evidence of interactions between genotypes within hosts under a variety of trickle- and single-infected infection regimes.

TI Antibody-mediated in vitro growth inhibition of field isolates of
   Plasmodium falciparum from asymptomatic children in Burkina Faso
AB Antibody-mediated inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in vitro reflects the potential parasite-neutralizing activity of the antibodies in vivo. In this study, immunoglobulins and P. falciparum isolates were collected from children with asymptomatic malaria in Burkina Faso. We demonstrate a significantly lower in vitro growth inhibitory activity against the P. falciparum field isolates by autologous host immunoglobulin compared with that of immunoglobulin from other individuals. To gain further insight to possible mechanisms for the diverse sensitivity observed, analyses of consecutive isolates taken 14 days apart were performed with regard to polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping and sensitivity to growth inhibition in vitro. All the asymptomatic infections were composed of multiple, genotypically distinct parasite clones, and at least one new parasite clone appeared in most of the day 14 isolates compared with the corresponding day 0 isolates. Apparently persisting parasite clones, present in both the day 0 and day 14 isolates from the same person, were also frequently observed. The day 14 isolates were more effectively inhibited by autologous day 14 immunoglobulin than by the corresponding day 0 immunoglobulin in 57% of the cases. However, the frequent presence of persisting parasite clones in asymptomatic children indicates that the parasite may develop a relative resistance to neutralizing immune responses.

TI Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of anopheles mosquitoes and
   Plasmodium falciparum transmission along the Kenyan coast
AB The seasonal dynamics and spatial distributions of Anopheles mosquitoes and Plasmodium falciparum parasites were studied for one year at 30 villages in Malindi, Kilifi, and Kwale Districts along the coast of Kenya. Anopheline mosquitoes were sampled inside houses at each site once every two months and malaria parasite prevalence in local school children was determined at the end of the entomologic survey. A total of 5,476 Anopheles gambiae s.l. and 3,461 An. funestus were collected. Species in the An. gambiae complex, identified by a polymerase chain reaction, included 81.9% An. gambiae s.s., 12.8% An. arabiensis, and 5.3% An. merus. Anopheles gambiae s.s. contributed most to the transmission of P. falciparum along the coast as a whole, while An. funestus accounted for more than 50% of all transmission in Kwale District. Large spatial heterogeneity of transmission intensity (<1 up to 120 infective bites per person per year) resulted in correspondingly large and significantly related variations in parasite prevalence (range=38-83%). Thirty-two percent of the sites (7 of 22 sites) with malaria prevalences ranging from 38% to 70% had annual entomologic inoculation rates (EIR) less than five infective bites per person per year. Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus densities in Kwale were not significantly influenced by rainfall. However, both were positively correlated with rainfall one and three months previously in Malindi and Kilifi Districts, respectively. These unexpected variations in the relationship between mosquito populations and rainfall suggest environmental heterogeneity in the predominant aquatic habitats in each district. One important conclusion is that the highly non-linear relationship between EIRs and prevalence indicates that the consistent pattern of high prevalence might be governed by substantial variation in transmission intensity measured by entomologic surveys. The field-based estimate of entomologic parameters on a district level does not provide a sensitive indicator of transmission intensity in this study.

TI Shared control of epidemiological traits in a coevolutionary model of
   host-parasite interactions
AB Most models concerning the evolution of a parasite's virulence and its host's resistance assume that each component of the relationship (transmission, virulence, recovery, etc.) is controlled by either the host or the parasite but not by both. We present a model that describes the coevolution of host and parasite, assuming that the rate of transmission or the virulence depends on both genotypes. The evolution of these traits is constrained by trade-offs that account for costs of defense and attack strategies, in line with previous studies on the separate evolution of the host and the parasite. Considering shared control by the host and the parasite in determining the traits of the relationship leads to several novel predictions. First, the host should evolve maximal investment in defense against parasites with an intermediate replication rate. Second, the evolution of the parasite strongly depends on the way the host's defense is described. Third, the coevolutionary process may lead to decreasing the parasite's virulence as a response to a rise in the host's background mortality, contrary to classical predictions.

TI Covert infections as a mechanism for long-term persistence of
   baculoviruses
AB The prevalence of pathogens in wild populations has often been estimated by the appearance of overt symptoms in the host, and this is typically used as the sole gauge of the impact of the pathogen on host dynamics. However, the development of molecular methods has increased the sensitivity with which we can detect asymptomatic infections. Baculoviruses are insect pathogens that, like many microparasites, are usually only found when their hosts reach outbreak densities, when a disease epizootic occurs. Conventional wisdom is that the long-term persistence of baculoviruses relies on their survival in the external environment in the form of occlusion bodies. These are proteinaceous matrices in which the virus particles are embedded, and which provide a degree of protection from UV irradiation. However, Mamestra brassicae has also been shown to harbour a persistent, non-lethal baculovirus infection (M. brassicae nucleopolyhedrovirus) in laboratory culture, which may represent another putative persistence mechanism. Here, we present evidence that such covert infections are also present and frequent in natural populations of the moth. The persistent infections were triggered into the lethal overt state by exposure to another baculovirus, and two closely related but different baculoviruses were subsequently identified as persistent infections within the populations sampled. These results have broad-ranging implications for our understanding of host pathogen interactions in the field, in the use of pathogens as biocontrol agents, and in the evolution of virulence.

HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, anti-HCV and anti-HIV-1/2 were tested for. The participants also completed a standard sociodemographic questionnaire, indicating possible risk factors, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and the life-time history of aggression. Anti-HIV antibodies were not found in any of the prisoners. HBsAg was found in 25 (13%), anti-HBc in 94 (49%), anti-HBs in 40 (21%) and anti-HCV in 13 (6(.)5%) subjects. Logistic regression analysis showed that anti-HCV positivity was associated with intravenous drug use (OR 20(.)7, 95% CI 1(.)1-4(.)9, P < 0(.)001), while HBsAg positivity was associated separately with being foreign (OR 4(.)0, 95% CI 0(.)2-2(.)5, P < 0(.)01), as well as with impulsiveness score (OR 1(.)06, 95 % CI 0(.)01-0(.)11, P < 0(.)02). The prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in this sex offender sample was highly increased in relation to the general population. Since it has been proved that sex offenders are a high-risk group for reoffending, monitoring their health is a necessary step towards prevention of sexually transmitted diseases being spread.

TI Peering through the looking glass at a sexual parasite: Are Amazon
   mollies red queens?
AB The gynogenetic Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa) is a clonal, all-female lineage of livebearing fish that faces an unusual obstacle to evolutionary persistence. Sperm from heterospecific males (either sailfin, P. latipinna, or Atlantic, P. mexicana, mollies) is necessary to trigger embryogenesis. However, none of the male's genes are incorporated into the genome of the gynogenetic offspring. Some investigators have proposed that the evolution of male mate discrimination is a result of this cost, leading to a coevolutionary arms race between male avoidance of P. formosa and P. formosa attractiveness. Given that P. formosa successfully reproduces and has not yet gone extinct, it is clear there are mechanisms by which they attract the sexual attention of male's. Although a Red Queen coevolutionary process in typical host/parasite systems has been shown to favor the persistence of sexual species, in this system an arms race has been invoked to explain the reverse. Here I present behavioral data supporting a more parsimonious scenario: that mechanisms of attraction in P. formosa are simply a consequence of its hybrid origin. Poecilia latipinna and P. mexicana males do not discriminate between gynogenetic P. formosa females and first generation sexual hybrid females, and females do not differ in agonistic behaviors associated with competition for mates. Both results contradict predictions from the Red Queen hypothesis. Therefore, coevolution is not necessary to explain the apparent evolutionary persistence of P. formosa.

TI Specific versus nonspecific immune defense in the bumblebee, Bombus
   terrestris L.
AB Hosts vary in both their strength of response to a general immunological insult and in their specific susceptibility to different parasite species or different strains of the same parasite. The variation in the general immune response is considered a result of the costs imposed by selection on defended individuals. The variation in the specific response may originate from variation in host and parasite genotypes and is a requirement for frequency-dependent selection. The relationship between these two fundamental aspects of defense has only rarely been studied. Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris and its gut trypanosomal parasite Crithidia bombi we found that the host's specific response profile toward different strains correlates negatively with its level of response to a general insult. This is the opposite result one would expect if the level of general response were simply a measure of immunological quality (immunocompetence). Rather, it suggests that there is some form of a trade-off between these two fundamental aspects of the immune system. These results, therefore, shed an important light on the possible constraints that affect the evolution of the immune system and particularly the trade-off between different arms of the immune system.

TI Evidence for interspecies transmission of viruses in natural populations
   of filamentous fungi in the genus Cryphonectria
AB Interspecies transmission is a significant evolutionary event that has allowed a variety of pathogens to invade new host species. We investigated interspecies transmission of viruses between the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica , and a sympatric unidentified Cryphonectria species in Japan. Two isolates of Cryphonectria sp. were found to contain Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV-1), which has been typically found in C. parasitica . Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis of interspecies transmission of CHV-1. First, host species occur sympatrically and therefore have the opportunity to come into physical contact. Second, we transmitted CHV-1 between species experimentally in the laboratory. Third, phylogenetic analysis of 476 bp of the ORF B region of CHV-1 showed that sequences from Cryphonectria sp. were more closely related to those from C. parasitica than to each other. Local geographical subdivision of virus sequences from both host species argues against the alternative hypothesis of independent evolution of CHV-1 since speciation of their hosts. Based on these findings, we rule out the hypotheses that CHV-1 diverged from viruses in a common ancestor of the hosts, or that ancestral polymorphisms in CHV-1 persisted in the two host taxa. Estimating the direction and frequency of interspecies transmission in nature will require more extensive samples of CHV-1 from both host species.

TI An assessment of preferential attachment as a mechanism for human sexual
   network formation
AB Recent research into the properties of human sexual-contact networks has suggested that the degree distribution of the contact graph exhibits power-law scaling. One notable property of this power-law scaling is that the epidemic threshold for the population disappears when the scaling exponent p is in the range 2 < rho <= 3. This property is of fundamental significance for the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as HIV/AIDS since it implies that an STD can persist regardless of its transmissibility. A stochastic process, known as preferential attachment, that yields one form of power-law scaling has been suggested to underlie the scaling of sexual degree distributions. The limiting distribution of this preferential attachment process is the Yule distribution, which we fit using maximum likelihood to local network data from samples of three populations: (i) the Rakai district, Uganda; (ii) Sweden. and (iii) the USA. For all local networks but one, our interval estimates of the scaling parameters are in the range where epidemic thresholds exist. The estimate of the exponent for male networks in the USA is close to 3, but the preferential attachment model is a very poor fit to these data. We conclude that the epidemic thresholds implied by this model exist in both single-sex and two-sex epidemic model formulations. A strong conclusion that we derive from these results is that public health interventions aimed at reducing the transmissibility of STD pathogens, such as implementing condom use or high-activity anti-retroviral therapy, have the potential to bring a population below the epidemic transition, even in populations exhibiting large degrees of behavioural heterogeneity.

TI Imperfect vaccination: some epidemiological and evolutionary
   consequences
AB An aim of some vaccination programmes is to reduce the prevalence of an infectious disease and ultimately to eradicate it. We show that eradication success depends on the type of vaccine as well as on the vaccination coverage. Vaccines that reduce the parasite within-host growth rate select for higher parasite virulence and this evolution may both increase the prevalence of the disease and prevent disease eradication. By contrast, vaccines that reduce the probability of infection select against virulence and may lead more easily to eradication. In some cases, epidemiological feedback on parasite evolution yields an evolutionary bistable situation where, for intermediate vaccination coverage, parasites can evolve towards either high or low virulence, depending on the initial conditions. These results have practical implications for the design and use of imperfect vaccines in public- and animal-health programmes.

AB Infection by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), as measured by the presence of specific antibodies, was shown in countries in which HHV-8 infection is endemic to exhibit familial aggregation and a peculiar variation with age (rapid increase until puberty followed by a plateau in young adults). To investigate whether host genetic factors could explain these findings, a segregation analysis was performed of 81 families of African origin (1623 subjects; HHV-8 seroprevalence, 11.9%) living in a village in French Guiana in which HHV-8 infection is endemic. Results provide evidence for a recessive gene controlling susceptibility or resistance to HHV-8 infection. This gene is predicted to have a major effect during childhood, with almost all homozygous predisposed subjects (similar to6% of the population) being infected by age 15. For nonpredisposed subjects, HHV-8 infection in childhood strongly depends on virus exposure (through an HHV-8-infected mother), whereas the risk of infection appears to be low in young adults, with no evidence for heterosexual transmission.

TI Phagocytosis and the inflammatory response
AB Macrophages are a cornerstone of the innate immune system. They detect infectious organisms via a plethora of receptors, phagocytose them, and orchestrate an appropriate host response. Phagocytosis is extraordinarily complex: numerous receptors stimulate particle internalization, the cytoskeletal elements mediating internalization differ by receptor system and the nature of the pathogen being internalized, and the outcome can differ by bacterium. After generating a panel of 150 monoclonal antibodies that recognizes proteins recruited to the phagosome, analysis of novel phagocytic proteins was prioritized by focusing on those that behave differently during the internalization of virulent and avirulent bacteria. Several novel proteins that have roles in membrane extension were characterized. Although the inflammatory pathways leading to appropriate host response are reasonably well defined, it is not clear how macrophages define the threat precisely. Recent work indicates that Toll-like receptors play a key role in reading a "bar code" on invading microorganisms and in eliciting a specific immune response. The mechanisms and coupling to the phagocytic response are discussed.

TI Macrophage migration inhibitory factor and host innate immune defenses
   against bacterial sepsis
AB Macrophages are essential effector cells of innate immunity that play a pivotal role in the recognition and elimination of invasive microorganisms. Mediators released by activated macrophages orchestrate innate and adaptive immune host responses. The cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an integral mediator of the innate immune system. Monocytes and macrophages constitutively express large amounts of MIF, which is rapidly released after exposure to bacterial toxins and cytokines. MIF exerts potent proinflammatory activities and is an important cytokine of septic shock. Recent investigations of the mechanisms by which MIF regulates innate immune responses to endotoxin and gram-negative bacteria indicate that MIF acts by modulating the expression of Toll-like receptor 4, the signal-transducing molecule of the lipopolysaccharide receptor complex. Given its role in innate immune responses to bacterial infections, MIF is a novel target for therapeutic intervention in patients with septic shock.

TI Parasite-mediated predation between native and invasive amphipods
AB Parasites can structure biological communities directly through population regulation and indirectly by processes such as apparent competition. However, the role of parasites in the process of biological invasion is less well understood and mechanisms of parasite mediation of predation among hosts are unclear. Mutual predation between native and invading species is an important factor in determining the outcome of invasions in freshwater amphipod communities. Here, we show that parasites mediate mutual intraguild predation among native and invading species and may thereby facilitate the invasion process. We find that the native amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus is host to a microsporidian parasite, Pleistophora sp. (new species), with a frequency of infection of 0-90%. However, the parasite does not infect three invading species, G. tigrinus, G. pulex and Crangonyx pseudogracilis. In field and laboratory manipulations, we show that the parasite exhibits cryptic virulence: the parasite does not affect host fitness in single-species populations, but virulence becomes apparent when the native and invading species interact. That is, infection has no direct effect on G. d. celticus survivorship, size or fecundity; however, in mixed-species experiments, parasitized natives show a reduced capacity to prey on the smaller invading species and are more likely to be preyed upon by the largest invading species. Thus, by altering dominance relationships and hierarchies of mutual predation, parasitism strongly influences, and has the potential to change, the outcome of biological invasions.

TI The use of short-course zidovudine to prevent perinatal transmission of
   human immunodeficiency virus in rural Kenya
AB To determine the feasibility of using short-course zidovudine (ZDV) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a breastfeeding population in a rural area in Kenya, pregnant mothers attending clinics in seven health centers in western Kenya between 1996 and 1998 were requested to volunteer for participation in this study. The HIV-infected mothers were given a daily dose of 400 mg of ZDV starting at 36 weeks of gestation and another 300 mg every three hours intrapartum. After delivery, mothers and their children were followed-up and clinically monitored every 3-4 months for two years, and child and mother mortality rates were analyzed. Of the 825 mothers who consented, 216 (26.2%) were infected with HIV. Of those infected, 51 (23.6%) took the full prescribed dose, 69 (31.9%) took only the prenatal dose, and the remaining 96 (44.4%) did not take any dose. Failure to take ZDV was attributed mainly to delivery occurring earlier than expected, while non-compliance to the intrapartum dose was due to mothers giving birth at home and fear of traditional birth attendants. By the end of the second year, 75 HIV-exposed children (34.7%) and 33 HIV-infected mothers (15.3%) had died. The HIV-free survival of children at 24 months was significantly associated with mother survival (P < 0.001) and prenatal ZDV compliance (P < 0.003). Our findings suggest that implementation of programs for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in rural areas of Africa need to consider the various socioeconomic and cultural barriers that may prevent successful uptake of antiretroviral prophylaxes. Similarly, the rapid disease progression in mothers may eliminate the increase in child survival due to ZDV prophylaxis.

TI Large genetic differentiation and low variation in vector competence for
   dengue and yellow fever viruses of Aedes albopictus from Brazil, the
   United States, and the Cayman Islands
AB We conducted a population genetic analysis of Aedes albopictus collected from 20 sites in Brazil, the United States (Florida, Georgia, and Illinois), and the Cayman Islands. Using isoenzyme analysis, we examined genetic diversity and patterns of gene flow. High genetic differentiation was found among Brazilian samples, and between them and North American samples. Regression analysis of genetic differentiation according to geographic distances indicated that Ae. albopictus samples from Florida were genetically isolated by distance. Infection rates with dengue and yellow fever viruses showed greater differences between two Brazilian samples than between the two North American samples or between a Brazilian sample and a North American sample. Introductions and establishments of new Ae. albopictus populations in the Americas are still in progress, shaping population genetic composition and potentially modifying both dengue and yellow fever transmission patterns.

TI Linking dynamical and population genetic models of persistent viral
   infection
AB This article develops a theoretical framework to link dynamical and population genetic models of persistent viral infection. This linkage is useful because, while the dynamical and population genetic theories have developed independently, the biological processes they describe are completely interrelated. Parameters of the dynamical models are important determinants of evolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift. We develop analytical methods, based on coupled differential equations and Markov chain theory, to predict the accumulation of genetic diversity within the viral population as a function of dynamical parameters. These methods are first applied to the standard model of viral dynamics and then generalized to consider the infection of multiple host cell types by the viral population. Each cell type is characterized by specific parameter values. Inclusion of multiple cell types increases the likelihood of persistent infection and can increase the amount of genetic diversity within the viral population. However, the overall rate of gene sequence evolution may actually be reduced.

TI Dynamics of multiple infection and within-host competition by the
   anther-smut pathogen
AB Infection of one host by multiple pathogen genotypes represents an important area of pathogen ecology and evolution that lacks a broad empirical foundation. Multiple infection of Silene latifolia by Microbotryum violaceum was studied under field and greenhouse conditions using the natural polymorphism for mating-type bias as a marker. Field transmission resulted in frequent multiple infection, and each stem of the host was infected independently. Within-host diversity of infections equaled that of nearby inoculum sources by the end of the growing season. The number of diseased stems per plant was positively correlated with multiple infection and with overwintering mortality. As a result, multiply infected plants were largely purged from the population, and there was lower within-host pathogen diversity in the second season. However, among plants with a given number of diseased stems, multiply infected plants had a lower risk of overwintering mortality. Following simultaneous and sequential inoculation, strong competitive exclusion was demonstrated, and the first infection had a significant advantage. Dynamics of multiple infection initially included components of coinfection models for virulence evolution and then components of superinfection models after systemic colonization. Furthermore, there was evidence for an advantage of genotypes with mating-type bias, which may contribute to maintenance of this polymorphism in natural populations.

TI How should environmental stress affect the population dynamics of
   disease?
AB We modelled how stress affects the population dynamics of infectious disease. We were specifically concerned with stress that increased susceptibility of uninfected hosts when exposed to infection. If such stresses also reduced resources, fecundity and/or survivorship, there was a reduction in the host carrying capacity. This lowered the contact between infected and uninfected hosts, thereby decreasing transmission. In addition, stress that increased parasite mortality decreased disease. The opposing effects of stress on disease dynamics made it difficult to predict the response of disease to environmental stress. We found analytical solutions with negative, positive, convex and concave associations between disease and stress. Numerical simulations with randomly generated parameter values suggested that the impact of host-specific diseases generally declined with stress while the impact of non-specific (or open) diseases increased with stress. These results help clarify predictions about the interaction between environmental stress and disease in natural populations.

TI Within-host parasite dynamics, emerging trade-off, and evolution of
   virulence with immune system
AB Virulence is an evolutionary paradox because parasites never benefit from their host's death. The adaptive explanation of virulence is classically based upon the existence of physiological constraints that create a trade-off between parasites' epidemiological traits (virulence, transmissibility, and clearance). Here we develop an epidemiological model where infections are dynamic processes and we demonstrate how these dynamics generate a trade-off between emerging epidemiological parameters. We then study how host's immune strength modifies this trade-off and hence influences virulence evolution. We found that in acute infections, where parasites are engaged in a race with immune cells, immunity restrains more the duration of the infection than its intensity. As a consequence parasites evolve to provoke more virulent but shorter infections in strongly immunized hosts.

TI Natural selection on immune responsiveness in blue tits Parus caeruleus
AB What is the form of natural selection on immune responsiveness? For a population at evolutionary equilibrium, there are two different scenarios. First, it is generally assumed that immune defense has both benefits and costs. If variation in immune responsiveness is due to variation in how individuals trade off these costs and benefits, one would expect immune responsiveness to be subject to stabilizing selection. Second, it is well known that an individual's immune responsiveness is often dependent on its overall condition. If immune responsiveness is condition-dependent, one would expect immune responsiveness to be under positive directional selection. We would therefore expect that the form of natural selection on immune responsiveness depends on the relative magnitude of these two sources of variation: variation in how individuals trade off the costs and benefits of defense, and variation in condition. We measured primary and secondary antibody responsiveness to diphtheria-tetanus vaccine in blue tits during winter and investigated the relationship between responsiveness and survival to the following breeding season. We use responsiveness to these antigens as measures of an individual's ability or propensity to mount an antibody response in case of an infection. Interestingly, different measures of responsiveness were subject to different selective regimes: primary responsiveness to diphtheria was subject to stabilizing selection, whereas secondary responsiveness to tetanus was subject to positive directional selection. In contrast, there was no significant selection on primary responsiveness to tetanus or secondary responsiveness to diphtheria. The finding of stabilizing selection on a measure of responsiveness is evidence that immune defense can incur fitness costs; a central but little-tested assumption of theories of the ecology and evolution of immunological defense. The finding of directional selection on a measure of responsiveness is consistent with the idea that immune responsiveness is condition-dependent, although we cannot rule out the alternative explanation that the population is not at evolutionary equilibrium with respect to this trait.

TI Parasitism and developmental plasticity in Alpine swift nestlings
AB 1. Development plasticity is a common evolutionary and phenotypic response to poor growth condition, in particular in organisms with determinate growth such as most birds and mammals. Because various body structures can contribute differently to overall fitness, natural selection will adjust the degree of plasticity of each structure to its proportionate contribution to fitness at a given life stage.
   2. Two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms can account for plasticity in the growth of offspring to compensate for the effect of parasites. First, if parasite infestation levels fluctuate over the nestling period, parasitized young may show reduced growth until peak parasite infestation, and accelerated growth once the conditions improve (the accelerated growth hypothesis). Secondly, if the period of tissue maturation is not fixed in time, hosts may grow slower than parasite-free hosts but for a longer period of time (the delayed maturation hypothesis).
   3. To test whether hosts compensate for the effects of parasites on their development, the load of the blood-sucking louse-fly Crataerina melbae Rondani in the nests of Alpine swifts, Apus melba Linnaeus, was increased or decreased experimentally. Parasite prevalence was 100% in both treatments, but intensity (no. of parasites per nestling) was significantly lower for deparasitized nestlings. In both treatments, parasite intensity increased up to halfway through the rearing period (i.e. 30 days of age) and decreased afterwards.
   4. In line with the accelerated growth hypothesis, wings of parasitized nestlings grew at a lower rate than those of deparasitized ones before the peak of parasite infestation, but at a greater rate after the peak. Louse-flies had no significant effect on the growth of body mass. In agreement with the delayed-maturation hypothesis, wings of parasitized nestlings grew for 3 additional days and were of similar size at fledging as in deparasitized birds.
   5. In summary, the present study shows in a wild bird population that nestling hosts can compensate for the effect of parasitism on their phenotype. It emphasizes the need to take the dynamics of parasite populations into account in studies of host-parasite relationships, and to investigate the effect of parasites on host development over the entire growing period rather than only at fledging, as employed traditionally.

TI Opposites attract? Mate choice for parasite evasion and the evolutionary
   stability of sex
AB If sex is naturally selected as a way to combat parasites, then sexual selection for disease resistance might increase the overall strength of selection for outcrossing. In the present study, we compared how two forms of mate choice affect the evolutionary stability of outcrossing in simultaneous hermaphrodites. In the first form, individuals preferred to mate with uninfected individuals (condition-dependent choice). In the second form, individuals preferred to mate with individuals that shared the least number of alleles in common at disease-resistance loci. The comparisons were made using individual-based computer simulations in which we varied parasite virulence, parasite transmission rate, and the rate of deleterious mutation at 500 viability loci. We found that alleles controlling both forms of mate choice spread when rare, but their effects on the evolutionary stability of sex were markedly different. Surprisingly, condition-dependent choice for uninfected mates had little effect on the evolutionary stability of sexual reproduction. In contrast, active choice for mates having different alleles at disease-resistance loci had a pronounced positive effect, especially under low rates of deleterious mutation. Based on these results, we suggest that mate choice that increases the genetic diversity of offspring can spread when rare in a randomly mating population, and, as an indirect consequence, increase the range of conditions under which sexual reproduction is evolutionarily stable.

TI High frequency of resistant viruses harboring different mutations in
   amantadine-treated children with influenza
AB Clinical samples from 15 amantadine-treated children were collected serially-before, during, and/or after treatment and were studied to determine the actual prevalence, timing, and clinical implications of M2 mutational events. After viral RNA extraction and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification of the viral RNA encoding the M2 protein, the products were cloned into plasmids, and their sequences were determined. Five mutations known to confer amantadine resistance in clinical samples were identified in 12 (80%) of 15 evaluable patients, and 9 patients had >1 (2-4) mutant virus. The pattern of emergence of mutant strains was clarified from the study of 6 patients with at least 4 serial samples. Although viruses with M2 mutations tended to become the dominant populations, in 2 cases, wild-type viruses became dominant after decreasing to low levels. These results suggest that resistant viruses emerge in a much higher proportion of amantadine-treated patients than has been suggested by previous studies.

TI Killing of African trypanosomes by antimicrobial peptides
AB Antimicrobial peptides are components of the innate immune systems of a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms and are being developed as antibiotics in the fight against bacterial and fungal infections. We explored the potential activities of antimicrobial peptides against the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei, a vector-borne protozoan parasite that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in both humans and animals. Three classes of mammalian antimicrobial peptides were tested: alpha-defensins, beta-defensins, and cathelicidins. Although members of all 3 classes of antimicrobial peptides showed activity, those derived from the cathelicidin class were most effective, killing both insect and bloodstream forms of the parasite. The mechanism of action of the cathelicidins against T. brucei involves disruption of surface membrane integrity. Administration of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides to mice with late-stage T. brucei infection acutely decreased parasitemia and prolonged survival. These results highlight the potential use of antimicrobial peptides for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis.

TI Effects of Wolbachia on mtDNA variation in two fire ant species
AB Wolbachia are endosymbiotic bacteria that infect arthropods. As they are maternally transmitted, the spread of Wolbachia variants within host populations may affect host mtDNA evolution. We sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene from numerous individuals of two Wolbachia -infected fire ant species, Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri , to determine how these bacteria influence patterns of mtDNA variation. As predicted, there was a strong association between Wolbachia strain and host mtDNA lineage within and between these fire ant species. However, there was no consistent association between the presence of Wolbachia and a reduction in mtDNA diversity. Moreover, patterns of mtDNA variation within Wolbachia-infected populations did not differ consistently from neutral expectations, despite our prediction that strong positive selection acting on Wolbachia influences the evolutionary dynamics of other cytoplasmic genomes. Specifically, while values of Tajima's D consistently were less than zero for all six samples of fire ants harbouring Wolbachia, MacDonald-Kreitman tests suggested that the patterns of variation were different from those expected under neutrality in only two of the samples. We conclude that these neutrality tests do not unambiguously reveal a clear effect of Wolbachia infection on patterns of mtDNA variation and substitution in fire ants. Finally, consistent with an earlier study, our data revealed the presence of two divergent mtDNA haplotype lineages and Wolbachia strains within S. invicta. Recognition of these two lineages has important consequences for interpreting patterns of mtDNA evolution and genetic differentiation between conspecific social forms of this species.

TI Wolbachia and genetic variability in the birdnest blowfly
   Protocalliphora sialia
AB Wolbachia are widespread cytoplasmically inherited bacteria that induce various reproductive alterations in host arthropods, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), an incompatibility between sperm and egg that typically results in embryonic death. CI has been invoked as a possible mechanism for reproductive isolation and speciation in arthropods, by restricting gene flow and promoting maintenance (and evolution) of genetic divergence between populations. Here we investigate patterns of Wolbachia infection and nuclear and mitochondrial differentiation in geographical populations of the birdnest blowfly Protocalliphora sialia . Blowflies in western North America are infected with two A-group Wolbachia , with some individuals singly and others doubly infected. Individuals in eastern North America mostly show single infections with a B-group Wolbachia. Populations in the Midwest are polymorphic for infections and show A- or B-group infection. There is a low level of mitochondrial divergence and perfect concordance of mitochondrial haplotype with infection type, suggesting that two Wolbachia-associated selective sweeps of the mitochondrion have occurred in this species. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis of nuclear genetic variation shows genetic differentiation between the eastern-Midwestern and western populations. Both Midwestern and eastern flies infected with A-Wolbachia show eastern nuclear genetic profiles. Current results therefore suggest that Wolbachia has not acted as a major barrier to gene flow between western and eastern-Midwestern populations, although some genetic differentiation between A-Wolbachia infected and B-Wolbachia infected individuals in eastern-Midwestern populations cannot be ruled out.

   disease
AB We propose a new threshold quantity for the analysis of the epidemiology of infectious diseases. The quantity is similar in concept to the familiar basic reproduction ratio, R-0, but it singles out particular host types instead of providing a criterion that is uniform for all host types. Using this methodology we are able to identify the long-term effects of disease-control strategies for particular subgroups of the population, to estimate the level of control necessary when targeting control effort at a subset of host types, and to identify host types that constitute a reservoir of infection. These insights cannot be obtained by using R-0 alone.

TI Parasite infection, host resistance and mate choice: battle of the
   genders in a simultaneous hermaphrodite
AB Parasites have been proposed to be fundamental in the evolution of mate choice because differential mating on the basis of heritable disease resistance is expected to lead to progeny with a better genome-environment match than random mating. However, direct empirical data in support of this hypothesis are often lacking, and the relative influences of current and potential infection status (i.e. resistance genotype), and of mate choice versus mate conflict, remain largely unknown. We demonstrate experimentally, using simultaneous hermaphroditic snails (Biomphalaria glabrata) artificially selected for resistance or susceptibility to Schistosoma mansoni infection, that mate choice is influenced by a combination of current and potential parasitic infection status. As predicted by game-theory models, we also found a picture of conflict and cooperation: resistant and susceptible genotypes copulated in either gender and reciprocated (i.e. switched gender) equally when faced with an uninfected partner, but, by contrast, resistant snails actively refused to copulate as females with an infected partner. Such recognition and discrimination has implications for the maintenance of sex and the evolution of recognition systems.

TI Variable male potential rate of reproduction: high male mating capacity
   as an adaptation to parasite-induced excess of females?
AB Numerous animals are known to harbour intracytoplasmic symbionts that gain transmission to a new host generation via female eggs and not male sperm. Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are a typical example. They infect a large range of arthropod species and manipulate host reproduction in several ways. In terrestrial isopods (woodlice), Wolbachia are responsible for converting males into females (feminization (F)) in some species, or for infertility in certain host crosses in other species (cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI)). Wolbachia with the F phenotype impose a strong excess of females on their host populations, while Wolbachia expressing CI do not. Here, we test the possibility that male mating capacity (MC) is correlated with Wolbachia-induced phenotype. We show that males of isopod hosts harbouring F Wolbachia possess a strong MC (i.e. are able to mate with several females in a short time), while those of species harbouring CI Wolbachia possess a weaker MC. This pattern may be explained either by the selection of high MC following the increase in female-biased sex ratios, or because the F phenotype would lead to population extinction in species where MC is not sufficiently high. This last hypotheses is nevertheless more constrained by population structure.

   in Florida, 2001
AB After West Nile virus (WNV) was first detected in Florida in July 2001, intensive surveillance efforts over the following five months uncovered virus activity in 65 of the state's 67 counties with 1,106 wild birds, 492 horses, 194 sentinel chickens, and 12 people found infected with the virus. Thirteen of 28 mosquito isolations came from Culex mosquitoes. As seen in the northeastern United States, wild bird mortality was the most sensitive surveillance method. However, unlike the predominantly urban 1999 and 2000 epizootics, the Florida transmission foci were rural with most activity detected in the northern part of the state. All human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV in animals; however, only eight of the twelve cases were preceded by reports of WNV activity in the county of residence. West Nile virus-positive animals detected by multiple surveillance systems preceded seven of these cases by two weeks or more.

AB Experimental systems that model some of the complex interactions between parasite and host can be extremely valuable in identifying and developing new prophylactics and therapeutics against human diseases. Because primates have similar immune systems to humans, we have characterized a baboon model for understanding host response to Plasmodium knowlesi. Ten intact olive baboons (Papio, anubis) of either sex were experimentally infected with P. knowlesi H strain erythrocytic parasites. The infection in these baboons was either acute or chronic. Animals with acute infection developed multiple system organ dysfunction and cerebral involvement. In chronically infected animals, only the spleen was moderately enlarged. The P. knowlesi parasitemia profile in baboons and rhesus monkeys was comparable. However, some clinical symptoms of the baboons and P. falciparum-infected humans were similar. These studies demonstrate for the first time that P. anubis is a suitable host for P. knowlesi for studying clinical symptoms and pathology.

TI Coevolution in temporally variable environments
AB Many potentially mutualistic interactions are conditional, with selection that varies between mutualism and antagonism over space and time. We develop a genetic model of temporally variable coevolution that incorporates stochastic fluctuations between mutualism and antagonism. We use this model to determine conditions necessary for the coevolution of matching traits between a host and a conditional mutualist. Using an analytical approximation, we show that matching traits will coevolve when the geometric mean interaction is mutualistic. When this condition does not hold, polymorphism and trait mismatching are maintained, and coevolutionary cycles may result. Numerical simulations verify this prediction and suggest that it remains robust in the presence of temporal autocorrelation. These results are compared with those from spatial models with unrestricted movement. The comparisons demonstrate that gene flow is unnecessary for generating empirical patterns predicted by the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.

TI Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus: Origin hypothesis
AB Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is a serious swine disease that appeared suddenly in the mid-western United States and central Europe approximately 14 years ago; the disease has now spread worldwide. In North America and Europe, the syndrome is caused by two genotypes of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus whose genomes diverge by approximately 40%. My hypothesis, which explains the origin and evolution of the two distinct PRRSV genotypes, is that a mutant of a closely related arterivirus of mice (lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus) infected wild boars in central Europe. These wild boars functioned as intermediate hosts and spread the virus to North Carolina in imported, infected European wild boars in 1912; the virus then evolved independently on the two continents in the prevalent wild hog populations for approximately 70 years until independently entering the domestic pig population.

AB Six countries (Denmark, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands) conducted large serological surveys for mumps, in the mid-1990s, as part of the European Sero-Epidemiology Network (ESEN). The assay results were standardized and related to the schedules and coverage of the immunization programmes and the reported incidence of mumps. Low incidence of disease and few susceptibles amongst adolescents and young adults was observed in countries with high mumps vaccine coverage (e.g. the Netherlands). High disease incidence and large proportions of mumps virus antibody negative samples in adolescent and young adult age groups was noted in countries with poor vaccine coverage (e.g. Italy). The build-up of susceptibles in older children and adolescents in England and Wales, France, the former West Germany and Italy indicate the possibility of further mumps outbreaks in secondary school environments. To control mumps in western Europe, current MMR immunization programmes will need to be strengthened in a number of countries. Sero-surveillance of mumps is an important component of disease control and its usefulness will be enhanced by the development of an international mumps standard.

TI Seroepidemiology of hepatitis B virus in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia:
   transmission patterns and vaccine control
AB A community-based seroepidemiological survey of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was conducted in 1994 to inform on the transmission dynamics and control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Venous blood from 4736 individuals under 50 years of age from 1262 households, selected using stratified cluster-sampling, was screened for HBV markers using commercial ELISAs. HBsAg prevalence was 7% (95% CI 6-8). higher in males (9%; 7-10) than females (5%; 4-6). HBeAg prevalence in HBsAg positives was 23% (18-29), and less than 1% of women of childbearing age were HBeAg positive. Overall HBV seroprevalence (any marker), rose steadily with age to over 70% in 40-49 year olds, indicating significant childhood and adult transmission. Estimated instantaneous incidence was 3-4/100 susceptibles/year, higher in males than females in 0-4 year olds, and peaking in early childhood and young adults. The age at which 50% had evidence of infection was around 20 years, and the herd immunity threshold is approximated at 63-77%. Addis Ababa is of intermediate-high HBV endemicity, with negligible perinatal transmission. Our main findings are the identification of a significant difference between males and females in the age-acquisition of HBV infection, and marked differences between age groups in HBV incidence rates. These results should target future research studies of underlying risk factors. Furthermore, we generate a crude estimate of the level of coverage of HBV vaccine that would be required to eliminate the virus from the study population.

   transmission, using multiple virus load markers
AB Maternal plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RNA load has a role in perinatal transmission, but significant overlap in the range of plasma virus loads among transmitters and nontransmitters is often observed, which makes it difficult to predict transmission outcome. We measured several virus markers in a drug-naive population of HIV-1-infected mothers in Botswana. Maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell-associated blood HIV-1 DNA load, and cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) HIV-1 DNA load were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The overall rate of transmission among these mother-infant pairs was 35.7%. Median infant age was 2.5 months. An association between increased plasma HIV-1 RNA load and perinatal transmission was observed (odds ratio [OR], 2.20/1-log virus load; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.18). However, the association between increased blood HIV-1 DNA load and perinatal transmission was stronger (OR, 10.30; 95% CI, 2.11-50.38). When blood HIV-1 DNA load was combined with CVF HIV-1 DNA load, the association with transmission increased (OR, 25.0; 95% CI 2.73-228.60).

TI Natural variation in populations of persistently colonizing bacteria
   affect human host cell phenotype
AB The highly diverse bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which persistently colonizes the human stomach, provides models to study the role of genome plasticity in host adaptation. Within H. pylori populations from 2 colonized individuals, intragenomic recombination between cagA DNA repeat sequences leads to deletion or duplication of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the CagA protein, which is injected by a type IV secretion system into host cells. Experimental coculture of gastric epithelial cells with the strains containing these naturally occurring CagA phosphorylation site variants induced markedly divergent host cell morphologic responses. Mutants were constructed in which a phosphorylation site was either added or deleted in the expressed CagA protein; coculture studies confirmed that the naturally occurring differences in CagA phosphorylation are responsible for the observed phenotypic variation. These findings indicate that within an individual host, intragenomic recombination between H. pylori repetitive DNA produces strain variants differing in their signals to host cells.

TI Neighbourhood control policies and the spread of infectious diseases
AB We present a model of a control programme for a disease outbreak in a population of livestock holdings. Control is achieved by culling infectious holdings when they are discovered and by the pre-emptive culling of livestock on holdings deemed to be at enhanced risk of infection. Because the pre-emptive control programme cannot directly identify exposed holdings, its implementation will result in the removal of both infected and uninfected holdings. This leads to a fundamental trade-off: increased levels of control produce a greater reduction in transmission by removing more exposed holdings, but increase the number of uninfected holdings culled. We derive an expression for the total number of holdings culled during the course of an outbreak and demonstrate that there is an optimal control policy, which minimizes this loss. Using a metapopulation model to incorporate local clustering of infection, we examine a neighbourhood control programme in a locally spreading outbreak. We find that there is an optimal level of control, which increases with increasing basic reproduction ratio, R-0; moreover, implementation of control may be optimal even when R-0 < 1. The total loss to the population is relatively insensitive to the level of control as it increases beyond the optimal level, suggesting that over-control is a safer policy than under-control.

TI Epidemiology, hypermutation, within-host evolution and the virulence of
   Neisseria meningitidis
AB Many so-called pathogenic bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are far more likely to colonize and maintain populations in healthy individuals asymptomatically than to cause disease. Disease is a dead-end for these bacteria: virulence shortens the window of time during which transmission to new hosts can occur and the subpopulations of bacteria actually responsible for disease, like those in the blood or cerebral spinal fluid, are rarely transmitted to new hosts. Hence, the virulence factors underlying their occasional pathogenicity must evolve in response to selection for something other than making their hosts sick. What are those selective pressures? We address this general question of the evolution of virulence in the context of phase shifting in N. meningitidis, a mutational process that turns specific genes on and off, and, in particular, contingency loci that code for virulence determinants such as pili, lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides and outer membrane proteins. We use mathematical models of the epidemiology and the within-host infection dynamics of N. meningitidis to make the case that rapid phase shifting evolves as an adaptation for colonization of diverse hosts and that the virulence of this bacterium is an inadvertent consequence of short-sighted within-host evolution, which is exasperated by the increased mutation rates associated with phase shifting. We present evidence for and suggest experimental and retrospective tests of these hypotheses.

TI Host-based divergence in populations of the pea aphid: insights from
   nuclear markers and the prevalence of facultative symbionts
AB In North America, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum encompasses ecologically and genetically distinct host races that offer an ideal biological system for studies on sympatric speciation. In addition to its obligate symbiont Buchnera, pea aphids harbour several facultative and phylogenetically distant symbionts. We explored the relationships between host races of A. pisum and their symbiotic microbiota to gain insights into the historical process of ecological specialization and symbiotic acquisition in this aphid. We used allozyme and microsatellite markers to analyse the extent of genetic differentiation between populations of A. pisum on pea, alfalfa and clover in France. In parallel, we examined: (i) the distribution of four facultative symbionts; and (ii) the genetic variation in the Buchnera genome across host-associated populations of A. pisum. Our study clearly demonstrates that populations of A. pisum on pea, clover and alfalfa in France are genetically divergent, which indicates that they constitute distinct host races. We also found a very strong association between host races of A. pisum and their symbiotic microbiota. We stress the need for phylogeographic studies to shed light on the process of host-race formation and acquisition of facultative symbionts in A. pisum. We also question the effects of these symbionts on aphid host fitness, including their role in adaptation to a host plant.

TI Larval swimming overpowers turbulent mixing and facilitates transmission
   of a marine parasite
AB Planktonic cercariae (parasite larvae) of digenetic flatworms (Himasthla rhigedana) encyst up to 100% of intermediate host populations. Toward explaining such high prevalence, larval behavior and passive-transport processes were evaluated experimentally for their roles in waterborne parasite transmission. Using a new application of laser and digital video imaging technologies, we quantified cercarial movements in still water and in simulated field flows. In still water, downward swimming in response to light,irrespective of intensity or source, and gravity brought larvae to the bottom three-times faster than gravitational sinking alone. A 33% elevation in temperature (18-24degreesC) caused a 71% increase in swim speed. In flume flows characteristic of southern California salt marshes (u(*) =. 0.2 cm/s, occurring >80% of the time), vertical larval distributions were highly bottom skewed. The mean downward swim speed (0.59 cm/s at 24degreesC) was three times faster than turbulent fluctuations (w' = 0.23 cm/s), indicating that cercariae overpowered eddies to reach the bed. When flume flows simulated rare storm events (u(*) = 0.8 cm/s, w' = 0.95 cm/s, occurring less than or equal to1% of the time), turbulence overwhelmed behavioral effects and homogeneously mixed larvae throughout the water column. Environmentally triggered, downward swimming can thus quickly bring larvae to the bed, promoting contact with benthic intermediate hosts (snails and crabs) under most flow conditions. The efficacy,of vertical swimming in typical marsh flows identifies larval behavior, not passive transport, as the principal mechanism responsible for dispersal to host habitat.

TI Keeping the herds healthy and alert: implications of predator control
   for infectious disease
AB Predator control programmes are generally implemented in an attempt to increase prey population sizes. However, predator removal could prove harmful to prey populations that are regulated primarily by parasitic infections rather than by predation. We develop models for microparasitic and macroparasitic infection that specify the conditions where predator removal will (a) increase the incidence of parasitic infection, (b) reduce the number of healthy individuals in the prey population and (c) decrease the overall size of the prey population. In general, predator removal is more likely to be harmful when the parasite is highly virulent, macroparasites are highly aggregated in their prey, hosts are long-lived and the predators select infected prey.

TI Fever and phenotype: transgenerational effect of disease on desert
   locust phase state
AB Natural enemy attack can cause transgenerational shifts in phenotype such that offspring are less vulnerable to future attack. Desert locusts ( Schistocerca gregaria) show density-dependent variation in their resistance to pathogens, such that they are less vulnerable to pathogens when in the high-density gregarious phase state ( when they would probably be more exposed to pathogens) than when in the solitarious phase state. We therefore hypothesized that infected gregarious parents would maintain this phenotype in their offspring. We infected gregarious desert locust nymphs with the fungal pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum, and allowed them to survive to reproduction by means of behavioural fever. The phase state of the locust offspring was assessed by their colouration and behavioural assays. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found an increase in solitarization in the infected population (14.6% solitarious offspring from infected parents, vs. <2% from uninfected counterparts at equivalent density). In a second experiment, we simulated behavioural fever temperatures and obtained a similar result (13.6% solitarious offspring vs. 4.4% from controls), implying that the phenomenon is probably a side-effect of the hosts' fever response. Identification of this novel environmental factor affecting locust phase state could have important implications for the biological control of these major pests.

TI Parasite establishment in host communities
AB Many pathogens and parasites attack multiple host species, so their ability to invade a host community can depend on host community composition. We present a graphical isocline framework for studying disease establishment in systems with two host species, based on treating host species as resources. The isocline approach provides a natural generalization to multi-host systems of two related concepts in disease ecology - the basic reproductive rate of a parasite, and threshold host density. Qualitative isocline shape characterizes the threshold community configurations that permit parasite establishment. In general, isocline shape reflects the relative forces of inter- and intraspecific transmission of shared parasites. We discuss the qualitative implications of parasite isocline shape for issues of mounting concern in conservation ecology.

TI The evolutionary ecology of Plasmodium
AB Plasmodium, the aetiological agent of malaria, imposes a substantial public health burden on human society and one that is likely to deteriorate. Hitherto, the recent Darwinian medicine movement has promoted the important role evolutionary biology can play in issues of public health. Recasting the malaria parasite two-host life cycle within an evolutionary framework has generated considerable insight into how the parasite has adapted to life within both vertebrate and insect hosts. Coupled with the rapid advances in the molecular basis to host-parasite interactions, exploration of the evolutionary ecology of Plasmodium will enable identification of key steps in the life cycle and highlight fruitful avenues of research for developing malaria control strategies. In addition, elucidating the extent to which Plasmodium can respond to short- and long-term changes in selection pressures, i.e. its adaptive capacity, is even more crucial in predicting how the burden of malaria will alter with our rapidly evolving ecology.

AB We initiated a study to elucidate the ecology and epidemiology of hantavirus infections in northern Argentina. The northwestern hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS)-endemic area of Argentina comprises Salta and Jujuy Provinces. Between 1997 and 2000, 30 HPS cases were diagnosed in Jujuy Province (population 512,329). Most patients had a mild clinical course, and the death rate (13.3%) was low. We performed a serologic and epidemiologic survey in residents of the area, in conjunction with a serologic study in rodents. The prevalence of hantavirus antibodies in the general human population was 6.5%, one of the highest reported in the literature. No evidence of interhuman transmission was found, and the high prevalence of hantavirus antibody seemed to be associated with the high infestation of rodents detected in domestic and peridomestic habitats.

TI Early identification of common-source foodborne virus outbreaks in
   Europe
AB The importance of foodborne viral infections is increasingly recognized. Food handlers can transmit infection during preparation or serving; fruit and vegetables may be contaminated by fecally contaminated water used for growing or washing. And the globalization of the food industry mean that a contaminated food item may not be limited to national distribution. International outbreaks do occur, but little data are available about the incidence of such events and the food items associated with the highest risks. We developed a combined research and surveillance program for enteric viruses involving 12 laboratories in 9 European countries. This project aims to gain insight into the epidemiology of enteric viruses in Europe and the role of food in transmission by harmonizing (i.e., assessing the comparability of data through studies of molecular detection techniques) and enhancing epidemiologic surveillance. We describe the setup and preliminary results of our system, which uses a Web-accessible central database to track viruses and provides the foundation for an early warning system of foodborne and other common-source outbreaks.

TI Paecilomyces lilacinus vaginitis in an immunocompetent patient
AB Paecilomyces lilacinus, a saprobic filamentous fungus, found in soil, decaying vegetation, saunas, and laboratories (as an airborne contaminant), is an infrequent cause of human disease (1,2). Most cases of disease caused by the genus Paecilomyces occur in patients who have compromised immune systems, indwelling foreign devices, or intraocular lens implants (2,3). Rarely has disease been reported in immunocompetent hosts without any identifiable risk factor.
   We describe the first case of P. lilacinus isolated from a vaginal culture in a patient with vaginitis and review the published literature addressing P. lilacinus infections in immunocompetent patients. Our review demonstrates that the reports of P lilacinus infections in immunocompetent hosts have become more frequent in the last several years. This trend indicates that P. lilacinus may be an emerging pathogen.

TI Differential species-specific ectoparasitic mite intensities in two
   intimately coexisting sibling bat species: resource-mediated host
   attractiveness or parasite specialization?
AB 1. The mechanisms underlying host choice strategies by parasites remain poorly understood. We address two main questions: (i) do parasites prefer vulnerable or well-fed hosts, and (ii) to what extent is a parasite species specialized towards a given host species?
   2. To answer these questions, we investigated, both in the field and in the lab, a host-parasite system comprising one ectoparasitic mite (Spinturnix myoti) and its major hosts, two sibling species of bats (Myotis myotis and M blythii), which coexist intimately in colonial nursery roosts. We exploited the close physical associations between host species in colonial roosts as well as naturally occurring annual variation in food abundance to investigate the relationships between parasite intensities and (i) host species and (ii) individual nutritional status.
   3. Although horizontal transmission of parasites was facilitated by the intimate aggregation of bats within their colonial clusters, we found significant interspecific differences in degree of infestation throughout the 6 years of the study, with M. myotis always more heavily parasitized than M. blythii. This pattern was replicated in a laboratory experiment in which any species-specific resistance induced by exploitation of different trophic niches in nature was removed.
   4. Within both host species, S. myoti showed a clear preference for individuals with higher nutritional status. In years with high resource abundance, both bat hosts harboured more parasites than in low-resource years, although the relative difference in parasite burden across species was maintained. This pattern of host choice was also replicated in the laboratory. When offered a choice, parasites always colonized better-fed individuals.
   5. These results show first that host specialization in our study system occurred. Second, immediate parasite choice clearly operated towards the selection of hosts in good nutritional state.

TI Simultaneous hermaphrodites reproducing in pairs self-fertilize some of
   their eggs: an experimental test of predictions of mixed-mating and
   Hermaphrodite's Dilemma theory
AB Theory predicts (1) that mixed-mating systems (i.e. reproduction through both selfing and outcrossing) should usually not evolve and (2) that reproducing simultaneous hermaphrodites should be in a conflict over the preferred sexual role (The Hermaphrodite's Dilemma). In an in vitro system with the endoparasitic cestode Schistocephalus solidus, a simultaneous hermaphrodite, we tested predictions of both the mixed-mating and the Hermaphrodite's Dilemma theory. Using microsatellite markers, we measured the proportion of selfed offspring and the total reproductive output of each worm within pairs varying in mean weight and weight difference. Worms produced more outbred offspring not only with increasing total weight of the pair, but also with decreasing weight difference between the two paired worms. These results suggest: (1) that this parasite species reproduces by mixed-mating, which may be maintained by stochastic density fluctuations in the definitive host and hence unpredictability of self reproduction and (2) reproductive conflict may prevent worm pairs from achieving an optimal intermediate selfing rate.

TI Mannose-binding lectin polymorphisms in clinical tuberculosis
AB Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) mediates protection against infections by using the complement system, but certain microorganisms may increase infectivity by exploiting this host defense system. Thus, it has been speculated whether genetically determined low MBL levels may confer partial protection against certain intracellular microorganisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We investigated MBL alleles in 109 culture-positive human immunodeficiency virus-uninfected patients with tuberculosis living in Denmark and 250 white control subjects. Patients and control subjects were divided into 3 different groups defined by undetectable, low, and high serum MBL concentrations, which correlates to deficient, low, and high expressing MBL genotypes. A significantly decreased frequency of patients with the low-expressing MBL genotype was observed in white patients compared to control subjects. The same tendency also was observed in patients of other ethnic origin. It may be hypothesized that heterozygosity for MBL variant alleles, which encodes low serum MBL levels, is associated with protection against clinical tuberculosis.

TI Host genetic determinants of Neisseria meningitidis infections
AB The clinical presentation of infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis is highly diverse. Some patients develop meningitis, and others present with sepsis or even septic shock. After invasion of the bloodstream by the bacteria, three main cascade pathways are activated. These are the complement system, the inflammatory response, and the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathway. These pathways do not act independently but are able to interact with each other. Genetic polymorphisms among components of these pathways have been shown to be involved in the susceptibility, severity, and outcome of meningococcal disease. We review knowledge of genetic variations associated with susceptibility to and severity of meningococcal infection. Complement deficiencies and defects in sensing or opsonophagocytic pathways, such as the rare Toll-like receptor 4 single nucleoticle polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations of inefficient variants of Fcgamma-receptors, seem to have the most important role in genetically established susceptibility. Effect on severity has repeatedly been reported for FcgammaRIIa and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI1) polymorphisms. Outcome effects have been confirmed for SNPs in properdin deficiencies, PAI1 and combination of the -511C/T SNP in interleukin 1beta, and the +2018C/T SNIP in interleukin RN. Conflicting results are reported for the effect of the -308G/A promoter polymorphism in tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha. These differences may reflect discrepancies in group definitions between studies or the influence of additional SNPs in the TNFalpha promoter, which can form haplotypes representing different cytokine production capacity. For several SNPs, the potential effect on susceptibility, severity, or outcome has not yet been confirmed in an independent study.

TI Latent tuberculosis: mechanisms of host and bacillus that contribute to
   persistent infection
AB Most people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis contain the initial infection and develop latent tuberculosis. This state is characterised by evidence of an immune response against the bacterium (a positive tuberculin skin test) but no signs of active infection. It can be maintained for the lifetime of the infected person. However, reactivation of latent infection occurs in about 10% of infected individuals, leading to active and contagious tuberculosis. An estimated 2 billion people worldwide are infected with M tuberculosis-an enormous reservoir of potential tuberculosis cases. The establishment and reactivation of latent infection depend on several factors, related to both host and bacterium. Elucidation of the host immune mechanisms that control the initial infection and prevent reactivation has begun. The bacillus is well adapted to the human host and has a range of evasion mechanisms that contribute to its ability to avoid elimination by the immune system and establish a persistent infection. We discuss here current understanding of both host and bacterial factors that contribute to latent and reactivation tuberculosis.

TI Estimating the efficacy of interventions to prevent mother-to-child
   transmission of human immunodeficiency virus in breastfeeding
   populations: Comparing statistical methods
AB Postnatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus infection through breastfeeding complicates evaluating the efficacy of interventions aimed to reduce mother-to-child transmission risk. Results from trials in Africa evaluating either peripartum antiretroviral therapy or refraining from breastfeeding show an estimated long-term efficacy at 15-24 months of age between 25 and 50 percent. Differences in statistical methods, duration of follow-up, and age at weaning hinder direct comparison between trials. The authors recently outlined theoretically preferred statistical methods for evaluating interventions aimed to reduce risk of mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. When multiple test results and/or supplementary information is available, the more sophisticated methods account for the fact that exact age at infection is unknown, that risk for infection ends at weaning, or that censoring due to death may be informative. The authors apply these methods to four scenarios, using data from four randomized trials carried out in Africa between 1995 and 2000. The authors' findings suggest that, to estimate the cumulative proportion infected at age 6 weeks, a standard Kaplan-Meier approach is likely to give valid results. For estimation of this proportion at age 18 months, more sophisticated methods, such as the extension of the Kaplan-Meier procedure to interval-censored data and competing risks, would be preferred.

TI Cultivation of Tropheryma whipplei from cerebrospinal fluid
AB Whipple disease (WD) is a systemic disorder caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. Since the recognition of a bacterial etiology in 1961, many attempts have been made to cultivate this bacterium in vitro. It was eventually isolated, in 2000, from an infected heart valve, in coculture with human fibroblasts. Here we report the isolation of 2 new strains of T. whipplei from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 2 patients with intestinal WD but no neurological signs or symptoms. One culture-positive specimen was obtained before treatment; the other was obtained 12 months after discontinuation of therapy, at a time of intestinal remission. In both cases, 15 passages of the cultures were completed over 17 months. Bacterial growth was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, which suggested a generation time of 4 days. Staining with YO-PRO nucleic-acid dye showed characteristic rod-shaped bacteria arranged in chains. Fluorescent in situ hybridization with a T. whipplei-specific oligonucleotide probe, a broad-range bacterial probe, and a nonspecific nucleic-acid stain indicated that all visible bacteria were T. whipplei. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed both intracellular and extracellular bacteria. This first isolation of T. whipplei from CSF provides clear evidence of viable bacteria in the central nervous system in individuals with WD, even after prolonged antibiotic therapy.

TI Understanding omnivory needs a behavioral perspective
AB While the importance of omnivory in community and food web ecology has received recent recognition, the behavioral basis of omnivory has not been thoroughly explored. Here we argue that understanding the basis of food mixing (i.e., eating different food types) and food selection behavior is central to understanding the causes and consequences of omnivory. Despite the existence of several alternative hypotheses, constraints imposed by nutrients are often assumed to explain the function of food mixing by omnivores and herbivores. However, few studies have actually addressed this issue through rigorous tests of multiple hypotheses. To illustrate the importance of non-nutritive factors, we marshal evidence for the roles of toxin dilution, parasite avoidance and resistance, and predation risk in food mixing and food selection by omnivores and polyphagous herbivores. Whether food mixing stabilizes population, community, and food web dynamics is likely to depend on the details of food selection and the spatial and temporal scales of food mixing.

TI How virulent should a parasite be to its vector?
AB Vector-borne parasites are commonly predicted to be less virulent to the vector than to the definitive host as the parasite gains little by harming its main route of transmission. Here we assess the empirical evidence from systems in which insects are vectors for vertebrate, plant, and invertebrate parasites. The body of evidence supports lower (but nonzero) parasite virulence to vectors than to plant or invertebrate hosts, but not to vertebrate hosts. We consider why this might be by assessing evolutionarily stable strategies for an insect parasite that can infect both predator and prey (or vector and definitive host) and can have distinct virulences in these two potential hosts. In a homogeneous environment, the parasite is predicted to be equally virulent to predator and prey. However, in a patchy environment it is predicted to become benign toward the more mobile of the two potential hosts, provided interpatch movement of free parasites is low and competitive displacement among strains in a patch is weak. This prediction meets reality in that the vector is usually more mobile between patches than is the definitive host in plant and invertebrate systems, but not necessarily in vertebrate hosts.

TI The infection rate of Daphnia magna by Pasteuria ramosa conforms with
   the mass-action principle
AB In simple epidemiological models that describe the interaction between hosts with their parasites, the infection process is commonly assumed to be governed by the law of mass action, i.e. it is assumed that the infection rate depends linearly on the densities of the host and the parasite. The mass-action assumption, however, can be problematic if certain aspects of the host-parasite interaction are very pronounced, such as spatial compartmentalization, host immunity which may protect from infection with low doses, or host heterogeneity with regard to susceptibility to infection. As deviations from a mass-action infection rate have consequences for the dynamics of the host-parasite system, it is important to test for the appropriateness of the mass-action assumption in a given host-parasite system. In this paper, we examine the relationship between the infection rate and the parasite inoculum for the water flee Daphnia magna and its bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. We measured the fraction of infected hosts after exposure to 14 different doses of the parasite. We find that the observed relationship between the fraction of infected hosts and the parasite dose is largely consistent with an infection process governed by the mass-action principle. However, we have evidence for a subtle but significant deviation from a simple mass-action infection model, which can be explained either by some antagonistic effects of the parasite spores during the infection process, or by heterogeneity in the hosts' susceptibility with regard to infection.

Here we introduce a method for fitting stochastic transmission models to outbreak data to estimate bounds on key transmission parameters. We apply this method to data describing an outbreak of scrapie in a closed flock of Romanov sheep. The main findings are that the relative infectiousness of infected animals in this outbreak becomes appreciable early into disease incubation and that the mean incubation period is less than 1.5 years. We also find that the data are consistent with a broad range of values for the basic reproduction number R-0 and describe how the boundaries of this range depend on assumptions about the mean incubation period and the contribution to transmission of a long-lived environmental reservoir of infectivity.

TI Evolutionary implications of a high selfing rate in the freshwater snail
   Lymnaea truncatula
AB Self-compatible hermaphroditic organisms that mix self-fertilization and outcrossing are of great interest for investigating the evolution of mating systems. We investigate the evolution of selfing in Lymnaea truncatula, a self-compatible hermaphroditic freshwater snail. We first analyze the consequences of selfing in terms of genetic variability within and among populations and then investigate how these consequences along with the species ecology (harshness of the habitat and parasitism) might govern the evolution of selling. Snails from 13 localities (classified as temporary or permanent depending on their water availability) were sampled in western Switzerland and genotyped for seven microsatellite loci. F-IS (estimated on adults) and progeny array analyses (on hatchlings) provided similar setting rate estimates of 80%. Populations presented a low polymorphism and were highly differentiated (F-ST = 0.58). Although the reproductive assurance hypothesis would predict higher selfing rate in temporary populations, no difference in selfing level was observed between temporary and permanent populations. However, allelic richness and gene diversity declined in temporary habitats, presumably reflecting drift. Infection levels varied but were not simply related to either estimated population selfing rate or to differences in heterozygosity. These findings and the similar selfing rates estimated for hatchlings and adults suggest that within-population inbreeding depression is low in L. truncatula.

TI Linking coevolutionary history to ecological process: Doves and lice
AB Many host-specific parasites are restricted to a limited range of host species by ecological barriers that impede dispersal and successful establishment. In some cases, microevolutionary differentiation is apparent on top of host specificity, as evidenced by significant parasite population genetic structure among host populations. Ecological barriers responsible for specificity and genetic structure can, in principle, reinforce macroevolutionary processes that generate congruent host-parasite phylogenies. However, few studies have explored both the micro- and macroevolutionary ramifications of close association in a single host-parasite system. Here we compare the macroevolutionary histories of two genera of feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) that both parasitize New World pigeons and doves (Aves: Columbiformes). Earlier work has shown that dove body lice (genus Physconelloides) are more host specific and have greater population genetic structure than dove wing lice (Columbicola). We reconstructed phylogenies for representatives of the two genera of lice and their hosts, using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences. The phylogenies were well resolved and generally well supported. We compared the phylogenies of body lice and wing lice to the host phylogeny using reconciliation analyses. We found that dove body lice show strong evidence of cospeciation whereas dove wing lice do not. Although the ecology of body and wing lice is very similar, differences in their dispersal ability may underlie these joint differences in host specificity, population genetic structure, and coevolutionary history.

AB We describe the genetic structure of populations of the intestinal nematode Longistriata caudabullata (Trichostrongyloidea: Heligmosomidae), a common parasite of short-tailed shrews (genus Blarina, Insectivora: Soricidae). Parasites and hosts were collected from a transect across a contact zone between two species of hosts, Blarina brevicauda and B. hylophaga, in central North America. An 800-base pairs (bp) fragment of the ND4 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene was sequenced for 28 worms and a 783-bp fragment of the mtDNA control region was analysed for 16 shrews. Phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA sequences revealed reciprocal monophyly for the shrew species, concordant with morphological diagnosis, and supported the idea that the transect cuts through a secondary contact zone between well-differentiated B. brevicauda and B. hylophaga. In contrast to this pattern, the parasitic nematode mtDNA phylogeny was not subdivided according to host affiliation. Genealogical discordance between parasite and host phylogenies suggests extensive gene flow among parasites across the host species boundary.

TI Curtailing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome within a
   community and its hospital
AB Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been transmitted extensively within hospitals, and healthcare workers (HCWs) have comprised a large proportion of SARS cases worldwide. We present a stochastic model of a SARS outbreak in a community and its hospital. For a range of basic reproductive numbers (R-0) corresponding to conditions in different cities (but with emphasis on R-0 similar to 3 as reported for Hong Kong and Singapore), we evaluate contact precautions and case management (quarantine and isolation) as containment measures. Hospital-based contact precautions emerge as the most potent measures, with hospital-wide measures being particularly important if screening of HCWs is inadequate. For R-0 = 3, case isolation alone can control a SARS outbreak only if isolation reduces transmission by at least a factor of four and the mean symptom-onset-to-isolation time is less than 3 days. Delays of a few days in contact tracing and case identification severely degrade the utility of quarantine and isolation, particularly in high-transmission settings. Still more detrimental are delays between the onset of an outbreak and the implementation of control measures; for given control scenarios, our model identifies windows of opportunity beyond which the efficacy of containment efforts is reduced greatly. By considering pathways of transmission in our system, we show that if hospital-based transmission is not halted, measures that reduce community-HCW contact are vital to preventing a widespread epidemic. The implications of our results for future emerging pathogens are discussed.

Samples were analyzed by virus isolation in L20B and RD cell cultures, and wild polioviruses were characterized by sequencing of the VP1 protein coding region. Wild type 1 polioviruses were detected in 57% of the sewage samples and 91% of the study sites, only two of which reported paralytic poliomyelitis cases in 2001. Three genetic lineages of a single indigenous type 1 poliovirus genotype were detectable in sewage, and only one lineage was also detected through surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis. Wild polioviruses persisted in the environment despite implementation of oral poliovirus vaccine immunization campaigns. Continued analysis of sewage samples, critical evaluation of immunization coverage, and performance of surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis are proposed as follow-up activities.

TI Inbreeding depresses immune response in song sparrows (Melospiza
   melodia): direct and inter-generational effects
AB A thorough knowledge of relationships between host genotype and immunity to parasitic infection is required to understand parasite-mediated mechanisms of genetic and population change. It has been suggested that immunity may decline with inbreeding. However, the relationship between inbreeding level and a host's response to a novel immune challenge has not been investigated in a natural population. We used the pedigreed population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) inhabiting Mandarte Island, Canada, to test the hypothesis that a sparrow's cell-mediated immune response (CMI) to an experimental challenge would decline with individual or parental inbreeding. CMI in 6-day-old chicks declined significantly with their mother's coefficient of inbreeding, demonstrating an inter-generational effect of maternal inbreeding on offspring immunity. In fledged juveniles and adult sparrows, CMI declined markedly with an individual's own coefficient of inbreeding, but not its mother's. This relationship was consistent across seasons, and was not attributable solely to heterosis in offspring of immigrant breeders. CMI also declined with age and increased with body condition in adult sparrows, but inbreeding explained 37% of the total variation. We emphasize the implications of this dramatic inbreeding depression in cell-mediated immunity for theories of parasite-mediated evolution and the susceptibility of small, inbred populations.

TI A bacterial symbiont in the Bacteroidetes induces cytoplasmic
   incompatibility in the parasitoid wasp Encarsia pergandiella
AB Vertically transmitted symbionts of arthropods have been implicated in several reproductive manipulations of their hosts. These include cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), parthenogenesis induction in haplodiploid species (PI), feminization and male killing. One symbiont lineage in the alpha-Proteobacteria, Wolbachia, is the only bacterium known to cause all of these effects, and has been thought to be unique in causing CI, in which the fecundity of uninfected females is reduced after mating with infected males. Here, we provide evidence that an undescribed symbiont in the Bacteroidetes group causes CI in a sexual population of the parasitic wasp Encarsia pergandiella. Wasps were crossed in all four possible combinations of infected and uninfected individuals. In the cross predicted to be incompatible, infected (I) males x uninfected (U) females, progeny production was severely reduced, with these females producing only 12.6% of the number of progeny in other crosses. The incompatibility observed in this haplodiploid species was the female mortality type; dissections showed that most progeny from the incompatible cross died as eggs. The 16S rDNA sequence of this symbiont is 99% identical to a parthenogenesis-inducing symbiont in other Encarsia, and 96% identical to a feminizing symbiont in haplodiploid Brevipalpus mites. Thus, this recently discovered symbiont lineage is capable of inducing three of the four principal manipulations of host reproduction known to be caused by Wolbachia.

TI Tuberculosis in household contacts of infectious cases in Kampala,
   Uganda
AB Tuberculosis remains a serious threat to public health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. To determine the host and environmental factors responsible for tuberculosis in African households, the authors performed a prospective cohort study of 1,206 household contacts of 302 index cases with tuberculosis enrolled in Uganda between 1995 and 1999. All contacts were systematically evaluated for active tuberculosis and risk factors for active disease. Among the 1,206 household contacts, 76 secondary cases (6%) of tuberculosis were identified. Of these cases, 51 were identified in the baseline evaluation, and 25 developed during follow-up. Compared with index cases, secondary cases presented more often with minimal disease. The risk for secondary tuberculosis was greater among young children than adults (10% vs. 1.9%) and among human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive than -seronegative contacts (23% vs. 3.3%). Host risk factors could not be completely separated from the effects of environmental risk factors, suggesting that a household may represent a complex system of interacting risks for tuberculosis.

TI Comparative tests of parasite species richness in primates
AB Some hosts harbor diverse parasite communities, whereas others are relatively parasite free. Many factors have been proposed to account for patterns of parasite species richness, but few studies have investigated competing hypotheses among multiple parasite communities in the same host clade. We used a comparative data set of 941 host-parasite combinations, representing 101 anthropoid primate species and 231 parasite taxa, to test the relative importance of four sets of variables that have been proposed as determinants of parasite community diversity in primates: host body mass and life history, social contact and population density, diet, and habitat diversity. We defined parasites broadly to include not only parasitic helminths and arthropods but also viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, and we controlled for effects of uneven sampling effort on per-host measures of parasite diversity. In nonphylogenetic tests, body mass was correlated with total parasite diversity and the diversity of helminths and viruses. When phylogeny was taken into account, however, body mass became nonsignificant. Host population density, a key determinant of parasite spread in many epidemiological models, was associated consistently with total parasite species richness and the diversity of helminths, protozoa, and viruses tested separately. Geographic range size and day range length explained significant variation in the diversity of viruses.

TI Population mixing accelerates coevolution
AB Theory predicts that mixing in spatially structured populations of hosts and parasites can increase the rate of antagonistic coevolution. We experimentally tested this prediction by allowing populations of bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens) and parasitic bacteriophage to coevolve in mixed and unmixed microcosms. Coevolution proceeded at approximately twice the rate in mixed populations compared with unmixed populations and caused the evolution of more resistant hosts and more infective parasites.

TI Drought-induced mosquito outbreaks in wetlands
AB Mosquitoes are not only a nuisance, but also vector many important human and animal diseases. Here, in opposition with the dogma that increased precipitation predicts mosquito abundance, we hypothesize that mosquitoes should show population outbreaks after drought years. Specifically, we suggest that in wetlands that never dry (Permanent), predators limit mosquito abundance, whereas in wetlands that dry yearly (temporary), competitors that are well adapted to predictable drying, limit mosquito abundance. However, in wetlands that dry only during drought years (semi-permanent), mosquito predators and competitors are eliminated and must recolonize following a drought, and the abundance of wetland mosquitoes can skyrocket. We present supportive evidence for this hypothesis from surveys of natural wetlands and from a controlled mesocosm experiment. We conclude that this framework may provide a reliable way to predict and prepare for year-to-year variation in mosquito abundances at large spatial scales.

TI West Nile virus infection in nonhuman primate breeding colony,
   concurrent with human epidemic, southern Louisiana
AB During the summer of 2002, an epidemic of West Nile meningoencephalitis, occurred in southern Louisiana. Following the outbreak, blood samples were collected from 1,692 captive rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), pigtail macaques (M. nemestrina), and baboons (Papio spp.) that were permanently housed outdoors at a nonhuman primate breeding facility in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana. The serum samples were examined for antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV). Overall, 36% of the captive nonhuman primates had WNV antibodies; comparison of these samples with banked serum samples from previous blood collections indicated that the animals were infected subclinically from February to August 2002. WNV activity was demonstrated in surveillance at the nonhuman primate-breeding colony and in the neighboring community during this same period. The high infection rate in this captive nonhuman primate population illustrates the intensity of WNV transmission that can occur silently in nature among other susceptible vertebrates during epidemic periods.

TI Human hantavirus infections, Sweden
AB The prevalent human hantavirus disease in Sweden is nephropathia epidemica, which is caused by Puumala virus and shed by infected bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus). To evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of this disease, we studied 2,468 reported cases from a highly disease-endemic region in northern Sweden. We found that, in particular, middle-aged men living in rural dwellings near coastal areas were overrepresented. The case-patients were most often infected in late autumn, when engaged in activities near or within manmade rodent refuges. Of 862 case-patients confident about the site of virus exposure, 50% were concentrated within 5% of the study area. The incidence of nephropathia epidemica was significantly correlated with bank vole numbers within monitored rodent populations in part of the region. Understanding this relationship may help forestall future human hantavirus outbreaks.

TI Strong context-dependent virulence in a host-parasite system:
   reconciling genetic evidence with theory
AB 1. Parasites can have dramatic effects on the ecology of their hosts. Such strong host-parasite interactions are the result of either parasites with generally high virulence, or generally benign parasites that nevertheless express context-dependent virulence. Theoretically, one indication that an apparently benign parasite nevertheless has a large impact on its host should be the existence of strong genotypic interactions between host and parasite.
   2. Crithidia bombi (Trypanosomatidae) is a highly prevalent but generally benign gut parasite of the bumble-bee Bombus terrestris. The demonstration of strong genotypic interactions between C. bombi and B. terrestris, however, suggests that context-dependent virulence may have a large impact on the host population. We thus investigated the effects of C. bombi across the entire life cycle of its host, including the stressful times of hibernation and colony-founding. Owing to the high prevalence and rates of transmission of the parasite in field populations, we used a large-scale laboratory experiment.
   3. Under stressful hibernation, infected queens lost more mass. Infection also significantly reduced colony-founding success, colony size, male production and overall fitness, by up to 40%. These findings show that strong genotypic host-parasite interactions may indeed be a reliable indicator that apparently benign and highly prevalent parasites are nevertheless exerting a dramatic impact on their host populations.

TI The population dynamical implications of covert infections in
   host-microparasite interactions
AB 1. The persistence of parasites that are only seen in intermittent outbreaks has intrigued ecologists. Long the subject of speculation, there is now evidence that viral insect diseases can cause covert as well as overt infections.
   2. Typically, infection leads to overtly diseased individuals that are infectious and die as a result of the disease, but it can also produce other individuals that show a covert, non-infectious pathology, which is typically asymptomatic. Covertly infected individuals do not die as a result of infection, although they may be affected sublethally such that their reproductive output falls, they may transmit the covert infection vertically and, crucially, they may convert at some rate to overt infectious individuals. In this way the parasites are able to persist in host populations and can be detected only by the use of molecular techniques.
   3. Here, we apply novel analytical techniques to a general host-parasite modelling framework and examine the population dynamical consequences of such covert infections.
   4. The interplay between various stabilizing and destabilizing forces leads to a highly complex pattern of host dynamics, including a theoretically intriguing pinch point. Covert infections may be stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the specific characteristics of the interaction, particularly in relation to the rate of conversion from covert to overt infection.
   5. In general terms, intermediate rates of conversion are stabilizing, while high and low rates may each destabilize the host population. In contrast, there is no consistent pattern for the role of vertical transmission because, in some cases, high levels are stabilizing while in others they are destabilizing.
   6. Thus, our results demonstrate that relatively subtle pathogen effects such as covert infections can have important and novel dynamical impacts on the host-pathogen interaction. It also suggests that the effects of covert infection are likely to be system-specific and information may be required on a system-by-system basis in order to make predictions.

TI Territorial behaviour and population dynamics in red grouse Lagopus
   lagopus scoticus. I. Population experiments
AB 1. According to the 'territorial behaviour' hypothesis, population cycles of red grouse are caused by delayed density-dependent changes in the aggressiveness of territorial cocks. We report here on a replicated population experiment testing assumptions of this hypothesis.
   2. We used testosterone implants to increase aggressiveness of cocks for 3 months during autumn, when recruitment and territory establishment take place. On two moors located in northern England, and on two 1-km(2) areas within each moor, we implanted adult cocks with testosterone on an experimental area and with sham implants on a control area.
   3. During the first autumn, the testosterone treatment prevented recruitment of young cocks into the territorial populations. This reduced breeding density and altered the age ratio among territorial cocks, and possibly levels of kinship. If so, the 'kinship' hypothesis predicted that density and recruitment should continue to differ between testosterone-treated and control areas.
   4. Grouse density remained significantly lower on the experimental than on the control areas for two consecutive breeding seasons. This confirmed a strong spatial structuring within grouse populations, which prevented immigration from neighbouring higher-density areas. In the second autumn, testosterone was not implanted but the recruitment rate remained significantly lower and cock density continued to decline more on the experimental than on the control areas.
   5. The results suggest that cocks continued to be aggressive and to maintain large territories for at least a year after aggressiveness was increased experimentally, and therefore that autumn aggressiveness is influenced by previous territorial contests.
   6. The experiment validates key assumptions of the 'territorial behaviour' hypothesis for red grouse cycles. Population models in a subsequent paper demonstrate how changes in aggressiveness can cause population cycles.

TI Territorial behaviour and population dynamics in red grouse Lagopus
   lagopus scoticus. II. Population models
AB 1. Recent experiments on cyclic red grouse populations discovered that aggressiveness, induced by testosterone implants, depressed population density for more than a year after the implants were exhausted.
   2. This confirms the observation, also made in previous studies of this territorial species, that aggressiveness can determine population density. Additionally, it hints at a form of social memory that sustains the effect of episodes of high aggressiveness after their cause has ceased to exist.
   3. We explore the logical consequences of this observation with a simple model of the interaction between population density and aggressiveness. A flexible function describes how aggressiveness changes from year to year as a function of population density. At low densities animals are tolerant to conspecifics and aggressiveness falls from one year to the next. Conversely, at high densities aggressiveness rises.
   4. In the model, current aggressiveness is set by aggressiveness in the previous year, and modified by last year's population density (first version) or by current population density (second version).
   5. We assume no particular behavioural mechanism underlying this process but derive conditions under which changes in aggressiveness, effected by density, can generate unstable dynamics.
   6. The two versions of the model give fluctuations that differ in period and amplitude but have similar conditions for unstable dynamics. Specifically, the more abrupt the transition from tolerant to intolerant behaviour with increasing density, the more likely are cycles to occur.
   7. We show how a previous model of the kinship hypothesis for red grouse cycles can be recast in the current terminology, and how the new models offer a more general way of examining red grouse population dynamics.

TI Association with host mitochondrial haplotypes suggests that feminizing
   microsporidia lack horizontal transmission
AB The amphipod crustacean Gammarus duebeni hosts two feminizing microsporidian parasites, Nosema granulosis and Microsporidium sp. Samples of G. duebeni were collected from three sites on the Scottish island of Great Cumbrae and screened for microsporidia using polymerase chain reaction. Associations between the prevalence of the two feminizing parasites and haplotypes of the host mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) were investigated. The prevalence of both parasites varied significantly among the host's COI haplotypes, suggesting that horizontal transmission is rare or absent in the life cycles of the feminizing microsporidia and that all transmission must therefore be vertical. Life cycles in which all transmission is vertical are common among bacterial parasites but have never before been demonstrated in Eukaryotic parasites.

TI Humoral immune response in relation to senescence, sex and sexual
   ornamentation in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica)
AB Performance of animals may decline with age. The effects of senescence, however, may differ between the sexes because of differences in physiology and behaviour. Acquired immunity provides hosts with efficient mechanisms of anti-parasite defence, but the effect of senescence on immunocompetence has never been studied in natural populations. In the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), primary antibody response to an antigen during one breeding season declined with age in females, while secondary response during the following breeding season declined with age in both sexes. Parasite-mediated sexual selection theory posits that male secondary sexual characters reveal resistance to parasites. Males with large tail ornaments had stronger primary response, retained larger antibody levels until the following year, but did not differ in secondary response compared with short-tailed males, as predicted if ornamentation reflects resistance to parasites. This is the first study showing that immunocompetence declines with age in any vertebrate under natural conditions.

TI Interspecific hybridization in plant-associated fungi and oomycetes: a
   review
AB Fungi (kingdom Mycota) and oomycetes (kingdom Stramenopila, phylum Oomycota) are crucially important in the nutrient cycles of the world. Their interactions with plants sometimes benefit and sometimes act to the detriment of humans. Many fungi establish ecologically vital mutualisms, such as in mycorrhizal fungi that enhance nutrient acquisition, and endophytes that combat insects and other herbivores. Other fungi and many oomycetes are plant pathogens that devastate natural and agricultural populations of plant species. Studies of fungal and oomycete evolution were extraordinarily difficult until the advent of molecular phylogenetics. Over the past decade, researchers applying these new tools to fungi and oomycetes have made astounding new discoveries, among which is the potential for interspecific hybridization. Consequences of hybridization among pathogens include adaptation to new niches such as new host species, and increased or decreased virulence. Hybrid mutualists may also be better adapted to new hosts and can provide greater or more diverse benefits to host plants.

   native and introduced populations of the invasive argentine ant
   (Linepithema humile)
AB Wolbachia pipientis is a maternally transmitted bacterium that often alters the life history of its insect host to maximize transmission to subsequent generations. Here we report on the frequency and distribution of Wolbachia infection in a widespread invasive species, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We screened 1175 individual Argentine ants from 89 nests on five continents and several islands, including numerous locations in both the native (South American) and introduced ranges. We detected Wolbachia in four of 11 native populations, but only one of 21 introduced populations was infected. In the Argentine ant's native range, the distribution of Wolbachia supergroups A and B was nonoverlapping. By coupling infection frequency data with behaviourally defined colony boundaries, we show that infected and uninfected colonies are often adjacent to one another, supporting the proposition that little female-mediated gene flow occurs among Argentine ant colonies. We also conduct a phylogenetic analysis, and show that the Wolbachia infecting both native and introduced populations of Argentine ants belong to two lineages that appear to be specialized on infecting New World ants. One other lineage of Wolbachia has undergone frequent, recent episodes of horizontal transmission between distantly related, introduced insect hosts.

The KX reporter cassette (kanamycin resistance, aph, and catechol 2, 3, dioxygenase, xylE) was introduced on the disarmed transposon mini-Tn5 into: (I) the chromosome of a spontaneous rifampicin resistant mutant Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25R; (II) the chromosome of SBW25R in the presence of a naturally occurring lysogenic-phage (phage Phi101); and (III) a naturally occurring plasmid pQBR11 (330 kbp, tra+, Hg-r) introduced into SBW25R. These bacteria were applied to Stellaria media (chickweed) plants as seed dressings [c. 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/seed] and the seedlings planted in 16 microcosm chambers containing model plant and animal communities. Gene transfer to pseudomonads in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere was found only in the plasmid treatment (III). Bacteria in the phage treatment (II) initially declined in density and free phage was detected, but populations partly recovered as the plants matured. Surprisingly, bacteria in the chromosome insertion treatment (I) consistently achieved higher population densities than the unmanipulated control and other treatments. Plasmids were acquired from indigenous bacterial populations in the control and chromosome insertion treatments. Plasmid acquisition, plasmid transfer from inocula and selection for plasmid carrying inocula coincided with plant maturation.

TI Defective or effective? Mutualistic interactions between virus genotypes
AB Defective viruses lack genes essential for survival but they can co-infect with complete virus genotypes and use gene products from the complete genotype for their replication and transmission. As such, they are detrimental to the fitness of complete genotypes. Here, we describe a mutualistic interaction between genotypes of an insect baculovirus (nucleopolyhedrovirus of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera)) that increases the pathogenicity of the viral population. Mixtures of a complete genotype able to be transmitted orally and a deletion mutant unable to be transmitted orally resulted in a phenotype of increased pathogenicity. Because the infectiousness of mixed genotype infections was greater than that of single genotype infections, we predict that the transmissibility of mixed genotype occlusion bodies will be greater than that of any of their single genotype components. Such interactions will be subject to frequency-dependent selection and will influence the impact of these viruses on insect population dynamics and their efficacy as biological insecticides.

TI Range limits and parasite prevalence in a freshwater snail
AB Geographical range limits are thought to be set by species' physiological or ecological adaptation to abiotic factors, but the importance of biotic factors such as parasitism in determining range limits has not been well explored. In this study the prevalence of trematode parasitism in populations of a freshwater gastropod snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, increased sharply as this species approached its western UK range limit. The likelihood of trematode infection increased with snail size, but high prevalence at the range edge was not a result of interpopulation variation in snail size. Changes in population growth rates resulting from high rates of parasitism at the range edge could contribute to range limitation. The mechanism driving high rates of parasitism at the range edge is not clear, but changes in abiotic factors towards the range limit may influence snail life history and immune response to trematode infection, indirectly altering the prevalence of parasites in marginal host populations.

TI Immune response is energetically costly in white cabbage butterfly pupae
AB Parasite-driven coevolution has led hosts to develop a complicated and potentially costly defence machinery, consisting mainly of the immune system. Despite the evidence for the trade-offs between immune function and life-history traits, it is still obscure how the costs of using and maintaining the immune function are paid. We tested whether immune challenge is energetically costly for white cabbage butterfly (Pieris brassicae L.) diapausing pupa. Individuals challenged with nylon implant raised their standard metabolic rate nearly 8% compared to the controls. Hence, costs of activation of immune system in insect pupa can be expressed in energetic currency.

TI Facultative symbionts are associated with host plant specialization in

AB The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, shows significant reproductive isolation and host plant specialization between populations on alfalfa and clover in New York. We examine whether specialization is seen in pea aphids in California, and whether fitness on alternative host plants is associated with the presence of bacterial symbionts. We measured the fitness of alfalfa- and clover-derived aphids on both types of plants and found no evidence for specialization when all aphid lineages were considered simultaneously. We then screened all aphids for the presence of four facultative bacterial symbionts: PAR, PASS, PABS and PAUS. Aphids with PAUS were host-plant specialized, having twice as many offspring as other aphids on clover, and dying on alfalfa. Other aphids showed no evidence of specialization. Additionally, aphids with PABS had 50% more offspring than aphids with PASS when on alfalfa. Thus, specialist and generalist aphid lineages coexist, and specialization is symbiont associated. Further work will resolve whether PAUS is directly responsible for this variation in fitness or whether PAUS is incidentally associated with host-plant specialized aphid lineages.

TI Parasite removal and its impact on litter size and body condition in
   Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus)
AB The current interest in studies of parasite-host relationships is focusing on the impact of parasites on mate choice, sexual selection and individual fitness. While most studies have been done on birds and fishes, little is known about the interactions between parasites and reproductive success in mammals. In this study, I experimentally removed ectoparasites (mainly fleas) from some female Columbian ground squirrels using a commercially available powder, whereas other squirrels were left untreated as controls. The anti-parasite treatment led to an increase in female body condition during lactation and at weaning and an increase in fitter size. The increase of body mass in treated females between birth of the young and weaning is also different from observations done over 8 years in the same population, where untreated females usually lost mass. In close to 400 litters from untreated females in the same area, only 2% had litter sizes as big as the treated females. I conclude that ectoparasites can have a profound impact not only on individuals but probably on the dynamics of the whole population.

Odds ratios ( ORs) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs), for HIV acquisition, were estimated by logistic regression. HIV load was measured by RNA - polymerase chain reaction, and herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV- 2) serologic testing used HerpeSelect EIA with Western blot confirmation. The OR of HSV- 2 seropositivity associated with HIV acquisition was 1.7 ( 95% CI, 1.2 - 2.4). Prevalence of GUD was increased among case subjects, at visits 2 ( OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.9 - 5.3) and 3 ( OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 - 3.9). HIV load was increased in HSV- 2 - seropositive case subjects, compared with that in HSV- 2 - seronegative subjects, at 5 ( p = .04) and 15 (P = .02) months after seroconversion. HIV acquisition is associated with HSV- 2 seropositivity, and GUD is increased after seroconversion. HIV load is increased in HSV- 2 - positive subjects who seroconverted, suggesting a role for treatment of HSV- 2 infection in HSV- 2 - seropositive, dually infected individuals.

AB In 2000, El Salvador experienced a large dengue-2 virus epidemic with many severe cases. A seroepidemiologic survey was conducted in 106 randomly selected households (501 residents) in an affected community (Las Pampitas). The frequency of recent infection, documented by the presence of IgM antibodies or high-titer IgG antibodies to dengue virus, was estimated to be 9.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.8-13.7), of which at least 44% were secondary infections. The number of containers positive for Aedes mosquito larvae or pupae per 100 premises (Breteau Index) was 62 and the frequency of positive premises (House Index) was 36%; 33% (35 of 106) of the informants reported having taken action against mosquito larval habitats and 82% (87 of 106) reported having taken actions against adult mosquitoes. Recent infection was associated with the presence in the home environment of mosquito infested discarded cans (odds ratio [OR] = 4.30, 95% CI 2.54-7.28), infested discarded plastic containers (OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.05-15.05), and discarded tire casings (OR 2.57, 95% CI = 1.09-6.04). The population attributable fractions associated with these factors were 4%, 13%, and 31%, respectively. Our data suggest that targeted community cleanup campaigns, particularly those directed at discarded tires and solid waste, are likely to have the greatest impact on reducing the risk of dengue infection.

   epidemics
AB The rates of transmission of infection from inoculum or infecteds to susceptible hosts are critical determinants of epidemics, yet no formal experimental methods have been described for their quantification and analysis in spatially explicit epidemics. Replicated microcosms of >400 radish seedlings and with tight control of environmental conditions were exposed to known amounts of inoculum of the fungal plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Spatiotemporal maps of disease progress were used to distinguish between primary and secondary infections and to count changes with time in the number of infected plants and the number of contacts between susceptible and neighboring infected plants. Transmission rates were defined within a compartmental S-I (susceptible-infected) model for plant epidemics and estimated empirically using counts from spatial maps. The transmission rate for primary infection declined with time; the transmission rate for secondary infection rose initially and then declined. We discuss the mechanisms contributing to the changes in transmission rates with time and show that spatial mapping combined with an epidemiological analysis provides accurate empirical estimates of transmission rates.

TI Rates of spread of marine pathogens
AB Epidemics of marine pathogens can spread at extremely rapid rates. For example, herpes virus spread through pilchard populations in Australia at a rate in excess of 10 000 km year(-1), and morbillivirus infections in seals and dolphins have spread at more than 3000 km year(-1). In terrestrial environments, only the epidemics of myxomatosis and calicivirus in Australian rabbits and West Nile Virus in birds in North America have rates of spread in excess of 1000 km year(-1). The rapid rates of spread of these epidemics has been attributed to flying insect vectors, but flying vectors have not been proposed for any marine pathogen. The most likely explanation for the relatively rapid spread of marine pathogens is the lack of barriers to dispersal in some parts of the ocean, and the potential for long-term survival of pathogens outside the host. These findings caution that pathogens may pose a particularly severe problem in the ocean. There is a need to develop epidemic models capable of generating these high rates of spread and obtain more estimates of disease spread rate.

Fifteen (2%) of 912 participants in a general village cross-sectional antibody survey were positive for Marburg immunoglobulin G antibody.

Working as a miner (odds ratio [OR] 13.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1 to 62.1) and receiving injections (OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.6 to 33.2) were associated with a positive antibody result. All 103 participants in a targeted antibody survey of healthcare workers were antibody negative. Primary transmission of Marburg virus to humans likely occurred via exposure to a still unidentified reservoir in the local mines. Secondary transmission appears to be less common with Marburg virus than with Ebola virus, the other known filovirus.

The outbreak appears to have started with sewage pipeline problems near the kitchen, which caused overflow of the sewage system and contaminated the environment. While no pathogenic bacteria were found in water or stools specimens, norovirus was detected in 8 of 11 stool specimens and 2 of 3 water samples by polymerase chain reaction. Nucleotide sequencing of amplicons from two patients and two water samples identified an emerging genotype designated GGIIb, which was circulating throughout several European countries during 2000 and 2001.

To identify modes of transmission and opportunities for prevention, a case-control study was conducted and risk factors for gastroenteritis attributable to norovirus (NV), Sapporo-like virus (SLV), and rotavirus were studied. For NV gastroenteritis, having a household member with gastroenteritis, contact with a person with gastroenteritis outside the household, and poor food-handling hygiene were associated with illness (population attributable risk fractions [PAR] of 17%, 56%, and 47%, respectively). For SLV gastroenteritis, contact with a person with gastroenteritis outside the household was associated with a higher risk (PAR 60%). For rotavirus gastroenteritis, contact with a person with gastroenteritis outside the household and food-handling hygiene were associated with a higher risk (PAR 86% and 46%, respectively). Transmission of these viral pathogens occurs primarily from person to person. However, for NV gastroenteritis, foodborne transmission seems to play an important role.

EBLVs are host restricted to bats, and have been known to infect not only their primary hosts but also in rare circumstances, induce spillover infections to terrestrial mammals including domestic livestock, wildlife and man. Although spillover infections have occurred, there has been no evidence that the virus adapted to a new host. Since 1977, four human deaths from EBLVs have been reported. None of them had a record of prophylactic rabies immunization. Only fragmentary data exist about the effectiveness of current vaccines in cross-protection against EBLVs. It is clear that EBLV in bats cannot be eliminated using conventional strategies similar to the control programmes based on vaccine baits used for fox rabies in Europe during the 1980s. Due to the protected status of bats in Europe, our knowledge of EBLV prevalence and epidemiology is limited. It is possible that EBLV is under-reported and that the recorded cases of EBLV represent only a small proportion of the actual number of infected bats. For this reason, any interaction between man and bats in Europe must be considered as a possible exposure. Human exposure through biting incidents, especially unprovoked attacks, should be treated immediately with rabies post-exposure treatment and the bat, where possible, retained for laboratory analysis. Preventative measures include educating all bat handlers of the risks posed by rabies-infected animals and advising them to be immunized. This review provides a brief history of EBLVs, their distribution in host species and the public health risks.

TI Outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157 infections at multiple county
   agricultural fairs: a hazard of mixing cattle, concession stands and
   children
AB Escherichia coli O157 infections cause an estimated 60 deaths and 73 000 illnesses annually in the United States. A marked summer peak in incidence is largely unexplained. We investigated an outbreak of E. coli O157 infections at an agricultural fair in Ohio and implicated consumption of beverages made with fairground water and sold by a geographically localized group of vendors who were all on the same branch of the fairground water distribution system. To examine county fair attendance as a risk factor for infection, we conducted two further epidemiological studies. In the first, we enhanced surveillance for E. coli O157 infections in 15 Northeast Ohio counties during the 2000 agricultural fair season and showed increased risk of E. coli O157 infection among fair attendees. In the second study, we examined Ohio Public Health Laboratory Information Service (PHLIS) data for 1999 using a time-varying covariate proportional hazards model and demonstrated an association between agricultural fairs and E. coli O157 infections, by county. Agricultural fair attendance is a risk factor for E. coli O157 infection in the United States and may contribute to the summer peak in incidence. Measures are needed to reduce transmission of enteric pathogens at agricultural fairs.

TI The seroepidemiology and transmission dynamics of varicella in Australia
AB To enhance our understanding of the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of varicella in the pre-vaccine era we performed a serosurvey using opportunistically collected sera submitted to diagnostic laboratories across Australia during 1997-1999. A representative sample by state and sex of 2027 sera from persons aged 1-49 years was tested using an enzyme immunoassay method. The average age of infection and age-specific forces of infection (the probability that a susceptible individual acquires infection) were calculated using published methodologies. Seropositivity increased with age, with 83% of sera positive by ages 10-14 years. The highest force of infection was in the 5-9 years age group (0.195 per susceptible year) followed by the 0-4 years age group (0.139 per susceptible year) and the average age of infection was 8.15 years. These results provide valuable baseline information to measure the impact of vaccination and indicate that vaccination should be aimed at children less than 5 years of age, although further modelling using the serosurvey data is warranted.

TI Mosquito mortality and the evolution of malaria virulence
AB Several laboratory studies of malaria parasites (Plasmodium sp.) and some field observations suggest that parasite virulence, defined as the harm a parasite causes to its vertebrate host, is positively correlated with transmission. Given this advantage, what limits the continual evolution of higher parasite virulence? One possibility is that while more virulent strains are more infectious, they are also more lethal to mosquitoes. In this study, we tested whether the virulence of the rodent malaria parasite P. chabaudi in the laboratory mouse was correlated with the fitness of mosquitoes it subsequently infected. Mice were infected with one of seven genetically distinct clones of P. chabaudi that differ in virulence. Weight loss and anemia in infected mice were monitored for 16-17 days before Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were allowed to take a blood meat from them. Infection virulence in mice was positively correlated with transmission to mosquitoes (infection rate) and weakly associated with parasite burden (number of oocysts). Mosquito survival fell with increasing oocyst burden, but there was no overall statistically significant relationship between virulence in mice and mosquito mortality. Thus, there was no evidence that more virulent strains are more lethal to mosquitoes. Both vector survival and fecundity depended on parasite clone, and contrary to expectations, mosquitoes fed on infections more virulent to mice were more fecund. The strong parasite genetic effects associated with both fecundity and survival suggests that vector fitness could be an important selective agent shaping malaria population genetics and the evolution of phenotypes such as virulence in the vector.

TI Effect of dietary p-aminobenzoic acid on murine Plasmodium yoelii
   infection
AB Plasmodia species, unlike humans, can utilize p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for the de novo generation of folate. Plasmodial enzymes for the synthesis of PABA via the shikimate pathway are being investigated as novel targets for malaria chemotherapy. We show that, despite the presence of biosynthetic machinery to synthesize PABA, Plasmodium yoelii, a rodent malaria species, requires exogenous dietary PABA for survival. Mice fed low-PABA diets do not die from lethal doses of P. yoelii. The initiation of a PABA-deficient diet after P. yoelii infection is established leads to the clearance of parasites and subsequent resistance to infection by P. yoelii. An intact immune system is not necessary for protection, given that mice with severe combined immunodeficiency were also protected by PABA-deficient diet. Our studies suggest that the PABA content in the diet will affect the host clearance of malaria parasites and may affect the efficacy of treatments that target the shikimate pathway.

TI Phylogeography of the circumpolar Paranoplocephala arctica species
   complex (Cestoda : Anoplocephalidae) parasitizing collared lemmings
   (Dicrostonyx spp.)
AB The Paranoplocephla arctica complex (Cyclophyllidea, Anoplocephalidae), host-specific cestodes of collared lemmings Dicrostonyx, include two morphospecies P. arctica and P. alternata, whose taxonomical status now must be considered ambiguous. The genetic population structure and phylogeography of the P. arctica complex was studied from 83 individuals sampled throughout the Holarctic distribution range using 600 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI). The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeny divides the species complex into one main Nearctic and one main Palaearctic phylogroup, corresponding to the main phylogenetic division of the hosts. In the Palearctic phylogroup, the parasite clades correspond to the host clades although the parasites from Wrangel Island form an exception as the host on this island, D. groenlandicus, belongs to the Nearctic phylogroup. In the Nearctic, northern refugia beyond the ice limit of the Pleistocene glaciations are proposed for the hosts. All reconstructions of parasite phylogeny show a genetically differentiated population structure that in the Canadian Arctic lacks strict congruence between phylogeny and geography. The parasite phylogeny does not show complete congruence with host relationships, suggesting a history of colonization and secondary patterns of dispersal from Beringia into the Canadian Arctic, an event not proposed by the host phylogenies alone.

TI Pre-west nile virus outbreak: Perceptions and practices to prevent
   mosquito bites and viral encephalitis in the United States
AB Mosquitoes can transmit over 100 of the viruses that can cause encephalitis, meningitis, and hemorrhagic disease in humans (Chin 2000; Gubler 1996; Monath 1989). While much is known about the ecology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of the arboviral encephalitides (Campbell et al. 2002; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1997; Gubler 1998; Hayes 1989; Hubalek and Halouzka 1999), little empirical research exists regarding the U.S. population's knowledge of mosquitoes and arboviral encephalitis, particularly prior to the U.S. outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) in 1999. A nationally representative 55-item survey instrument was successfully administered to 1,500 adults in the United States and an additional 250 adults in six states in the Northeast (Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island) regarding mosquitoes and mosquito-borne viral encephalitis. A summary outcome measure for mosquito bite prevention was created. Analyses revealed that the following were statistically significant predictors of behaviors taken to prevent mosquito bites: being concerned about being bitten by mosquitoes, perceived effectiveness of staying indoors in late afternoon and early evening was protective, perceived effectiveness that mosquito repellent is not harmful to health, owning dogs and/or cats as pets, being married, and being greater than or equal to18-44 years old. Being concerned about being bitten by mosquitoes was the most robust predictor of behavioral action to prevent mosquito bites (OR = 7.3; 95% CI = 4.3, 12.2). Observed misperceptions and inadequate knowledge regarding insect repellents suggest increased promotion of the safety and efficacy of DEET-containing insect repellents is warranted.

TI Evaluation of a prototype Ehrlichia chaffeensis surveillance system
   using white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as natural sentinels
AB The natural history of Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the causative agent of human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, includes the lone star tick (LST, Amblyomma americanum) as a vector and white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) as both a natural reservoir of E. chaffeensis and a major host of LST. The goal of the current study was to implement and evaluate a prototype surveillance system to delineate the geographic distribution of E. chaffeensis using WTD as natural sentinels. To accomplish this goal, serologic testing using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test was performed on WTD serum samples, and to confirm serologic results, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and culture isolation were conducted. Considerations relevant to the applicability of a surveillance system utilizing WTD were analyzed (e.g., age and gender relationships to serologic status, adequacy of sample sizes needed to distinguish between uninfected and infected populations, presence of LST, and ability to detect stability and spread of E. chaffeensis in WTD populations). Of 3275 WTD serologically tested, 549 (47%) from 17 of 18 states had antibodies reactive to E. chaffeensis (IFA titer greater than or equal to 1:128). No difference between age groups or gender was noted with serologic testing, thus these variables would not be a concern for a surveillance system using WTD. Significantly more deer in younger age groups (less than or equal to1.5 yr) were PCR and culture positive, and 46% of 122 seropositive WTD populations were confirmed positive by PCR or culture isolation. A significant association between LST infestation and E. chaffeensis seroreactivity was noted. Furthermore, the surveillance system was able to detect stability of E. chaffeensis within WTD populations and also spread to new populations, both of which were associated with LST status. These data clearly demonstrate that WTD are useful as natural sentinels for this emerging human pathogen, and establish a prototypical framework for a WTD surveillance system.

TI Adaptive innate immunity? Responsive-mode prophylaxis in the mealworm
   beetle, Tenebrio molitor
AB A primary infection by a parasite may indicate a higher risk of being reinfected in the near future (since infection may indicate that enemies are becoming more abundant). Acquired immunity does not exist in invertebrates despite the fact that they also face increased risks of reinfection following primary exposure. However, when subjected to immune insult, insects can produce immune responses that persist for long enough to provide prophylaxis. Because these immune responses are costly, persistence must be maintained through a selective advantage. We tested for the possibility that these long-lasting immune responses provided increased resistance to later infections by experimentally mimicking a primary immune insult (pre-challenge) in larvae of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prior to early or late exposure to spores of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. We found that pre-challenged larvae produced a long-lasting antimicrobial response, which provided a survival benefit when the larvae were exposed to fungal infection. These results suggest that the observed response is functionally 'adaptive'.

TI Changing partners in an obligate symbiosis: a facultative endosymbiont
   can compensate for loss of the essential endosymbiont Buchnera in an
   aphid
AB Almost all aphids harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium, Buchnera aphidicola, in bacteriocytes. Buchnera synthesizes essential nutrients and supports growth and reproduction of the host. Over the long history of endosymbiosis, many essential genes have been lost from the Buchnera genome, resulting in drastic genome reduction and the inability to live outside the host cells. In turn, when deprived of Buchnera, the host aphid suffers retarded growth and sterility. Buchnera and the host aphid are often referred to as highly integrated almost inseparable mutualistic partners. However, we discovered that, even after complete elimination of Buchnera, infection with a facultative endosymbiotic gamma-proteobacterium called pea aphid secondary symbiont (PASS) enabled survival and reproduction of the pea aphid. In the Buchnera-free aphid, PASS infected the cytoplasms of bacteriocytes that normally harbour Buchnera, establishing a novel endosymbiotic system. These results indicate that PASS can compensate for the essential role of Buchnera by physiologically and cytologically taking over the symbiotic niche. By contrast, PASS negatively affected the growth and reproduction of normal host aphids by suppressing the essential symbiont Buchnera. These findings illuminate complex symbiont-symbiont and host-symbiont interactions in an endosymbiotic system, and suggest a possible evolutionary route to novel obligate endosymbiosis by way of facultative endosymbiotic associations.

TI Molecular analysis of Plasmodium falciparum recrudescent malaria
   infections in children treated with chloroquine in Nigeria
AB Parasite genotyping by a polymerase chain reaction was used to distinguish recrudescent from newly acquired Plasmodium falciparum infections in 50 of 160 Nigerian children taking part in a chloroquine efficacy study in Ibadan, Nigeria. A finger prick blood sample was taken from each child before and after treatment to identify recrudescent parasites. By investigating allelic variation in three polymorphic antigen loci, merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), MSP-2, and glutamate-rich protein (GLURP), we determined parasite diversity in the population and in the infected host. DNA from pretreatment and post-treatment samples from 47 of the 50 patients who failed therapy was successfully amplified by the PCR. The MSP-1, MSP-2, and GLURP genotypes in all samples showed extensive diversity, indicating polyclonal infections. The average number of clones per infection in pre-treatment sample was 2.5 with MSP-1, 4.9 with MSP-2, and 2 with GLURP. The extent of multiplicity decreased significantly (P = 0.016) in post-treatment samples. Multiplicity of infection and initial parasite density were not age dependent. Comparison of the variant alleles in pretreatment and post-treatment samples of each patient indicates that 26 of the 47 children had genuinely recrudescent disease. Conversely, post-treatment samples from five children showed completely new genotypes, indicating either a previously sequestered population of parasites or a newly acquired infection. Overall, this study has shown the diversity and complexity of P. falciparum population in Ibadan, Nigeria. The study has also shown the dynamics of P. falciparum infections in this population before and after chloroquine treatment in an area of high malaria transmission.

TI Phytohormones and plant-herbivore-pathogen interactions: Integrating the
   molecular with the ecological
AB Current research into indirect phytopathogen-herbivore interactions (i.e., interactions mediated by the host plant) is carried out in two largely independent directions: ecological/mechanistic and molecular. We investigate the origin of these approaches and their strengths and weaknesses. Ecological studies have determined the effect of herbivores and phytopathogens on their host plants and are often correlative: the need for long-term manipulative experiments is pressing. Molecular/cellular studies have concentrated on the role of signaling pathways for systemic induced resistance, mainly involving salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, and more recently the cross-talk between these pathways. This crosstalk demonstrates how interactions between signaling mechanisms and phytohormones could mediate plant-herbivore-pathogen interactions. A bridge between these approaches may be provided by field studies using chemical induction of defense, or investigating whole-organism mechanisms of interactions among the three species. To determine the role of phytohormones in induced resistance in the field, researchers must combine ecological and molecular methods. We discuss how these methods can be integrated and present the concept of "kaleidoscopic defense." Our recent molecular-level investigations of intern actions between the herbivore Gastrophysa viridula and the rust fungus Uromyces rumicis on Rumex obtusifolius, which were well studied at the mechanistic and ecological levels, illustrate the difficulty in combining these different approaches. We suggest that the choice of the right study system (possibly wild relatives of model species) is important, and that molecular studies must consider the environmental conditions under which experiments are performed. The generalization of molecular predictions to ecologically realistic settings will be facilitated by "middle-ground studies" concentrating on the outcomes of the interactions.

TI Effects of vector behavior and host resistance on mistletoe aggregation
AB Understanding the factors affecting parasite aggregation in natural host populations is one of the central questions in parasite ecology. While different biological mechanisms giving rise to aggregation have been documented in the literature, the role of established parasites in vector attraction, and its importance in determining clumped parasite distributions has received-less attention. In a two-year field study, we evaluated the importance of a bird vector, Mimus thenca (Mimidae), on the aggregation dynamics of the holoparasitic mistletoe, Tristerix aphyllus, on its cactus host, Echinopsis chilensis. Removal of T. aphyllus from cacti decreased the number of visits and the time spent by the bird vector, which resulted in a 3.5-fold lower seed deposition of the mistletoe on experimental hosts than on control hosts. Vector preference, however, was not the only factor affecting aggregation in this system. Spine length of the cactus acted as a first line of defense against parasitism, by discouraging bird perching on top of host columns. While heavily parasitized hosts received more seeds than unparasitized hosts, spines counteracted this effect. These results provide field evidence that parasite aggregation results from the balance between vector behavior and host resistance traits.

TI Transmission of Salmonella between broiler chickens fed with fermented
   liquid feed
AB In the light of food safety and the control of Salmonella at chicken farms, fermented liquid feed (FLF) was Studied. This moistened feed reduced the Susceptibility of chickens for Salmonella. To assess the effect of the fermented feed on the transmission of Salmonella between chickens, a transmission experiment was performed. Salmonella shedding was followed within groups of two susceptible chickens together with two previously inoculated chickens. The between-chicken transmission was quantified by calculating a reproduction ratio (R-0) and a transmission rate parameter (beta). R-0 and beta in the FLF-treated groups were reduced, but a typical infectious chicken fed with FLF, Could on average still infect more than one new infectious case. FLF can therefore reduce the transmission of Salmonella in chicken flocks, but it will not prevent the occurrence of major outbreaks.

TI Life cycles shape parasite evolution: Comparative population genetics of
   salmon trematodes
AB Little is known about what controls effective sizes and migration rates among parasite populations. Such data are important given the medical, veterinary, and economic (e.g., fisheries) impacts of many parasites. The autogenic-allogenic hypothesis, which describes ecological patterns of parasite distribution, provided the foundation on which we studied the effects of life cycles on the distribution of genetic variation within and among parasite populations. The hypothesis states that parasites cycling only in freshwater hosts (autogenic life cycle) will be more limited in their dispersal ability among aquatic habitats than parasites cycling through freshwater and terrestrial hosts (allogenic life cycle). By extending this hypothesis to the level of intraspecific genetic variation, we examined the effects of host dispersal on parasite gene flow. Our a priori prediction was that for a given geographic range, autogenic parasites would have lower gene flow among subpopulations. We compared intraspecific mitochondrial DNA variation for three described species of trematodes that infect salmonid fishes. As predicted, autogenic species had much more highly structured populations and much lower gene flow among subpopulations than an allogenic species sampled from the same locations. In addition, a cryptic species was identified for one of the autogenic trematodes. These results show how variation in life cycles can shape parasite evolution by predisposing them to vastly different genetic structures. Thus, we propose that knowledge of parasite life cycles will help predict important evolutionary processes such as speciation, coevolution, and the spread of drug resistance.

TI Host reproduction and a sexually transmitted disease: causes and
   consequences of Coccipolipus hippodamiae distribution on coccinellid
   beetles
AB 1. We know that sexually transmitted parasites and pathogens have extremely deleterious effects in human and domesticated animal populations, but know little of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in natural populations.
   2. One previously reported natural system is the sexually transmitted mite, Coccipolipus hippodamiae, on the eastern European coccinellid, Adalia bipunctata. Our aims were to determine how widespread this parasite is in terms of incidence and prevalence across host species, to identify the causes of the prevalence pattern and whether the parasite reduces fertility in all host species.
   3. Coccipolipus hippodamiae was present on four of 19 European species examined. The wide distribution and high prevalence of C. hippodamiae on A. bipunctata indicates that this is the major host. The mite was also present at substantial prevalence on Adalia decempunctata and at lower prevalence on Synharmonia (=Oenopia) conglobata and Calvia quatuordecimguttata.
   4. Laboratory studies on mite development time and transmission efficiency revealed that although physiological factors may affect incidence, they do not explain prevalence variation between hosts, but characteristics of host life history and reproductive behaviour are important in this context. Adalia bipunctata is more promiscuous than the less commonly infected A. decempunctata and S. conglobata. Diapause is needed before breeding will occur in C. quatuordecimguttata, leading to a lack of the consistent sexual activity between generations, which is needed for STD maintenance. Calvia quatuordecimguttata is probably periodically reinfected through hybrid matings with other host species.
   5. Coccipolipus hippodamiae infection has similar strong deleterious effects on female reproduction in A. decempunctata and S. conglobata as have previously been demonstrated in A. bipunctata.
   6. The results indicate that STDs may play a profound role in the ecology of promiscuous insect populations with overlapping generations. Here they may reach significant prevalence whilst exhibiting extreme virulence.

TI The dynamics of virus epidemics in Varroa-infested honey bee colonies
AB 1. When the parasitic mite Varroa jumped species from the eastern to the western honey bee, millions of infested bee colonies died. Recent work has revealed that the probable cause of this collapse is that mites provide a new route of transmission, by acting as a vector, for certain bee viruses.
   2. Using a mathematical model parameterized by recently collected data on bee viruses, we investigate the relationship between the mite load in a colony and the possibility of a virus epidemic occurring within a bee colony.
   3. The model suggests that the balance of coexistence between mite, virus and bee in the eastern honey bee, has been lost in the western bee host, not simply because of the new transmission route, but also because mite populations in western honey bee colonies has exceeded a critical epidemic threshold. We quantify the critical epidemic mite load for two well-studied bee viruses, acute paralysis virus and deformed wing virus, through the colony's yearly life cycle.
   4. As well as providing practical insights into mite control strategies, the model allows us to disentangle the relative importance of different bee and mite behaviours in virus spread. We consider the evolutionary aspects of the new route of virus transmission, looking in particular at how changes to social organization might bring about collective resistance.

TI Effects of host condition on susceptibility to infection, parasite
   developmental rate, and parasite transmission in a snail-trematode
   interaction
AB Whether or not organisms become infected by parasites is likely to be a complex interplay between host and parasite genotypes, as well as the physiological condition of both species. Details of this interplay are very important because physiology-driven susceptibility has the potential to confound genetic coevolutionary responses. Here we concentrate on how physiological aspects of infection may interfere with genetic-based infectivity in a snail-trematode (Potamopyrgus antipodarum/Microphallus sp.) interaction by asking: (1) how does host condition affect susceptibility to infection? and (2) how does host condition affect the survival of infected individuals? We manipulated host condition by experimentally varying resources. Contrary to our expectation, host condition did not affect susceptibility to infection, suggesting that genetics are more important than physiology in this regard. However, hosts in poor condition had higher parasite-induced mortality than hosts in good condition. Taken together, these results suggest that coevolutionary interactions with parasites may depend on host condition, not by altering susceptibility, but rather by affecting the likelihood of parasite transmission.

TI The effect of spatial heterogeneity and parasites on the evolution of
   host diversity
AB Both spatial heterogeneity and exploiters (parasites and predators) have been implicated as key ecological factors driving population diversification. However, it is unclear how these factors interact. We addressed this question using the common plant-colonizing bacterium Pseudomonas fluoreseens, which has been shown to diversify rapidly into spatial niche-specialist genotypes when propagated in laboratory microcosms. Replicate populations were evolved in spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous environments (shaken and static microcosms, respectively) with and without viral parasites (bacteriophage) for approximately 60 bacterial generations. Consistent with previous findings, exploiters reduced diversity in heterogeneous environments by relaxing the intensity of resource competition. By contrast, exploiters increased diversity in homogeneous environments where there was little diversification through resource competition. Competition experiments revealed this increase in diversity to be the result of fitness trade-offs between exploiter resistance and competitive ability. In both environments, exploiters increased allopatric diversity, presumably as a result of divergent selection for resistance between populations. Phage increased total diversity in homogeneous environments, but had no net effect in heterogeneous environments. Such interactions between key ecological variables need to be considered when addressing diversification and coexistence in future studies.

   with HIV: A phylogenetic analysis
AB To describe the spread of hepatitis C virus (HCV) among HCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected injection drug users (IDUs), the molecular epidemiology of HCV was studied among 108 IDUs from 7 European countries. Phylogenetic analysis based on the NS5B region showed great sequence variation of HCV within each country and no clear phylogenetic clustering by geographic region. The most prevalent subtypes were 1a and 3a, but the percentage of genotype 4 was also relatively high, ranging from 7% in northern Europe to 24% in southern Europe. Genotype 4 consisted mainly of subtype 4d and has entered the majority of the IDU populations studied. The significantly lower evolutionary distances within subtype 4d suggest that this subtype may have entered the European IDU population relatively recently. In conclusion, HCV exchange between European IDU populations has occurred on a large scale, and, overall, country-specific clustering for HCV was less than that shown for HIV.

AB We examined the association between host factors present near the time of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition and subsequent virus loads, in a prospective cohort study of women in Mombasa, Kenya. Women were prospectively followed monthly before HIV-1 infection. One hundred sixty-one commercial sex workers who became infected with HIV-1 were followed for a median of 34 months, and 991 plasma samples collected greater than or equal to4 months after infection were tested for HIV-1 RNA. The median virus set point at 4 months after infection was 4.46 log(10) copies/mL, and the average virus load increase during subsequent follow-up was 0.0094 log(10) copies/mL/month. In a multivariate analysis that controlled for sexual behavior, the use of the injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) at the time of HIV-1 infection was associated with a higher virus set point, and the presence of genital ulcer disease (GUD) during the early phase of HIV-1 infection was associated with greater change in virus load during follow-up. These findings suggest that, in women, the use of DMPA and the presence of GUD during the early phase of HIV-1 infection may influence the natural course of infection.

TI Major histocompatibility complex diversity influences parasite
   resistance and innate immunity in sticklebacks
AB Proteins of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a central role in the presentation of antigens to the adaptive immune system. The MHC also influences the odour-based choice of mates in humans and several animal taxa. It has recently been shown that female three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) aim at a moderately high MHC diversity in their offspring when choosing a mate. Do they optimize the immune systems of their offspring? Using three-spined sticklebacks that varied in their individual numbers of MHC class IIB molecules, we tested, experimentally, whether allelic diversity at the MHC influences parasite resistance and immune parameters. We found that sticklebacks with low MHC diversity suffered more from parasite infection after experimental exposure to Schistocephalus solidus tapeworms and Glugea anomala microsporidians. They also showed the highest proportion of granulocytes and the strongest respiratory burst reaction, which are correlates of innate immunity. This indicates a strong activity of the innate immune system after challenge by parasites when MHC diversity is suboptimal. Individuals with very high allelic diversity at the MHC seemed inferior to those with moderately high diversity. Such a pattern is consistent with theoretical expectations of an optimal balance between the number of recognizable antigens and self-tolerance.

TI Fraction of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome prevented by the

AB Previous research has demonstrated isolated effects of host genetic factors on the progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In this paper, the authors present a novel use of multivariable methods for estimating the prevented fraction of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases attributable to six restriction genes after accounting for their epidemiologic interactions. The methods presented will never yield a prevented fraction above 1. The study population consisted of a well-characterized cohort of 525 US men with HIV-1 seroconversion documented during follow-up (1984-1996). On the basis of a regression tree approach using a Cox proportional hazards model for times to clinical AIDS, the combinations of genes associated with the greatest protection, relative to the lack of a protective genotype, consisted of: 1) C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-Delta32 and C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-64I (relative hazard = 0.44); 2) interleukin 10 (IL10)-+/+ in combination with CCR5-Delta32 or CCR2-64I (relative hazard = 0.45); and 3) IL10-+/+ in combination with stromal-derived factor (SDF1)-3 'A and CCR5 promoter P1/similar toP1 (relative hazard = 0.37). Overall, 30% of potential AIDS cases were prevented by the observed combinations of restriction genes (95% confidence interval: 7, 47). However, the combined effect was confined to the first 4 years following HIV-1 seroconversion. Additional research is needed to identify AIDS restriction genes with stronger and long-lasting protection to better characterize the genetic epidemiology of HIV-1.

AB A large proportion of people with latent tuberculosis live in malaria-endemic areas, so co-infection with these two organisms is likely to be common. To determine whether there might be a biologic interaction between these two pathogens in vivo, we infected mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and then with a non-lethal strain of Plasmodium yoelii eight weeks later. Mice chronically infected with M. tuberculosis simulate the equilibrium between pathogen and host thought to exist in human latent infection. Co-infected mice were less able to contain growth of M. tuberculosis in lung, spleen, and liver (mean +/- SEM log(10) colony-forming units = 5.50 +/- 0.11 versus 5.12 +/- 0.08, 4.58 +/- 0.07 versus 4.13 +/- 0.10, and 2.86 +/- 0.10 versus 2.49 +/- 0.10, respectively) and had increased mortality. In populations where both diseases are endemic, there may be implications for increased incidence of clinically detectable tuberculosis.

TI A randomized clinical trial comparing single- and multi-dose combination
   therapy with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole for treatment of
   bancroftian filariasis
AB The Global Program for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis calls for mass drug administration for endemic populations outside of sub-Saharan Africa with a single dose of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole (Alb) annually for 4-6 years. Single-dose DEC/Alb dramatically reduces blood microfilaria (MF) counts, but most treated subjects fail to completely clear MF after a single dose. A more effective regimen might reduce the number of years required for elimination programs. We performed a randomized clinical trial in Egyptian adults with asymptomatic microfilaremia to compare treatment with seven daily doses of oral DEC (6 mg/kg) and Alb (400 mg) with a single dose of the same combination. We also studied the effect of re-treatment with single-dose DEC/Alb 12 months after the first treatment course. Multi-dose DEC/Alb was significantly more effective than single-dose therapy for reducing and clearing microfilaremia (mean reduction in MF/ml relative to pretreatment counts at 12 months, 99.6% versus 85.7%, with complete clearance in 75% versus 23.1%). The two regimens had similar activity against adult filarial worms, as indicated by serial ultrasound assessments. Neither regimen resulted in complete clearance of filarial antigenemia. There was no difference in adverse events, which were mild to moderate. Blood microfilaria and parasite antigen clearance rates increased following re-treatment. Multi-dose DEC/Alb may be a useful option for filariasis elimination programs, especially in the first year (when enthusiasm for mass drug administration and coverage rates are high), to quickly reduce community MF loads and transmission rates.

TI The evolutionary economics of immunity
AB How much of its resources should an individual invest in a costly immune system? In this article, we apply an evolutionarily stable strategy analysis to an epidemic model to answer this question. On the one hand, an investment in immune function confers protection to infectious agents by reducing host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, or the length of the infectious period. On the other hand, an immune system is costly since it absorbs resources that otherwise might be invested in increasing the host's fertility or longevity. In addition, an active immune system may be able to clear pathogens efficiently but at the same time may result in immunopathology. By means of a reproductive value approach, we show how to compare the costs and benefits of an immune system systematically and how to derive the evolutionarily stable level of immune function. We then apply these methods to various plausible scenarios. The analysis reveals that the relationship between the life span of an organism and the optimal level of investment in immune function is less straight-forward than one might expect. First, the prevalence of infection is reduced to the lowest possible level only under special circumstances. Second, members of a long-lived species do not necessarily have to invest more in immune function than those of a short-lived species. in fact, the opposite may be true. Third, the outcome of evolution can be contingent on the initial conditions. Depending on its initial investment strategy, a population may evolve to a state where very much or almost nothing is invested in a costly immune system.

TI Intraspecific reservoirs: Complex life history and the persistence of a
   lethal ranavirus
AB Virulent parasites cannot persist in small host populations unless the parasite also has a reservoir host. We hypothesize that, in hosts with complex life histories, one stage may act as an intraspecific reservoir for another. In amphibians, for example, larvae often occur at high densities, but these densities are ephemeral and fixed in space, whereas metamorphs are long-lived and vagile but may be very sparse. Parasite persistence is unlikely in either stage alone, but transmission between stages could maintain virulent parasites in seasonally fluctuating amphibian populations.
   We examined this hypothesis with a lethal ranavirus, Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), that causes recurrent epidemics in larval tiger salamander populations, but which has no reservoir host and degrades quickly in the environment. Although exposure to ATV is generally lethal, larvae and metamorphs maintained sublethal, transmissible infections for >5 mo. Field data corroborate the persistence of ATV between epidemics in sublethally infected metamorphs. Three-quarters of dispersing metamorphs during one epidemic were infected, and apparently healthy metamorphs returning,to breed harbored ATV infections. Our results suggest that larval epidemics amplify virus prevalence and sublethally infected metamorphs (re)introduce the virus into uninfected larval populations. Intraspecific reservoirs may explain the persistence of parasites in and declines of small, isolated amphibian populations.

TI The role of host sex in parasite dynamics: field experiments on the
   yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis
AB We investigated the role of host sex in parasite transmission and questioned: 'Is host sex important in influencing the dynamics of infection in free living animal populations?' We experimentally reduced the helminth community of either males or females in a yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) population using an anthelmintic, in replicated trapping areas, and subsequently monitored the prevalence and intensity of macroparasites in the untreated sex. We focussed on the dominant parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus and found that reducing parasites in males caused a consistent reduction of parasitic intensity in females, estimated through faecal egg counts, but the removal of parasites in females had no significant influence on the parasites in males. This finding suggests that males are responsible for driving the parasite infection in the host population and females may play a relatively trivial role. The possible mechanisms promoting such patterns are discussed.

Two regions of HAV RNA were amplified, sequenced, and used for phylogenetic analysis. Of 156 cases, strains of 104 isolates (66.6%) clustered into 3 genotypes: 1A, 1B, and 3. Two separate transmission circles occurred, without mutual interrelation. In genotype 1A, 4 clusters occurred in men having sex with men (MSM), and the fifth cluster was related to a virus from Morocco. In genotype 1B, 6 small clusters were directly related to the Moroccan virus. In genotype 3, strains were related to a virus from Pakistan. Our analysis indicates that, to stop transmission of HAV in Amsterdam, the entire MSM population and travelers to countries where HAV is endemic, especially children, should be vaccinated. Prevention strategies need not include the vaccination of all children living in Amsterdam.

AB The historical and contemporary population genetic structure of the chickpea Ascochyta blight pathogen, Ascochyta rabiei (teleomorph: Didymella rabiei), was determined in the US Pacific Northwest (PNW) using 17 putative AFLP loci, four genetically characterized, sequence-tagged microsatellite loci (STMS) and the mating type locus (MAT). A single multilocus genotype of A. rabiei (MAT1-1) was detected in 1983, which represented the first recorded appearance of Ascochyta blight of chickpea in the PNW. During the following year many additional alleles, including the other mating type allele (MAT1-2), were detected. By 1987, all alleles currently found in the PNW had been introduced. Highly significant genetic differentiation was detected among contemporary subpopulations from different hosts and geographical locations indicating restricted gene flow and/or genetic drift occurring within and among subpopulations and possible selection by host cultivar. Two distinct populations were inferred with high posterior probability which correlated to host of origin and date of sample using Bayesian model-based population structure analyses of multilocus genotypes. Allele frequencies, genotype distributions and population assignment probabilities were significantly different between the historical and contemporary samples of isolates and between isolates sampled from a resistance screening nursery and those sampled from commercial chickpea fields. A random mating model could not be rejected in any subpopulation, indicating the importance of the sexual stage of the fungus both as a source of primary inoculum for Ascochyta blight epidemics and potentially adaptive genotypic diversity.

TI Antigenic diversity in maxadilan, a salivary protein from the sand fly
   vector of American visceral leishmaniasis
AB The salivary protein maxadilan (MAX) is a vasodilator and immunomodulator from the sand fly vector of the protozoan parasite Leishmania chagasi. Vaccinating BALB/c mice with sand fly salivary gland extracts or with MAX protects the host against L. major infection. Because of the potential use of MAX in an anti-Leishmania vaccine, we characterized the vertebrate host IgG response to MAX in the present study. Our immunochemical analysis indicated that antibodies to MAX were detected in BALB/c mice, as well as in pigs and humans, from a area in Nicaragua endemic for Lutzomyia longipalpis. Previous studies demonstrate that the MAX protein is polymorphic on the amino acid level. Our findings suggested that naturally occurring MAX variants were recognized specifically by the host immune system and antigenicity appeared to be associated with amino-acid sequence variability. Thus, antigenic diversity of MAX and possibly of other arthropod salivary proteins may dictate the development of vector-based vaccines(s).

TI Wounding: The primary mode of Seoul virus transmission among male Norway
   rats
AB In rodent populations, males are more likely to be infected with hantaviruses and to engage in aggression than are females. To assess the relationship between aggression and Seoul virus infection, Norway rats were trapped in Baltimore, Maryland and wounding, infection status, and steroid hormone concentrations were examined. Older males and males with high-grade wounds were more likely to have IgG antibody to Seoul, to shed virus in saliva, urine, and feces, and to have viral RNA in organs than either juveniles or adult males with less severe wounds. In contrast, neither age nor wounding predicted virus shedding among females. Although viral antigen was not identified in the brain, viral protein was detected in the gonads and adrenal glands of adult males. Males with more severe wounds had higher testosterone concentrations than males with no or low-grade wounds. Because wounding, testosterone, and virus shedding are associated among males, aggression may be the primary mode of Seoul virus transmission among male, but not female, Norway rats.

TI Host starvation decreases parasite load and mean host size in
   experimental populations
AB While host stress in vertebrate populations has often been linked to outbreaks of epidemics, which are attributed to the immuno-compromise of the stressed hosts, no predictions have been made about the response of invertebrate host populations to stressful conditions. Experiments conducted on individual invertebrate hosts, however, suggest that starved hosts may be a poor resource for parasites and that heavily infected old hosts may be more susceptible to stress, causing parasite populations to decline when their host population faces food shortages. In this epidemiological experiment, we exposed infected and uninfected Daphnia magna populations, which had been kept for many generations under a constant high food supply, to reduced food resources. Using the, microsporidian gut parasite Glugoides intestinalis, which is exclusively horizontally transmitted, we tracked changes in parasite and host population size as well as host body length to elucidate how food shortages for the hosts influence host and parasite population dynamics. In both infected and uninfected populations, food shortage led to an approximately equal reduction in host density and changes in host body length distribution. Large hosts suffered a higher mortality than smaller hosts, which significantly reduced the mean body length in the host populations; however, this change was stronger in the infected populations and went hand in-hand with a reduction in parasite spore load (a measure of intensity of infection) and prevalence. This effect disappeared after six weeks of food shortage, when the populations reached a new equilibrium. Our results indicate that in this system food stress impairs parasite spread and that host mortality is an important factor in regulating parasite abundance at the population level.

TI Evolution of multihost parasites
AB Multihost parasites can infect different types of hosts or even different host species. Epidemiological models have shown the importance of the diversity of potential hosts for understanding the dynamics of infectious disease (e.g., the importance of reservoirs), but the consequences of this diversity for virulence and transmission evolution remain largely overlooked. Here, I present a general theoretical framework for the study of life-history evolution of multihost parasites. This analysis highlights the importance of epidemiology (the relative quality and quantity of different types of infected hosts) and between-trait constraints (both within and between different hosts) to parasite evolution. I illustrate these effects in different transmission scenarios under the simplifying assumption that parasites can infect only two types of hosts. These simple but contrasted evolutionary scenarios yield new insights into virulence evolution and the evolution of transmission routes among different hosts. Because many of the pathogens that have large public-health and agricultural impacts have complex life cycles, an understanding of their evolutionary dynamics could hold substantial benefits for management.

TI Parasitism increases and decreases the costs of insecticide resistance
   in mosquitoes
AB Adaptations conferring resistance to xenobiotics (antibiotics, insecticides, herbicides, etc.) are often costly to the organism's fitness in the absence of the selecting agent. In such conditions, and unless other mutations compensate for the costs of resistance, sensitive individuals are expected to out-reproduce resistant individuals and drive resistance alleles to a low frequency, with the rate and magnitude of this decline being proportional to the costs of resistance. However, this evolutionary dynamic is open to modification by other sources of selection acting on the relative fitness of susceptible and resistant individuals. Here we show parasitism not only as a source of selection capable of modifying the costs of organophosphate insecticide resistance in mosquitoes, but also that qualitatively different interactions (increasing or decreasing the relative fitness of resistant individuals) occurred depending on the particular form of resistance involved. As estimates of the parasite's fitness also varied according to its host's form of resistance, our data illustrate the potential for epidemiological feedbacks to influence the strength and direction of selection acting on resistance mutations in untreated environments.

TI Ecological genetics of abdominal pigmentation in Drosophila falleni: A
   pleiotropic link to nematode parasitism
AB Drosophila falleni belongs to the quinaria species group, whose species vary considerably in patterns of wing and abdominal pigmentation. Drosophila falleni itself exhibits substantial variation among wild flies in abdominal spotting patterns. A selection experiment revealed that natural populations of D. falleni harbor high levels of genetic variation for spot number; in 10 generations of selection modal spot number within populations declined from 18 (the modal number in wild-caught females) to as low as zero. Rearing flies at different temperatures shows that some of the variation among wild flies is likely to reflect variation in the environmental conditions under which they developed. Fitness assays did not reveal any cost of reduced spot number with respect to development time, adult survival, or female fecundity. However, spotless flies were almost twice as susceptible to infection by the nematode parasite Howardula aoronymphium. Thus, selection exerted by nematode parasites may influence pigmentation patterns and other. genetically correlated traits in natural populations D. falleni.

TI Density-dependent prophylaxis and condition-dependent immune function in
   Lepidopteran larvae: a multivariate approach
AB 1. The risk of parasitism and infectious disease is expected to increase with population density as a consequence of positive density-dependent transmission rates. Therefore, species that encounter large fluctuations in population density are predicted to exhibit plasticity in their immune system, such that investment in costly immune defences is adjusted to match the probability of exposure to parasites and pathogens (i.e. density-dependent prophylaxis).
   2. Despite growing evidence that insects in high-density populations show the predicted increase in resistance to certain pathogens, few studies have examined the underlying alteration in immune function. As many of these species show increased cuticular melanism at high densities, the aim of this study was to use a multivariate approach to quantify relative variation in the allocation of resources to immunity associated with both rearing density (solitary vs. crowded) and cuticular colour (pale vs. dark) in a phase-polyphenic Lepidopteran species (Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval).
   3. Relative to pale individuals, dark larvae (the high-density phenotype) exhibited higher haemolymph and cuticular phenoloxidase (PO) activity and a stronger melanotic encapsulation response to an artificial parasite inserted into the haemocoel. However, they also exhibited lower antibacterial (lysozyme-like) activity than pale larvae. Larval density per se had little effect on most of the immune parameters measured, though capsule melanization and antibacterial activity were significantly higher in solitary-reared than crowded larvae.
   4. Correcting for variation in larval body condition, as estimated by weight and haemolymph protein levels, had little effect on these results, suggesting that variation in immune function across treatment groups cannot be explained by condition-dependence. These results are examined in relation to pathogen resistance, and the possibility of a trade-off within the immune system is discussed.

TI Seasonal dynamics of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in eastern North
   American house finches
AB 1. Mycoplasma gallisepticum is an emerging eye disease that spread rapidly among wild house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) in the eastern United States following initial reports of infected birds in 1994. The hallmark signs of infection have allowed systematic monitoring of disease at both local and continent-wide scales for more than 7 years since the onset of the epidemic.
   2. Using data collected by a network of citizen science volunteers, we examined both long-term trends and seasonal dynamics of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in three different climatic regions in eastern North America over a 77-month period (November 1994-March 2001).
   3. Time-series prevalence data from all three regions suggest that following establishment, marked seasonal fluctuations in prevalence each year were characterized by autumn-winter epidemics (in October and February) and consistent summer declines (with prevalence falling close to zero from May to July).
   4. The maximum peak, annual rates of increase and timing of epidemics varied among three geographical locations that were delineated by minimum winter temperatures. Annual autumn prevalence in the South increased more rapidly, and maximum prevalence was nearly three times greater in the South than in the colder North and Central regions.
   5. Longer-term trends showed evidence for multiyear fluctuations in prevalence that were characterized by greater amplitude in the southern region.
   6. Finally, monthly estimates of house finch flock sizes derived from a similar citizen science data set showed that winter flock sizes were associated positively with average monthly prevalence in the northern and central regions, although regional differences in flock sizes did not correspond to regional differences in maximum prevalence.
   7. This study represents the first evidence of multiyear fluctuations, regional differences and highly predictable annual outbreaks of this recently emerged wildlife pathogen. Several factors associated with house finch life history and behaviour are likely to contribute to temporal and spatial variation in prevalence, including annual changes in host reproduction, social behaviour and environmental effects on host stress or immunocompetence.

TI What maintains noncytoplasmic incompatibility inducing Wolbachia in
   their hosts: a case study from a natural Drosophila yakuba population
AB Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) allows Wolbachia to invade hosts populations by specifically inducing sterility in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. In some species, non-CI inducing Wolbachia, that are thought to derive from CI-inducing ancestors, are common. In theory, the maintenance of such infections is not possible unless the bacterium is perfectly transmitted to offspring - and/or provides a fitness benefit to infected females. The present study aims to test this view by investigating a population of Drosophila yakuba from Gabon, West Africa. We did not find any evidence for CI using wild caught females. Infected females from the field transmitted the infection to 100% of their offspring. A positive effect on female fecundity was observed one generation after collecting, but this was not retrieved five generations later, using additional lines. Similarly, the presence of Wolbachia was found to affect mating behaviour, but the results of two experiments realized five generations apart were not consistent. Finally, Wolbachia was not found to affect sex ratio. Overall, our results would suggest that Wolbachia behaves like a neutral or nearly neutral trait in this species, and is maintained in the host by perfect maternal transmission.

TI Immune system paralysis by anthrax lethal toxin: the roles of innate and
   adaptive immunity
AB Since the deliberate use of anthrax as a bioweapon in the USA in 2001, an enormous amount of attention has been focused on the biology of Bacillus anthracis, the causative bacterium of anthrax. Fatal systemic anthrax involves massive bacteraemia and toxaemia with non-descript early symptoms until the onset of shock and sudden death. The outbreak of fatal symptoms after the incubation period of B anthracis suggests an impairment of the host immune system against this pathogen. Thus, it is likely that B anthracis will posess certain strategies to escape from the host immune system. However, the mechanisms of such immune-evasion strategies are not fully characterised yet. Given the critical role of B anthracis toxins in anthrax pathogenesis, much effort has been made to understand the pathological nature of the toxins. Recent studies have shown the pleiotropic actions of anthrax lethal toxin on host innate immune cells, and that several effects of anthrax lethal toxin may directly account for the mechanism of immune intervention by B anthracis.

TI Gene flow in the endophyte Neotyphodium and implications for coevolution
   with Festuca arizonica
AB Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) often harbours asymptomatic, asexual endophytic fungi from the genus Neotyphodium. In agronomic grasses, Neotyphodium endophytes are often credited with a wide range of mutualistic benefits to its host many of which are related to fungal production of alkaloids for herbivore deterrence. Neotyphodium in the native grass Arizona fescue, however, usually produces alkaloids at levels too low to deter herbivores, and in general, does not behave mutualistically. This study uses microsatellite markers to examine rates of gene flow among four Arizona populations of Neotyphodium. Haplotypic diversity was generally low; only one population contained more than two haplotypes. Haplotypes carrying multiple loci for some or all of the microsatellite loci were also found, indicating a vegetative hybridization event between Neotyphodium and the grass choke pathogen from the genus Epichloe. Gene flow between Neotyphodium populations is very low, and likely much lower than the pollen mediated gene flow of its host. These differing rates of gene flow are predicted to create trait mismatching between endophyte and host and may explain the low, or lack of, alkaloid production by Neotyphodium in Arizona fescue and other native grass species.

In the present study, the density of questing Ixodes ricinus ticks and their infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) was examined in 11 areas located on the Swiss Plateau and in an alpine valley. From 1999 to 2001, free-living I. ricinus ticks were collected on a monthly basis by flagging vegetation in these areas. Each tick was examined for the presence of B. burgdorferi A using direct fluorescent antibody assay, and for isolation of the bacteria. Borreliae were characterized by PCR followed by RFLP. Density of questing ticks varied greatly between studied areas. Borreliae were observed in ticks collected in all investigated sites. However, the prevalence of infection differed significantly among areas. Infection prevalence varied from 9% to 40% in nymphs and from 22% to 47% in adults. Adult ticks were significantly more infected (129/366, 35%) than nymphs (109/552, 20%). There was no correlation between nymphal density and infection prevalence as well as between adult density and infection prevalence, but there was a correlation between density of ticks and density of infected ticks. During the spring peak of questing tick density, a range of 2-30.3 infected ticks per 100 m(2) was observed. B. burgdorferi sl isolates (n = 129) were obtained from ticks collected in 10/11 areas. Five Borrelia species were identifed: B. garinii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana, B. lusitaniae, and six mixed infections were also obtained. Borrelia species were heterogeneously distributed in the different areas.

TI Mapping Rift Valley Fever vectors and prevalence using rainfall
   variations
AB High activity of the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus is related to a tremendous increase of associated mosquito vectors, which follows periods of high rainfall. Indeed, rainfall creates an ecologically humid environment that insures the proliferation of breeding sites and the development of RVF vectors. Data collected by Fontenille et al. (1998) from 1991 to 1996 in the Barkedji area in the northern Senegal are employed to discuss and quantify the incidence of rainfall upon the abundances of RVF vectors. We have constructed a non-linear mapping of vector abundances versus rainfall variations, and developed a stochastic model and a corresponding algorithm allowing on output the simulation of RVF mosquito vectors as a function of rainfall trajectories in the course of time. This stochastic mapping of vector abundance is subsequently used to assess the prevalence of RVF in a population of susceptible hosts as a consequence of rainfall.

TI Temporal stability of insular avian malarial parasite communities
AB Avian malaria is caused by a diverse community of genetically differentiated parasites of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus. Rapid seasonal and annual antigenic allele turnover resulting from selection by host immune systems, as observed in some parasite populations infecting humans, may extend analogously to dynamic species compositions within communities of avian malarial parasites. To address this issue, we examined the stability of avian malarial parasite lineages across multiple time-scales within two insular host communities. Parasite communities in Puerto Rico and St Lucia included 20 and 14 genetically distinct parasite lineages, respectively. Lineage composition of the parasite community in Puerto Rico did not vary seasonally or over a 1 year interval. However, over intervals approaching a decade, the avian communities of both islands experienced an apparent loss or gain of one malarial parasite lineage, indicating the potential for relatively frequent lineage turnover. Patterns of temporal variation of parasite lineages in this study suggest periodic colonization and extinction events driven by a combination of host-specific immune responses, competition between lineages and drift. However, the occasional and ecologically dynamic lineage turnover exhibited by insular avian parasite communities is not as rapid as antigenic allele turnover within populations of human malaria.

We develop a single-season susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model of WN cross-infection between birds and mosquitoes, incorporating specific features unique to WN ecology. We obtain the disease reproduction number, R-0, and show that mosquito control decreases, but bird control increases, the chance of an outbreak. We provide a simple new analytical and graphical method for determining, from standard public health indicators, necessary mosquito control levels. We extend this method to a seasonally variable mosquito population and outline a multi-year model framework. The model's numerical simulations predict disease levels that are consistent with independent data.

TI Natural interspecific and intraspecific horizontal transfer of
   parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia in Trichogramma wasps
AB The intracellular bacterium Wolbachia is one of the most common symbionts in arthropods and, because of its manipulative effects on host reproduction, is assumed to be an important factor in several evolutionary processes. These bacteria are mainly vertically transmitted from mother to daughter through the egg cytoplasm, and horizontal transmission is generally assumed to be rare. Here, we show natural inter- and intraspecific horizontal transfer of parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia between parasitoid wasps of the genus Dichogramma. Horizontal transfer was observed when infected and uninfected larvae shared the same host egg. This is the first report, to our knowledge, on interspecific horizontal transfer of Wolbachia between closely related sympatric species. Some originally uninfected immature wasps acquired Wolbachia while inside the host egg, but not all of these newly infected females exhibited the parthenogenesis phenotype. In general, intraspecific horizontal transfer was more successful than interspecific transfer. Wolbachia underwent vertical transmission in the new species but the infection tended to be lost within several generations. Our results have important implications for understanding the evolution of Wolbachia-host associations.

TI Antigen genes for molecular epidemiology of leishmaniasis: Polymorphism
   of cysteine proteinase B and surface metalloprotease glycoprotein 63 in
   the Leishmania donovani complex
AB Background. Efficient monitoring of endemic and resurgent visceral leishmaniasis (VL) requires discriminatory molecular tools that allow direct characterization of etiological agents (i.e., the Leishmania donovani complex) in host tissues. This characterization is possible through restriction fragment-length polymorphism ( RFLP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified sequences (PCR-RFLP).
   Methods. We present 2 new PCR-RFLP assays that target the gene locus of cysteine proteinase B (cpb), an important Leishmania antigen. The assays were applied to the characterization of 15 reference strains of the L. donovani complex, and their discriminatory power was compared with that of PCR-RFLP analysis of the gp63 gene, another Leishmania antigen, and with that of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), which is the reference standard for parasite typing.
   Results. Restriction patterns of the cpb locus were polymorphic, but less so than gp63 patterns. When data for both loci were combined, differences between PCR-RFLP and MLEE results were encountered. Antigen gene analysis was more discriminatory and supported a different classification of parasites, one that fitted with their geographic origin. PCR-RFLP analysis of cpb also allowed direct genotyping of parasites in bone marrow aspirate and venous blood samples obtained from patients with VL.
   Conclusion. Antigen genes constitute valid targets for PCR-based Leishmania typing without the need for isolation of parasites.

TI Frequency-dependent incidence in models of sexually transmitted
   diseases: portrayal of pair-based transmission and effects of illness on
   contact behaviour
AB We explore the transmission process for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). We derive the classical frequency-dependent incidence mechanistically from a pair-formation model, using an approximation that applies to populations with rapid pairing dynamics (such as core groups or non-pair-bonding animals). This mechanistic derivation provides a framework to assess how accurately frequency-dependent incidence portrays the pair-based transmission known to underlie STD dynamics. This accuracy depends strongly on the disease being studied: frequency-dependent formulations are more suitable for chronic less-transmissible infections than for transient highly transmissible infections. Our results thus support earlier proposals to divide STDs into these two functional classes, and we suggest guidelines to help assess under what conditions each class can be appropriately modelled using frequency-dependent incidence. We then extend the derivation to include situations where infected individuals exhibit altered pairing behaviour. For four cases of increasing behavioural complexity, analytic expressions are presented for the generalized frequency-dependent incidence rate, basic reproductive number (R-0) and steady-state prevalence (i(infinity)) of an epidemic. The expression for R-0 is identical for all cases, giving refined insights into determinants of invasibility of STDs. Potentially significant effects of infection-induced changes in contact behaviour are illustrated by simulating epidemics of bacterial and viral STDs. We discuss the application of our results to STDs (in humans and animals) and other infectious diseases.

AB A high temperature stress of 44.5 degreesC for 10 minutes on the larval stages was found to affect the susceptibility of adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to chikungunya virus. At this temperature, the mortality of the mosquito larvae was found to be approximately 95%, whereas a temperature greater than 45 degreesC for to minutes was found to be lethal. A temperature tolerant (TT) strain was developed by exposing the larvae to a temperature of 44.5 degreesC for 10 minutes at every generation for five generations. This strain was established to determine whether increase in the susceptibility was due to any selection pressure of higher temperature or to the influence of other intrinsic factors such as expression of immunoresponsive (IR) genes. Other studies on these mosquito strains showed that when maintained at 28 +/- 1degreesC, there was no difference in the larval duration and mortality in the immature stages, but the mean survival of female mosquitoes in the TT strain was 5-6 days longer. Conversely, when mosquitoes were maintained throughout at 37 degreesC the mean survival of' the mosquitoes decreased drastically in both strains, but the mean survival of females in the TT strain was 5-6 days longer compared with the unstressed controls. This increases the probability of at least one more blood meal. Fecundity of the TT strain was found to be lower than that of the control mosquitoes. Data suggest that expression of certain IR genes was affected by the heat shock. Sonic of these genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, which may have affected the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the virus. Although there was some selection in the temperature-tolerant individuals in the TT strain. when stressed by heat they showed expression of IR genes in a pattern similar to that in the normal controls. It appears that an increase in temperature above the average temperature of an area might help increase the proportion of virus-susceptible mosquitoes in the population. Such in increase in temperature in an endemic area would not only enhance the selection of temperature-tolerant individuals in a population having more longevity, but would also affect both intrinsic and extrinsic factors by reducing the extrinsic incubation period and increasing susceptibility of mosquitoes to viruses due to affected expression of IR genes.

TI A general theory for the evolutionary dynamics of virulence
AB Most theory on the evolution of virulence is based on a game-theoretic approach. One potential shortcoming of this approach is that it does not allow the prediction of the evolutionary dynamics of virulence. Such dynamics are of interest for several reasons: for experimental tests of theory, for the development of useful virulence management protocols, and for understanding virulence evolution in situations where the epidemiological dynamics never reach equilibrium and/or when evolutionary change occurs on a timescale comparable to that of the epidemiological dynamics. Here we present a general theory similar to that of quantitative genetics in evolutionary biology that allows for the easy construction of models that include both within-host mutation as well as superinfection and that is capable of predicting both the short- and long-term evolution of virulence. We illustrate the generality and intuitive appeal of the theory through a series of examples showing how it can lead to transparent interpretations of the selective forces governing virulence evolution. It also leads to novel predictions that are not possible using the game-theoretic approach. The general theory can be used to model the evolution of other pathogen traits as well.

TI Dengue spatial and temporal patterns, French Guiana, 2001
AB To study a 2001 dengue fever outbreak in Iracoubo, French Guiana, we recorded the location of all patients' homes and the date when symptoms were first observed. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to integrate the patient-related information. The Knox test, a classic space-time analysis technique, was used to detect spatiotemporal clustering. Analysis of the relative-risk (RR) variations when space and time distances vary, highlighted the maximum space and time extent of a dengue transmission focus. The results show that heterogeneity in the RR variations in space and time corresponds to known entomologic and epidemiologic factors, such as the mosquito feeding cycle and host-seeking behavior. This finding demonstrates the relevance and potential of the use of GIS and spatial statistics for elaborating a dengue fever surveillance strategy.

AB To date, investigations of Pneumocystis jirovecii circulation in the human reservoir through the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) locus analysis have only been conducted by examining P. jirovecii isolates from immunosuppressed patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Our study identifies P. jirovecii genotypes at this locus in 33 immunocompetent infants colonized with P. jirovecii contemporaneously with a bronchiolitis episode and in 13 adults with PCP; both groups of patients were monitored in Amiens, France. The results have pointed out identical features of P jirovecii DHPS genotypes in the two groups, suggesting that in these groups, transmission cycles of P. jirovecii infections are linked. If these two groups represent sentinel populations for P. jirovecii infections, our results suggest that all persons parasitized by P. jirovecii, whatever their risk factor for infection and the form of parasitism they have, act as interwoven circulation networks of P jirovecii.

TI Genome properties and the limits of adaptation in bacteriophages
AB Eight bacteriophages were adapted for rapid growth under similar conditions to compare their evolved, endpoint fitnesses. Four pairs of related phages were used, including two RNA phages with small genomes (MS2 and Qbeta), two single-stranded DNA phages with small genomes (phiX174 and G4), two T-odd phages with medium-sized, double-stranded DNA genomes (T7 and T3), and two T-even phages with large, double-stranded DNA genomes (T6 and RB69). Fitness was measured as absolute growth rate per hour under the same conditions used for adaptation. T7 and T3 achieved the highest fitnesses, able to increase by 13 billionfold and three-quarters billionfold per hour, respectively. In contrast, the RNA phages achieved low fitness maxima, with growth rates approximately 400-fold and 4000-fold per hour. The highest fitness limits were not attributable to high mutation rates or small genome size, even though both traits are expected to enhance adaptation for fast growth. We suggest that major differences in fitness limits stem from different "global" constraints, determined by the organization and composition of the phage genome affecting whether and how it overcomes potentially rate-limiting host processes, such as transcription, translation, and replication. Adsorption rates were also measured on the evolved phages. No consistent pattern of adsorption rate and fitness was observed across the four different types of phages, but within each pair of related phages, higher adsorption was associated with higher fitness. Different adsorption rate limits within pairs may stem from "local" constraints-sequence differences leading to different local optima in the sequence space.

TI Haplodiploidy as an outcome of coevolution between male-killing
   cytoplasmic elements and their hosts
AB Haplodiploidy (encompassing both arrhenotoky and paternal genome elimination) could have originated from coevolution between male-killing endosymbiotic bacteria and their hosts. In insects, haplodiploidy tends to arise in lineages that rely on maternally transmitted bacteria for nutrition and that have gregarious broods in which competition between siblings may occur. When siblings compete, there is strong selection on maternally transmitted elements to kill males. I consider a hypothetical bacterial phenotype that renders male zygotes effectively haploid by preventing chromosome decondensation in male-determining sperm nuclei. By causing high male mortality, such a phenotype can be advantageous to the bacterial lineage. By eliminating paternal genes, it can also be advantageous to the host female. A simple model shows that the host female will benefit under a wide range of values for the efficiency of resource re-allocation, the efficiency of transmission, and the viability of haploid males. This hypothesis helps to explain the ecological correlates of the origins of haplodiploidy, as well as such otherwise puzzling phenomena as obligate cannibalism by male Micromalthus beetles, reversion to diploidy by aposymbiotic male stictococcid scale insects, and the bizarre genomic constitution of scale insect bacteriomes.

   infections, in a general-population cohort of Rakai, Uganda
AB Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RNA loads were determined for 256 subjects with early ( incident) HIV infection and for 1293 subjects with later ( prevalent) HIV infection, in a Ugandan cohort. Prevalent infections were classified as latent ( 0 - 1 symptoms) and midstage disease (greater than or equal to2 symptoms), and deaths were ascribed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Among subjects with incident HIV infection, HIV load did not differ by sex, but, among subjects with prevalent HIV infection, it was higher in males than in females. HIV load was highest in subjects ( 25 - 29 years old) with incident HIV infection but increased with age in subjects with prevalent HIV infection. Viremia was higher after serconversion than in latency and increased with more advanced disease. Viremia was increased with genital ulcer disease (GUD) in both subjects with incident infection and in those with prevalent infection, and with herpes simplex virus type 2 seropositivity in subjects with incident HIV infection. GUD was consistently associated with higher HIV loads in subjects with incident and those with prevalent HIV infection, suggesting that treatment of GUD might reduce HIV viremia.

TI Mathematical modelling and the control of lymphatic filariasis
AB The current global initiative to eliminate lymphatic filariasis represents one of the largest mass drug administration programmes ever conceived for the control of a parasitic disease. Yet, it is still not known whether the WHO-recommended primary strategy of applying annual single-dose mass chemotherapy with a combination of two drugs for 4-6 years will effectively break parasite transmission from all endemic communities. Here we review recent work on the development and application of a deterministic mathematical model of filariasis transmission, to show how models of parasite transmission will help resolve the key currently debated questions regarding the ultimate effectiveness of the global strategy to control filariasis. These critical questions include the required duration of mass treatment in different endemic areas, the optimal drug coverage required to meet control targets within prescribed timeframes, the impact and importance of adding vector control to mass chemotherapy regimens, and the likelihood of the development of drug resistance by treated worm populations. The results demonstrate the vital role that integrating these models into control programming can have in providing effective decision-support frameworks for undertaking the optimal design and monitoring of regional and global filariasis-control programmes. Operationally, the models show that the effectiveness of the strategy to achieve filariasis control will be determined by successfully addressing two key factors: the need to maintain high community treatment coverages, and the need to include vector control measures especially in areas of high endemicity.

TI The phylogeography of human viruses
AB Viruses, especially those with RNA genomes, represent ideal organisms to study the dynamics of microevolutionary change. In particular, their rapid rate of nucleotide substitution means that the epidemiological processes that shape their diversity act on the same time-scale as mutations are fixed in viral populations. Consequently, the branching structure of virus phylogenies provides a unique insight into spatial and temporal dynamics. Herein, I describe the key processes in virus phylogeography. These are generally associated with the relative rates of dispersal among populations and virus-host codivergence (vicariance), and the division between acute (short-term) and persistent (long-term) infections. These processes will be illustrated by important human viruses - HIV, dengue, rabies, polyomavirus JC and human papillomavirus - which display varying spatial and temporal structures and virus-host relationships. Key research questions for the future will also be established.

TI The evolution of resistance through costly acquired immunity
AB We examine the evolutionary dynamics of resistance to parasites through acquired immunity. Resistance can be achieved through the innate mechanisms of avoidance of infection and reduced pathogenicity once infected, through recovery from infection and through remaining immune to infection: acquired immunity. We assume that each of these mechanisms is costly to the host and find that the evolutionary dynamics of innate immunity in hosts that also have acquired immunity are quantitatively the same as in hosts that possess only innate immunity. However, compared with resistance through avoidance or recovery, there is less likely to be polymorphism in the length of acquired immunity within populations. Long-lived organisms that can recover at intermediate rates faced with fast-transmitting pathogens that cause intermediate pathogenicity (mortality of infected individuals) are most likely to evolve long-lived acquired immunity. Our work emphasizes that because whether or not acquired immunity is beneficial depends on the characteristics of the disease, organisms may be selected to only develop acquired immunity to some of the diseases that they encounter.

TI Disease dynamics in cyclic populations of field voles (Microtus
   agrestis): cowpox virus and vole tuberculosis (Mycobacterium microti)
AB The possible role of pathogens in rodent population cycles has been largely neglected since Elton's 'epidemic hypothesis' of 1931. To revisit this question, 12 adjacent, cyclic but out-of-phase populations of field roles (Microtus agrestis) in North East England were studied and the initial results are presented here. The prevalences of antibodies to cowpox virus and of clinical signs of Mycobacterium microti infection (vole tuberculosis) showed delayed (not direct) density dependence (with a lag of three to six months). This did not result from changes in population structure, even though there were such changes associated with the different phases of the cycle. The prevalences rose as vole numbers rose, and peaked as numbers declined. The apparent lag in the numerical response of infection prevalence to changes in host abundance is consistent with the hypothesis that diseases, singly or in combination, play a hitherto underestimated role in the dynamics of cyclic populations.

   carriage rates in the East Nusatenggara Province of Indonesia
AB The efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was evaluated in 89 subjects greater than one year of age with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the East Nusatenggara Province of Indonesia. Fever clearance time was longer in the SP group than in the CQ group. However, parasite clearance time was extended in subjects who received CQ compared with those who received SP. Major adverse events were not observed in either group, and no hospitalizations were required during the study. Treatment failure rates at day 28 were 69% for CQ and 8.5% for SP. In both treatment groups, gametocytemia developed during the follow-up period, but was more pronounced in the SP group, peaking at 94% on day 7. Regardless of treatment group, children < 10 years of age had significantly higher treatment failure rates than subjects 10 years of age (relative risk = 2.49), suggesting that acquired immunity influenced treatment outcomes in the presence of parasite drug resistance. Although a highly effective alternative to CQ for clearing infection, SP treatment also presented some potential drawbacks (e.g., increased and persistent gametocytemia). Replacement of CQ with SP as a first-line therapy, either alone or in combination with CQ, in those areas of Indonesia with high levels of CQ resistance should significantly improve treatment outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations lacking clinical immunity. More efficacious and rapidly acting asexual stage treatments are generally associated with increased gametocyte clearance and combination therapy in areas where drug resistance is high or emerging may provide an additional means for reducing transmission.

TI Predicting Triatoma dimidiata abundance and infection rate: A risk map
   for natural transmission of Chagas disease in the Yucatan Peninsula of
   Mexico
AB Chagas disease, a major public health problem in Latin America, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by hematophageous insects from the Triatominae subfamily. Control of this disease is based on domestic vector control with insecticides and improvements in housing. As with other vector-borne diseases, the identification of areas of high risk of disease transmission is a major prerequisite for the planning and implementation of cost-effective control programs. In this study, we explored the relationship between Triatoma dimidiata geographic distribution and bioclimatic factors in the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, using geographic information systems, and developed predictive models of T. dimidiata domestic abundance and of its infection rates by T. cruzi. These predictions were then used to build the first natural transmission risk map for Chagas disease in the Yucatan peninsula, a tool that should prove very valuable for the implementation of effective vector control programs in the region.

For disease systems in which weather-related variables affect pathogen proliferation, dispersal, or transmission, the potential for disease forecasting exists. We present a seasonal forecast of St. Louis encephalitis virus transmission in Indian River County, Florida. We derive an empiric relationship between modeled land surface wetness and levels of SLEV transmission in humans. We then use these data to forecast SLEV transmission with a seasonal lead.

This study demonstrates how weather and climate forecast skill-verification analyses may be applied to test the predictability of an empiric disease forecast model.

TI Determining the optimal developmental route of Strongyloides ratti: An
   evolutionarily stable strategy approach
AB Understanding the processes that drive parasite evolution is crucial to the development of management programs that sustain long-term, effective control of infectious disease in the face of parasite adaptation. Here we present a novel evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) model of the developmental decisions of a nematode parasite, Strongyloides ratti. The genus Strongyloides exhibits an unusual developmental plasticity such that progeny from an individual may either develop via a direct (homogonic) route, where the developing larvae are infective to new hosts, or an indirect (heterogonic) route, where the larvae develop into free-living, dioecious adults that undergo at least one bout of sexual reproduction outside the host, before producing offspring that develop into infective larvae. The model correctly predicts a number of observed features of the parasite's behavior and shows that this plasticity may be adaptive such that pure homogonic development, pure heterogonic development, or a mixed strategy may be optimal depending on the prevailing environmental conditions, both within and outside the host. Importantly, our results depend only on the benefits of an extra round of reproduction in the environment external to the host and not on benefits to sexual reproduction through the purging of deleterious mutation or the generation of novel, favorable genotypes. The ESS framework presented here provides a powerful, general approach to predict how macroparasites, the agents of many of the world's most important infectious diseases, will evolve in response to the various selection pressures imposed by different control regimes in the future.

TI Parasites make male pipefish careless
AB Parasite-mediated sexual selection is expected to favour the avoidance of matings with infected individuals. However, the extent to which the costs and benefits of discriminating against parasitized mates trade off may depend upon numerous factors. I investigated the effects of sex and infection status on choosiness in sex-role reversed deep-snouted pipefish (Syngnathus typhle L.) that were either artificially infected with the trematode parasite Cryptocotyle sp. or sham-infected. Sham-infected males were significantly more likely to associate with a sham-infected female rather than with a Cryptocotyle-infected female. infected males failed to discriminate against infected potential partners. Males were choosier the larger they were relative to the females available for choice. Females were not discriminatory, regardless of their infection status. Given an inverse relation between female fecundity and parasite load, choosy unparasitized males may gain enhanced reproductive success from their choice decisions. In contrast, more heavily infected wild-caught males gave birth to slightly fewer, but not smaller offspring than did uninfected or lightly infected males, suggesting only a low direct premium on choosy females. The detrimental effects of parasitism on male choosiness, and the lack of female discrimination against infected males likely have profound repercussions on the strength of sexual selection acting on the two sexes and on the dynamics of host-parasite interactions in this system.

TI Wolbachia affects oviposition and mating behaviour of its spider mite
   host
AB Wolbachia bacteria are transmitted from mother to offspring via the cytoplasm of the egg. When mated to males infected with Wolbachia bacteria, uninfected females produce unviable offspring, a phenomenon called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Current theory predicts that 'sterilization' of uninfected females by infected males confers a fitness advantage to Wolbachia in infected females. When the infection is above a threshold frequency in a panmictic population, CI reduces the fitness of uninfected females below that of infected females and, consequently, the proportion of infected hosts increases. CI is a mechanism that benefits the bacteria but, apparently, not the host. The host could benefit from avoiding incompatible mates. Parasite load and disease resistance are known to be involved in mate choice. Can Wolbachia also be implicated in reproductive behaviour? We used the two-spotted spider mite-Wolbachia symbiosis to address this question. Our results suggest that uninfected females preferably mate to uninfected males while infected females aggregate their offspring, thereby promoting sib mating. Our data agrees with other results that hosts of Wolbachia do not necessarily behave as innocent bystanders-host mechanisms that avoid CI can evolve.

TI Measles surveillance in the United States: An overview
AB The elimination of endemic measles from the United States has been a national goal since the introduction of measles vaccine, and measles surveillance has been crucial to guide the elimination efforts. The United States surveillance system is geared towards detection of measles virus transmission, rapid discovery of measles outbreaks to facilitate outbreak control, and identification of risk factors for measles. The surveillance system is a passive reporting system that, when activated by a reported case of suspected measles, triggers a search for additional cases around the reported case. Cases are typically reported by health care providers or from schools and day care centers. The sensitivity of the system is increased through reporting and investigation of all suspected measles cases by means of an inclusive case definition (generalized maculopapular rash and fever), and the specificity is increased through laboratory testing for measles of all suspected cases.

TI Measles surveillance in 5 major US cities: Chicago, Houston, Los
   Angeles, Miami, and New York
AB Endemic measles, if it occurs in the United States, will likely be found in cities, because large populations are required to sustain transmission and importations of measles virus are most frequent in cities. We investigated measles surveillance systems in 5 cities ( Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City) during 1995-1999. The passive reporting of a measles case activated the systems to look for more cases and to intervene to prevent more cases. During 1995-1999, 1363 suspected measles cases were investigated. Only 58 of these were confirmed as measles (0.24 cases/100,000 people), and the majority (57%) of confirmed cases were imported or linked to an importation. Most (83%) suspected cases that met the case definition had a complete case investigation, including a laboratory test for measles. We conclude that surveillance in these 5 cities shows no evidence of endemic measles transmission.

The remaining 178 (33%) "unknown-source" cases were analyzed as potential evidence of endemic measles transmission. A total of 83 counties (2.6% of the 3140 US counties) in 27 states reported unknown-source cases; 49 counties reported only 1 unknown-source case, and the maximum reported by any county was 10. Nationally, unknown-source cases were reported in 103 of the 260 weeks. The largest unknown-source outbreak included 13 cases and lasted 5 weeks. The rarity of unknown-source cases, wide gaps in geographic and temporal distribution, and the short duration of the longest unknown-source outbreak indicate that endemic transmission of measles was not sustained in the United States during this period.

Implications of measles elimination in the United States for global measles control and regional elimination efforts include demonstration of the high vaccination coverage and, in turn, population immunity needed for elimination; the importance of accurate monitoring of vaccination coverage at local, state, and national levels; a vaccination strategy that includes at least 2 opportunities for measles immunization; and the essential role of integrated epidemiological and laboratory surveillance. The United States, with a population of 288 million, is, to our knowledge, the largest country to have ended endemic measles transmission. This experience provides evidence that sustained interruption of transmission can be achieved in large geographic areas, suggesting the feasibility of global eradication of measles.

TI Genetic diversity and Wolbachia infection of the Drosophila parasitoid
   Leptopilina clavipes in western Europe
AB Wolbachia are maternally transmitted bacteria that alter their arthropod hosts' reproduction in various ways, including parthenogenesis induction (PI). Wolbachia-induced parthenogenesis can have drastic effects on the genetic structure of its host because it potentially reduces populations to clones without genetic exchange. However, Wolbachia-induced parthenogenesis does not inevitably result in a reduction of genetic variation of infected populations vs. uninfected populations, because the parthenogenetic populations are initially derived from uninfected populations and can thus show similar genetic variation. Here we investigate these issues in infected and uninfected populations of the Drosophila parasitoid Leptopilina clavipes in western Europe. Wasps from 19 sites in the Netherlands, France and northern Spain were screened for Wolbachia and analysed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. All the populations from the Netherlands and mid-France were infected with the same two strains of Wolbachia, whereas populations from the Pyrenees were not infected. The infected and uninfected populations show identical levels of genetic variation, but have clearly diverged genetically, indicating the presence of a barrier that prevents gene flow. Within the infected wasps two distinct genotypes were found at multiple localities, indicating the coexistence of multiple clones. The conditions promoting clonal coexistence in L. clavipes are discussed.

AB When syphilis first appeared in Europe in 1495, it was an acute and extremely unpleasant disease. After only a few years it was less severe than it once was, and it changed over the next 50 years into a milder, chronic disease. The severe early symptoms may have been the result of the disease being introduced into a new host population without any resistance mechanisms, but the change in virulence is most likely to have happened because of selection favouring milder strains of the pathogen. The symptoms of the virulent early disease were both debilitating and obvious to potential sexual partners of the infected, and strains that caused less obvious or painful symptoms would have enjoyed a higher transmission rate.

TI A strong association between immune responsiveness and natal dispersal
   in a songbird
AB Because parasite faunas typically show considerable spatio-temporal variation, and because parasites can have important fitness consequences, host defence mechanisms, including the immune system, can be expected to coevolve with natal dispersal, i.e. the movement of a newborn individual from its site of birth to its first site of reproduction. We demonstrate that immigrant individuals show a significantly higher humoral immune response towards a novel antigen than do local recruits in two independent populations of the great tit (Parus major). There was no effect of age, sex, tarsus length or body mass on immune responsiveness. Our results are consistent with the idea that phenotype-dependent dispersal and/or dispersal-by-phenotype-dependent selection establish a relation between immune responsiveness and natal dispersal.

TI Brief but efficient: Acute HIV infection and the sexual transmission of
   HIV
AB Background. We examined whether viral dynamics in the genital tract during the natural history of acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection could explain efficient heterosexual transmission of HIV.
   Methods. We measured HIV-1 concentration in blood and semen samples from patients with acute and long-term HIV-1 infection. We explored the effect of changes in viral dynamics in semen on the probability of transmission per coital act, using a probabilistic model published elsewhere.
   Results. Considered over time from infection, semen HIV-1 concentrations, in men with acute infection, increase and decrease in approximate parallel with changes occurring in blood. Modeling suggests that these acute dynamics alone are sufficient to increase probability of heterosexual transmission by 8 - 10-fold between peak ( day 20 after infection, based on the model) and virologic set points ( day 54 and later after infection). Depending on the frequency of coitus, men with average semen HIV-1 loads and without sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) would be expected to infect 7% - 24% of susceptible female sex partners during the first 2 months of infection. The predicted infection rate would be much higher when either partner has an STD.
   Conclusions. Empirical biological data strongly support the hypothesis that sexual transmission by acutely infected individuals has a disproportionate effect on the spread of HIV-1 infection. Acute hyperinfectiousness may, in part, explain the current pandemic in heterosexual individuals.

TI Evolution of the human ABO polymorphism by two complementary selective
   pressures
AB The best-known example of terminal-glycan variation is the ABO histo-blood group polymorphism in humans. We model two selective forces acting on histo-blood group antigens that may account for this polymorphism. The first is generated by the invasion of opportunistic bacterial or other pathogens that interact with the epithelial-mucosal surfaces. The bacteria adapt to the microenvironments of common host phenotypes and so create frequency-dependent selection for rarer host alleles. The second is generated by intracellular viruses, and accounts for the observed differentials between the ABO-phenotype frequencies. It is thought that viruses acquire histo-blood group structures as part of their envelope from their previous host. The presence of host antigens on the viral envelope causes differential transmission of the virus between host types owing to the asymmetric action of ABO natural antibodies. Our model simulations show that these two forces acting together can account for the major features of the ABO polymorphism in humans.

TI Host heterogeneity is a determinant of competitive exclusion or
   coexistence in genetically diverse malaria infections
AB During an infection, malaria parasites compete for limited amounts of food and enemy-free space. Competition affects parasite growth rate, transmission and virulence, and is thus important for parasite evolution. Much evolutionary theory assumes that virulent clones outgrow avirulent ones, favouring the evolution of higher virulence. We infected laboratory mice with a mixture of two Plasmodium chabaudi clones: one virulent, the other avirulent. Using real-time quantitative PCR to track the two parasite clones over the course of the infection, we found that the virulent clone overgrew the avirulent clone. However, host genotype had a major effect on the outcome of competition. In a relatively resistant mouse genotype (C57B1/6J), the avirulent clone was suppressed below detectable levels after 10 days, and apparently lost from the infection. By contrast, in more susceptible mice (CBA/Ca), the avirulent clone was initially suppressed, but it persisted, and during the chronic phase of infection it did better than it did in single infections. Thus, the qualitative outcome of competition depended on host genotype. We suggest that these differences may be explained by different immune responses in the two mouse strains. Host genotype and resistance could therefore play a key role in the outcome of within-host competition between parasite clones and in the evolution of parasite virulence.

TI Epidemiology of Andean cutaneous leishmaniasis: Incrimination of
   Lutzomyia ayacuchensis (Diptera : Psychodidae) as a vector of Leishmania
   in geographically isolated, upland valleys of Peru
AB The southernmost limit of the distribution of endemic Andean cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), commonly known as Uta, is localized in the western Andean valleys of Ayacucho, Peru. This area is completely isolated from other regions endemic for this disease. Identification of the insect vector for Andean CL was carried out by combining entomologic and parasitologic approaches. Two Lutzomyia species were captured: Lutzomyia ayacuchensis and Lu. noguchii. The former species was considered responsible for transmission of Leishmania because 1) there was a coincidence in space and time between the presence of this insect and the distribution of Andean CL, 2) it was shown to be highly anthropophilic, 3) Leishmania parasites of the subgenus Viannia were detected by a specific polymerase chain reaction assay, 4) promastigotes isolated from this insect were shown by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and molecular karyotyping to belong to the same deme of Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana as the one circulating in humans living in the study area, and 5) the complete cycle of L. (V.) peruviana was observed in experimental infections of Lit. ayacuchensis. Parasite and vector homogeneity found in Ayacucho contrasted with the heterogeneity reported for other areas endemic for Andean CL. The potential influence of ecologic determinants on this geographically isolated area is discussed.

TI Evidence of waterborne transmission of Blastocystis hominis
AB A cross-sectional study was performed in February 2001 to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of Blastocystis hominis infection in army personnel who resided in an army base in Chonburi, Thailand. A total of 904 army personnel were enrolled in this study. Short-term in vitro cultivation was used to detect B. hominis in stool samples. In this population, B. hominis was the parasite most frequently found, and was identified in 334 of 904 stool specimens (36.9%). A significant association between B. hominis infection and symptoms was identified that might emphasize the role of B. hominis as a human pathogen. After adjustment for potential confounders, significantly increased risk of being infection with B. hominis was associated with being a private, working in a specific unit, and consuming unboiled drinking water. Thus, waterborne transmission of B. hominis infection was indicated at this army base. However, other modes of transmission cannot be ruled out.

TI Empirical measurement of parasite transmission between groups in a
   colonial bird
AB While epidemiological models have suggested that the spread of parasites and infectious diseases often depends critically on the extent of movement by infected individuals between populations, there is little empirical information for any organism on the frequency of between-group parasite transmission or how it varies spatially. The transmission of parasites between discrete social groups or populations may also help determine a host's total parasite or pathogen exposure. We measured the introduction of parasitic bugs (Oeciacus vicarius) into colonies of Cliff Swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) by transient birds from outside each group. The transmission of bugs increased strongly as the size of a nesting colony increased. More total transients visited the larger colonies, and the direction of change in transient numbers and the numbers of bugs introduced at a site from week to week tended to vary together. Transients at large colonies were more likely to have previously or subsequently visited other large, infested colonies. The greater likelihood of parasites being introduced into larger colonies by transient birds contributes to an increase in parasite load with increased colony size in Cliff Swallows.

TI Removal of a specialization-associated symbiont does not affect aphid
   fitness
AB Symbioses are ubiquitous in nature. However, these interactions, in particular those which are facultative from the perspective of the host, are still poorly understood. One major question is whether facultative symbionts affect host fitness, and in particular whether they can benefit the host. In pea aphid, host plant specialization was found to be associated with the presence of Pea Aphid U-type Symbiont [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 270 (2003) S209]. Host and symbiont genomes are normally co-transmitted, making it difficult to determine which is responsible for causing this variation in fitness. Here antibiotic treatment is used to selectively remove the symbiont, thus partitioning symbiont and host genomes. I find that PAUS is not responsible for causing host plant specialization. Examination of aphids in which PAUS presence has been naturally manipulated also supports this conclusion. Additional work will be necessary to determine the forces maintaining this symbiont in host populations, and whether it benefits the host insect under different conditions.

TI Epidemiology of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus in the United Kingdom:
   evidence for seasonal transmission by both virulent and avirulent modes
   of infection
AB Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) has killed many millions of wild rabbits in Europe and Australia, but has had little impact in the United Kingdom, despite outbreaks having occurred since 1994. High seroprevalence detected in the absence of associated mortality had suggested the presence of an endemic non-pathogenic strain which may be 'protecting' UK populations. Following the first detailed field study of RHDV epidemiology in the United Kingdom, using mark-recapture with serum sampling, we report that RHDV caused highly prevalent persistent infection in seropositive rabbits in the absence of associated mortality. Furthermore the virus strains responsible could not be distinguished phylogenetically from known pathogenic isolates, and were clearly very different from the only previously identified non-pathogenic strain of RHDV. These findings suggest that many-perhaps most-strains of RHDV may be propagated through both 'pathogenic' and 'non-pathogenic' modes of behaviour. Transmission occurred predominantly during and just after the breeding season.

TI Genetic correlations and the coevolutionary dynamics of three-species
   systems
AB The majority of species interact with at least several others. We develop simple genetic models of coevolution between three species where interactions are mediated by quantitative traits. We assume that one of the species has two quantitative traits, each of which governs its interaction with one of the other two species. We use this model to explore how genetic correlations between the two traits in the multivariate species shape the evolutionary dynamics and outcomes of three species interactions. Our results suggest that genetic correlations are most important when at least one of the interactions is between a predator and prey or parasite and host. In these cases, genetic correlations between traits lead to a wide variety of novel coevolutionary outcomes and dynamics. In particular, genetic correlations can affect the existence and stability of coevolutionary equilibrium points, and they can lead to recurrent or permanent maladaptation. When the three species interact only as competitors or mutualists, however, genetic correlations have no effect on the outcome of coevolution. In all cases, our results reveal the surprising conclusion that both positive and negative genetic correlations between traits have qualitatively identical effects on coevolutionary dynamics.

TI Fitness of indirectly transmitted pathogens: Restraint and constraint
AB Many pathogens of medical and veterinary importance have obligatory multihost life cycles. Yet, theoretical models aiming to predict patterns of pathogen reproductive success and the limited empirical data available with which to evaluate them, focus on directly transmitted microparasites. Patterns of host exploitation and the relative fitness of individual pathogen genotypes throughout the different host stages of multihost life cycles have thus remained ignored. We examined correlated responses to artificial selection of Schistosoma mansoni lines selected for high or low infection intensity in the intermediate host. Pathogen fitness in the intermediate host was strongly inversely correlated with pathogen fitness in the definitive host. Moreover, high pathogen infection intensity was associated with decreased, rather than increased, virulence to its intermediate host. These results raise important implications regarding the impact of genetic constraints on the maintenance of genetic and phenotypic polymorphisms in natural populations, the evolution and coevolution of parasite virulence and host specialization, as well as the success of host-directed control programs.

TI Natural selection and the organ-specific differentiation of HIV-1V3
   hypervariable region
AB The existence of organ-specific HIV-1 populations within infected hosts has been studied for many years; nonetheless results reported by different authors are somewhat discrepant. To tackle this problem, we used a population genetics approach to analyze previously published data from the V3 hypervariable region of the envelope env gene. Our results are compatible with a population subdivision by organs in 95% of individuals analyzed at autopsy. In addition, populations infecting the nervous system and testicles clearly appear as differentiated subsets of the so-called macrophage-tropic variants. Liver and kidney may harbor differentiated populations as well. Although it is widely accepted that organ compartmentalization arises as a consequence of different selective pressures imposed by different organs, a definitive demonstration has not yet been provided. Our analysis of the pattern of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions provides evidence supporting this hypothesis, without discarding the role of other evolutionary processes. In contrast, positive selection does not seem to be the mechanism responsible for the evolution of patient-specific sequences.

TI Genetic diversity and disease resistance in leaf-cutting ant societies
AB Multiple mating by females (polyandry) remains hard to explain because, while it has substantial costs, clear benefits have remained elusive. The problem is acute in the social insects because polyandry is probably particularly costly for females and most material benefits of the behavior are unlikely to apply. It has been suggested that a fitness benefit may arise from the more genetically diverse worker force that a polyandrous queen will produce. One leading hypothesis is that the increased genetic diversity of workers will improve a colony's resistance to disease. We investigated this hypothesis using a polyandrous leaf-cutting ant and a virulent fungal parasite as our model system. At high doses of the parasite most patrilines within colonies were similarly susceptible, but a few showed greater resistance. At a low dose of the parasite there was more variation between patrilines in their resistance to the parasite. Such genetic variation is a key prerequisite for polyandry to result in increased disease resistance of colonies. The relatedness of two hosts did not appear to affect the transmission of the parasite between them, but this was most likely because the parasite tested was a virulent generalist that is adapted to transmit between distantly related hosts. The resistance to the parasite was compared between small groups of ants of either high or low genetic diversity. No difference was found at high doses of the parasite, but a significant improvement in resistance in high genetic diversity groups was found at a low dose of the parasite. That there is generic variation for disease resistance means that there is the potential for polyandry to produce more disease-resistant colonies. That this genetic variation can improve the resistance of groups even under the limited conditions tested suggests that polyandry may indeed produce colonies with improved resistance to disease.

TI Spatial interactions between the hemiparasitic angiosperm Rhinanthus
   minor and its host are species-specific
AB 1. Effects of organisms that obtain resources from others (e.g. herbivores) can depend on the location of resource removal with respect to their 'prey'. We investigated whether such an effect can be seen in hemiparasitic plant-host plant interactions.
   2. We conducted rhizotron studies of the interactions between Rhinanthus minor and individuals of two common host species, Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina. Parasites were grown at two distances from the host, and growth characteristics of hosts and parasites measured over time.
   3. Parasites close to their host suffered reduced survival as a result of shading. Without shading these parasites attached earlier, produced more haustoria, grew larger and had a greater fecundity than those planted further away. This effect was significant for parasites infecting the fast-growing F. rubra, but not for parasites infecting the less vigorous F. ovina. Effect of parasite position on host biomass was significant only for F. rubra, which showed a greater reduction when infected by more proximal parasites.
   4. Differences in the response of hosts to infection, and parasite growth, suggest the effect of the position of R. minor is host-species specific.

TI Prevalence of interspecific hybrids amongst asexual fungal endophytes of
   grasses
AB Epichloe endophytes are fungal symbionts of grasses that span a continuum including asexual mutualists that are vertically transmitted, obligately sexual pathogens that are horizontally transmitted, and mixed-strategy symbionts with both mutualistic and pathogenic capabilities. Here we show that processes of genome evolution differ markedly for the different symbiont types. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis was conducted of a broad taxonomic, ecological and geographical sample of sexual and asexual isolates, in which were identified and sequenced alleles of genes for beta-tubulin (tub2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), and microsatellite alleles were identified by length polymorphisms. The majority of asexual isolates had two or three alleles of most loci, but every sexual isolate had only single alleles for each locus. Phylogenetic analysis of tub2 and tef1 indicated that in all instances of multiple alleles in an isolate, the alleles were derived from different sexual species. It is concluded that, whereas horizontally transmissible species had haploid genomes and speciation occurred cladistically, most of the strictly seedborne mutualists were interspecific hybrids with heteroploid (aneuploid or polyploid) genomes. Furthermore, the phylogenetic evidence indicated that, in at least some instances, hybridization followed rather than caused evolution of the strictly seedborne habit. Therefore, the abundance of hybrid species among grass endophytes, and their prevalence in many host populations suggests a selective advantage of hybridization for the mutualistic endophytes.

   Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus
AB We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of West Nile virus (WNV) in organs and tissues of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus mosquitoes for up to 27 days following oral infection. WNV antigen was detected in paraffin-embedded mosquitoes by immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence assays were performed on dissected salivary glands and midguts and analyzed by confocal microscopy. We evaluated the route of virus dissemination following midgut escape and the relative importance of amplifying tissues in mosquito susceptibility to infection. WNV infection was persistent in all tissues analyzed including the midgut, salivary glands, nervous system, and fat body and only declined in the cytoplasm of posterior midgut epithelial cells over time. The phenomenon of cell-to-cell spread was observed in the midgut epithelium and WNV intensely infected both circular and longitudinal muscles of the same organ. It is possible that muscle tissue serves as a conduit for virus dissemination and contributes to WNV amplification, particularly late in infection. These findings provide insight into WNV infection dynamics in a highly susceptible, epidemiologically important, North American vector. Our results pave the way for future studies to analyze physical and biological barriers to WNV dissemination in less competent mosquitoes.

   Sin Nombre virus
AB The deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) is the primary rodent host of Sin Nombre virus (SNV), the principal etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United States. Many characteristics of SNV infections of deer mice are unknown. To better understand the transmission mechanisms of SNV in deer mice, we conducted mark-recapture sampling and genetic analyses to study deer mouse population density and genetic relatedness from 2001 to 2002. We genotyped each deer mouse at 10 microsatellite loci to estimate relatedness among SNV-infected and SNV-uninfected groups, demographic categories, and individuals. Estimates of average overall population densities ranged from 1.15 to 14.95 deer mice/ha. Estimates of average population densities of SNV-infected deer mice ranged from 0 to 1.55 deer mice/ha. When evaluated as groups at one of two study sites, SNV-infected deer mice were more related to one another, on average, than they were to their uninfected cohorts. Pairwise coefficients of relatedness among individuals indicated that several deer mice infected with SNV were closely related. Most infected mice were males. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that transmission of SNV often is associated with breeding activities and aggression among males during the breeding season and suggest that post-birth behavioral associations among adults and juveniles may be a factor in the transmission of SNV.

TI Bayesian analysis of experimental epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease
AB We investigate the transmission dynamics of a certain type of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus under experimental conditions. Previous analyses of experimental data from FMD outbreaks in non-homogeneously mixing populations of sheep have suggested a decline in viraemic level through serial passage of the virus, but these do not take into account possible variation in the length of the chain of viral transmission for each animal, which is implicit in the non-observed transmission process. We consider a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed non-Markovian compartmental model for partially observed epidemic processes, and we employ powerful methodology (Markov chain Monte Carlo) for statistical inference, to address epidemiological issues under a Bayesian framework that accounts for all available information and associated uncertainty in a coherent approach. The analysis allows us to investigate the posterior distribution of the hidden transmission history of the epidemic, and thus to determine the effect of the length of the infection chain on the recorded viraemic levels, based on the posterior distribution of a p-value. Parameter estimates of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease are also obtained. The results reveal a possible decline in viraemia in one of the two experimental outbreaks. Our model also suggests that individual infectivity is related to the level of viraemia.

TI Variation in phenoloxidase activity and its relation to parasite
   resistance within and between populations of Daphnia magna
AB Estimates of phenoloxidase (PO) activity have been suggested as a useful indicator of immunocompetence in arthropods, with the idea that high PO activity would indicate high immunocompetence against parasites and pathogens. Here, we test for variation in PO activity among clones of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna and its covariation with susceptibility to infections from four different microparasite species (one bacterium and three microsporidia). Strong clonal variation in PO activity was found within and among populations of D. magna, with 45.6% of the total variation being explained by the clone effect. Quantitative measures of parasite success in infection correlated negatively with PO activity when tested across four host populations. However, these correlations disappeared when the data were corrected for population effects. We conclude that PO activity is not a useful measure of resistance to parasites or of immunocompetence within populations of D. magna. We further tested whether D. magna females that are wounded to induce PO activity are more resistant to infections with the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa than non-wounded controls. We found neither a difference in susceptibility nor a difference in disease progression between the induced group and the control group. These results do not question the function of the PO system in arthropod immune response, but rather suggest that immunocompetence cannot be assessed by considering PO activity alone. Immune response is likely to be a multifactorial trait with various host and parasite characteristics playing important roles in its expression.

TI Stochastic and spatial dynamics of nematode parasites in farmed
   ruminants
AB Host-parasite systems provide powerful opportunities for the study of spatial and stochastic effects in ecology; this has been particularly so for directly transmitted microparasites. Here, we construct a fully stochastic model of the population dynamics of a macroparasite system: trichostrongylid gastrointestinal nematode parasites of farmed ruminants. The model subsumes two implicit spatial effects: the host population size (the spatial extent of the interaction between hosts) and spatial heterogeneity ('clumping') in the infection process. This enables us to investigate the roles of several different processes in generating aggregated parasite distributions. The necessity for female worms to find a mate in order to reproduce leads to an Allee effect, which interacts nonlinearly with the stochastic population dynamics and leads to the counter-intuitive result that, when rare, epidemics can be more likely and more severe in small host populations. Clumping in the infection process reduces the strength of this Allee effect, but can hamper the spread of an epidemic by making infection events too rare. Heterogeneity in the hosts' response to infection has to be included in the model to generate aggregation at the level observed empirically.

More Cx. pipiens were captured in Centers for Disease Control miniature light traps baited with CO,, quail/hamster traps, and mosquito magnet experimental (MMX) traps placed in the tree canopy than in similar traps placed near the ground. Significantly more Cx. pipiens were captured in MMX traps placed in the canopy than in the other traps tested. Ninety-two percent and 85% of the 206 and 68 WNV isolations were from Cx. pipiens in 2002 and 2003, respectively; 5% and 12% were from Cx. salinarius. Eighty-five percent and 87% of the isolates were from mosquitoes captured in the canopy in each of the two years. The significantly larger numbers of WNV isolates from Cx. pipiens captured in the canopy are attributed to the significantly larger numbers of Cx. pipiens captured in the canopy in comparison to those captured in traps near the ground.

Both the numbers and total volume of parasites per gram of host decreased allometrically with host body mass, with slopes roughly consistent with those expected from the allometric relationship between host basal metabolic rate and body mass. From an evolutionary perspective, large body size may therefore allow hosts to escape from the deleterious effects of parasitism.

TI Unhealthy landscapes: Policy recommendations on land use change and
   infectious disease emergence
AB Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections. These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges. The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation. Policy relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. The group recommended creating Centers of ExceHence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities. The centers' objectives would be 3-fold: a) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health; b) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and c) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.

TI Linkage between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences in avian malaria
   parasites: Multiple cases of cryptic speciation?
AB Analyses of mitochondrial cytochrome b diversity among avian blood parasites of the genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium suggest that there might be as many lineages of parasites as there are species of birds. This is in sharp contrast to the approximately 175 parasite species described by traditional methods based on morphology using light microscopy. Until now it has not been clear to what extent parasite mitochondrial DNA lineage diversity reflects intra- or interspecific variation. We have sequenced part of a fast-evolving nuclear gene, dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS), and demonstrate that most of the parasite mitochondrial DNA lineages are associated with unique gene copies at this locus. Although these parasite lineages sometimes coexist in the same host individual, they apparently do not recombine and could therefore be considered as functionally distinct evolutionary entities, with independent evolutionary potential. Studies examining parasite virulence and host immune systems must consider this remarkable diversity of avian malaria parasites.

TI Mycoplasma gallisepticum infection dynamics in a house finch population:
   seasonal variation in survival, encounter and transmission rate
AB 1. We considered the impact of an emerging pathogen (Mycoplasma gallisepticum Edward and Kanarek) on apparent survival, encounter and transition rates in a population of a novel host (the house finch, Carpodacus mexicanus Muller). We used a multistate analysis of mark-encounter data from individually marked birds. Individual birds were categorized to a particular disease 'state'; transition rates among states, conditional on apparent survival, were analogous to rates of new infection and recovery from infection. We hypothesized that M. gallisepticum infection would reduce the apparent survival of infected individuals, and that the magnitude of this reduction would vary as a function of the physiological condition of the host (which was characterized in our analyses by including a demographic and an environmental surrogate as covariates).
   2. We found consistent support for the hypothesis that M. gallisepticum infection resulted in lower apparent survival among infected individuals, and that recovery rates (from infected to non-infected) were greater than infection rates in this population. We also found strong evidence indicating that infected individuals were less likely to be encountered than were non-infected individuals. Although we predicted that both sex and temperature (proxies for physiological condition) would explain a significant proportion of the variation in our data, only marginal influences of both factors on apparent survival, encounter and state transition rates were detected.
   3. Our analyses identified several factors that may be important to studies of disease in the wild. First, disease state assignment may be uncertain, which can complicate parameter estimation. Secondly, encounter rate for infected individuals in our study was low relative to that for non-infected individuals, reflecting possible behavioural changes in infected individuals. Low encounter rates reduces precision of estimated parameters, especially for multistate models. Finally, our results (and mark-recapture models in general) assume independence among individual birds. However, we are aware that there is a social structuring in house finches (and in general for many bird species). Accounting for such non-independence may be especially important for situations where the state transitions are directly related to the pattern of social contact.

Evol.8 232-234; Foster et al., (2001) Ann. Zool. Fenn.38 229-238]. Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we wish to distinguish between two possible determinants of interaction behaviour between conspecifics, namely kin-directed behaviour that reflects genetic distance between individuals, or, alternatively, interactions guided by a functional distance between individuals, specifically, with respect to disease susceptibility. We find no relationship between contact rate of individuals and the genetic distance of their respective colonies. Interestingly, we do find a significant negative correlation between contact rate and the distance between the two colonies in susceptibility to a spectrum of parasite strains. This cannot be explained by either of the a priori alternatives so we propose two further testable hypotheses to explain our results.

TI The cost of immunity in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti depends
   on immune activation
AB Although host immunity offers the obvious benefit of reducing parasite infection, it is often traded-off with other fitness components. We investigated whether the cost of an immune response in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is modulated by the antigen that activates the melanization immune response. Thus, one of three different novel antigens were injected into the mosquito's thorax - either a glass bead, a negatively charged (C-25) Sephadex bead, or a neutral (G-25) Sephadex bead - and fecundity and bead melanization were observed. Glass beads are immunologically inert and were therefore used as an inoculation control. The fecundity of mosquitoes inoculated with these beads did not differ from the fecundity of mosquitoes that did not melanize negatively charged or neutral beads. The ability of A. aegypti to melanize negatively charged Sephadex beads was associated with reduced fecundity, showing a clear cost of immunity. In contrast, melanization of the neutral beads was quite strong but had no effect on fecundity. Thus, the cost of what appeared to be the same immune response - melanization of a bead - depended on the type of bead that stimulated the immune system. Such differences might help to explain variation of immune efficacy against different parasites in natural populations.

TI Relatedness affects competitive performance of a parasitic plant
   (Cuscuta europaea) in multiple infections
AB Theoretical models predict that parasite relatedness affects the outcome of competition between parasites, and the evolution of parasite virulence. We examined whether parasite relatedness affects competition between parasitic plants (Cuscuta europaea) that share common host plants (Urtica dioica). We infected hosts with two parasitic plants that were either half-siblings or nonrelated. Relative size asymmetry between the competing parasites was significantly higher in the nonrelated infections compared to infections with siblings. This higher asymmetry was caused by the fact that the performance of some parasite genotypes decreased and that of others increased when grown in multiple infections with nonrelated parasites. This result agrees with the predictions of theories on the evolution of parasite virulence: to enhance parasite transmission, selection may favour reduced competition with genetically related parasites in hosts infected by several genotypes. However, in contrast to the most common predictions, nonrelated infections were not more virulent than the sibling infections.

AB Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major public health problem because treatment is complicated, cure rates are well below those for drug-susceptible tuberculosis ( TB), and patients may remain infectious for months or years, despite receiving the best available therapy. To gain a better understanding of MDR-TB, we characterized serial isolates recovered from 13 human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with MDR-TB, by use of IS6110 restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis, spacer oligonucleotide genotyping (i.e., "spoligotyping"), and sequencing of rpoB, katG, mabA-inhA ( including promoter), pncA, embB, rpsL, rrs, and gyrA. For all 13 patients, chronic MDR-TB was caused by a single strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; 8 (62%) of the 13 strains identified as the cause of MDR-TB belonged to the W-Beijing family. The sputum-derived isolates of 4 (31%) of the 13 patients had acquired additional drug-resistance mutations during the study. In these 4 patients, heterogeneous populations of bacilli with different resistance mutations, as well as mixtures of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant genotypes, were observed. This genetic heterogeneity may require treatment targeted at both drug-resistant and drug-susceptible phenotypes.

TI Would universal antenatal screening for HIV infection be cost-effective
   in a setting of very low prevalence? Modelling the data for Australia
AB Background. The economics of universal antenatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening should be explored if mother-to-child transmission of HIV occurs, the health-service infrastructure for universal screening exists, and optimal risk-reducing treatments can be supplied.
   Methods. We evaluated a hypothetical cohort of the antenatal population of Australia during 2001-2002, to examine whether universal antenatal HIV screening is cost-effective in this setting. A quasi-societal perspective was adopted, secondary data sources were used, and sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Costs and benefits incurred in the future were discounted to their present value.
   Results. The intervention would be cost-effective if the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV in the currently unscreened Australian antenatal population was greater than or equal to0.004372%. We predict 6.95 new diagnoses of HIV, 1.73 infections avoided, and 46.97 discounted-life-years gained. Applying favorable and unfavorable values for key variables suggests that the prevalence at which the intervention would be cost-effective is 0.0016%-0.0106%.
   Conclusions. Universal antenatal HIV screening would be cost-effective at a very low prevalence and would generate net benefits under many scenarios; accurate statistics on the true prevalence of HIV in the currently unscreened antenatal population are required.

AB HIV and syphilis affect similar patient groups and coinfection is common. All patients presenting with syphilis should be offered HIV testing and all HIV-positive patients should be regularly screened for syphilis. Syphilis agent may enhance the transmission of the other, probably through increased incidence of genital ulcers. Detection and treatment of syphilis can, therefore, help to reduce HIV transmission. Syphilis may present with non-typical features in the HIV-positive patient: there is a higher rate of symptomless primary syphilis and proportionately more HIV-positive patients present with secondary disease. Secondary infection may be more aggressive and there is an increased rate of early neurological and ophthalmic involvement. Diagnosis is generally made with serology but the clinician should be aware of the potential for false-negative serology in both primary and, less commonly, in secondary syphilis. All HIV-positive patients should be treated with a penicillin-based regimen that is adequate for the treatment of neurosyphilis. Relapse of infection is more likely in the HIV-positive patient and careful follow-up is required.

TI Phylogeography of a parasitoid wasp (Diaeretiella rapae): no evidence of
   host-associated lineages
AB The exceptional diversity of insects is often attributed to the effects of specialized relationships between insects and their hosts. Parasite-host interactions are influenced by current natural selection and dispersal, in addition to historical effects that may include past selection, vicariance, and random genetic drift. Both current and historical events can lead to reduced fitness on some hosts. If trade-offs in fitness on alternate hosts are common, adaptation to one host can prevent adaptation to another, giving rise to genetic differentiation among host-associated lineages. Previous studies of Diaeretiella rapae (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae), a parasitoid of aphids, have revealed additive genetic differences in performance between populations that parasitize different aphid host species. To determine whether D. rapae populations collected from different aphid hosts have diverged into genetically independent lineages, we constructed a haplotype network based on sequence variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We used single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to examine 2041 base pairs of mtDNA and to identify nucleotide sequences of 42 unique SSCP haplotypes. We found no association between mtDNA haplotypes and host species in either the ancestral range (Europe, Mediterranean region, Middle East, Asia) or part of the introduced range (western North America). Haplotypes likely to be ancestral were geographically widespread and found on both hosts, suggesting that the ability to use both hosts evolved prior to the diversification of the mtDNA. Ongoing gene flow appears to prevent the formation of host races.

TI Use of Wolbachia to drive nuclear transgenes through insect populations
AB Wolbachia is an inherited intracellular bacterium found in many insects of medical and economic importance. The ability of many strains to spread through populations using cytoplasmic incompatibility, involving sperm modification and rescue, provides a powerful mechanism for driving beneficial transgenes through insect populations, if such transgenes could be inserted into and expressed by Wolbachia. However, manipulating Wolbachia in this way has not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate theoretically an alternative mechanism whereby nuclear rather than cytoplasmic transgenes could be driven through populations, by linkage to a nuclear gene able to rescue modified sperm. The spread of a 'nuclear rescue construct' occurs as long as the Wolbachia show imperfect maternal transmission under natural conditions and/or imperfect rescue of modified sperm. The mechanism is most efficient when the target population is already infected with Wolbachia at high frequency, whether naturally or by the sequential release of Wolbachia-infected individuals and subsequently the nuclear rescue construct. The results provide a potentially powerful addition to the few insect transgene drive mechanisms that are available.

TI Immunological investments reflect parasite abundance in island
   populations of Darwin's finches
AB The evolution of parasite resistance can be influenced by the abundance of parasites in the environment. However, it is yet unresolved whether vertebrates change their investment in immune function in response to variation in parasite abundance. Here, we compare parasite abundance in four populations of small ground finches (Geospiza fuliginosa) in the Galapagos archipelago. We predicted that populations exposed to high parasite loads should invest more in immune defence, or alternatively use a different immunological defence strategy. We found that parasite prevalence and/or infection intensity increased with island size. As predicted, birds on large islands had increased concentrations of natural antibodies and mounted a strong specific antibody response faster than birds on smaller islands. By contrast, the magnitude of cell-mediated immune responses decreased with increasing parasite pressure, i.e. on larger islands. The data support the hypothesis that investments into the immune defence are influenced by parasite-mediated selection. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that different immunological defence strategies are optimal in parasite-rich and parasite-poor environments.

TI Bacteriocins, spite and virulence
AB There has been much interest in using social evolution theory to predict the damage to a host from parasite infection, termed parasite virulence. Most of this work has focused on how high kinship between the parasites infecting a host can select for more prudent exploitation of the host, leading to a negative relationship between virulence and parasite kinship. However, it has also been shown that if parasites can cooperate to overcome the host, then high parasite kinship within hosts can select for greater cooperation and higher growth rates, hence leading to a positive relationship between virulence and parasite kinship. We examine the impact of a spiteful behaviour, chemical (bacteriocin) warfare between microbes, on the evolution of virulence, and find a new relationship: virulence is maximized when the frequency of kin among parasites' social partners is low or high, and is minimized at intermediate values. This emphasizes how biological details can fundamentally alter the qualitative nature of theoretical predictions made by models of parasite virulence.

TI Conquering the intolerable burden of malaria: What's new, what's needed:
   A summary
AB Each year, up to three million deaths due to malaria and close to five billion episodes of clinical illness possibly meriting antimalarial therapy occur throughout the world, with Africa having more than 90% of this burden. Almost 3% of disability adjusted life years are due to malaria mortality globally, 10% in Africa. New information is presented in this supplement on malaria-related perinatal mortality, occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy, undernutrition, and neurologic, cognitive, and developmental sequelae. The entomologic determinants of transmission and uses of modeling for program planning and disease prediction and prevention are discussed. New data are presented from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe on the increasing urban malaria problem and on epidemic malaria. Between 6% and 28% of the malaria burden may occur in cities, which comprise less than 2% of the African surface. Macroeconomic projections show that the costs are far greater than the costs of individual cases, with a substantial deleterious impact of malaria on schooling of patients, external investments into endemic countries, and tourism. Poor populations are at greatest risk; 58% of the cases occur in the poorest 20% of the world's population and these patients receive the worst care and have catastrophic economic consequences from their illness. This social vulnerability requires better understanding for improving deployment, access, quality, and use of effective interventions. Studies from Ghana and elsewhere indicate that for every patient with febrile illness assumed to be malaria seen in health facilities, 4-5 episodes occur in the community. Effective actions for malaria control mandate rational public policies; market forces, which often drive sales and use of drugs and other interventions, are unlikely to guarantee their use. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria is rapidly gaining acceptance as an effective approach for countering the spread and intensity of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and other antimalarial drugs. Although costly, ACT ($1.20-2.50 per adult treatment) becomes more cost-effective as resistance to alternative drugs increases; early use of ACT may delay development of resistance to these drugs and prevent the medical toll associated with use of ineffective drugs.
   The burden of malaria in one district in Tanzania has not decreased since the primary health care approach replaced the vertical malaria control efforts of the 1960s. Despite decentralization, this situation resulted, in part, from weak district management capacity, poor coordination, inadequate monitoring, and lack of training of key staff. Experience in the Solomon Islands showed that spraying with DDT, use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and health education were all associated with disease reduction. The use of nets permitted a reduction in DDT spraying, but could not replace it without an increased malaria incidence. Baseline data and reliable monitoring of key outcome indicators are needed to measure whether the ambitious goals for the control of malaria and other diseases has occurred. Such systems are being used for evidence-based decision making in Tanzania and several other countries. Baseline cluster sampling surveys in several countries across Africa indicate that only 53% of the children with febrile illness in malarious areas are being treated; chloroquine (CQ) is used 84% of the time, even where the drug may be ineffective. Insecticide-treated bed nets were used only 2% of the time by children less than five years of age. Progress in malaria vaccine research has been substantial over the past five years; 35 candidate malaria vaccines are in development, many of which are in clinical trials. Development of new vaccines and drugs has been the result of increased investments and formation of public-private partnerships. Before malaria vaccine becomes deployed, consideration must be given to disease burden, cost-effectiveness, financing, delivery systems, and approval by regulatory agencies. Key to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness will be collection and prompt analysis of epidemiologic information. Training of persons in every aspect of malaria research and control is essential for programs to succeed. The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is actively promoting research capacity strengthening and has established networks of institutions and scientists throughout the African continent, most of whom are now linked by modern information-sharing networks. Evidence over the past century is that successful control malaria programs have been linked to strong research activities. To ensure effective coordination and cooperation between the growing number of research and control coalitions forming in support of, malaria activities, an umbrella group is needed. With continued support for scientists and control workers globally, particularly in low-income malarious countries, the long-deferred dream of malaria elimination can become a reality.

TI The burden of co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and
   malaria in pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa
AB In sub-Saharan Africa, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria are among the leading causes of morbidity during pregnancy. We reviewed available information collected since the first report 15 years ago that HIV impaired the ability of pregnant women to control malaria parasitemia. Results from 11 studies showed that HIV-infected women experienced consistently more peripheral and placental malaria (summary relative risk = 1.58 and 1.66, respectively), higher parasite densities, and more febrile illnesses, severe anemia, and adverse birth outcomes than HIV-uninfected women, particularly in multigravidae. Thus, HIV alters the typical gravidity-specific pattern of malaria risk by shifting the burden from primarily primigravidae and secundigravidae to all pregnant women. The proportional increase of malaria during pregnancy attributable to HIV was estimated to be 5.5% and 18.8% for populations with HIV prevalences of 10% and 40%, respectively. Maternal malaria was associated with a two-fold higher HIV-1 viral concentrations. Three studies investigating whether placental malaria increased mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission showed conflicting results, possibly reflecting a complex balance between placental malarial immune responses and stimulation of HIV-1 viral replication. Further investigations of interactions between antiretroviral drugs, prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole, and antimalarial drugs in pregnant women are urgently needed. Although much has been learned in the past 15 years about the interaction between malaria and HIV-1 during pregnancy, many issues still require further information to improve our understanding. There is a clear need to strengthen the deployment of existing malaria and HIV prevention and intervention measures for pregnant women.

TI Rationalizing historical successes of malaria control in Africa in terms
   of mosquito resource availabilty management
AB Environmental management of mosquito resources is a promising approach with which to control malaria, but it has seen little application in Africa for more than half a century. Here we present a kinetic model of mosquito foraging for aquatic habitats and vertebrate hosts that allows estimation of malaria transmission intensity by defining the availability of these resources as the rate at which individual mosquitoes encounter and use them. The model captures historically observed responses of malaria transmission to environmental change, highlights important gaps in current understanding of vector ecology, and suggests convenient solutions. Resource availability is an intuitive concept that provides an adaptable framework for models of mosquito population dynamics, gene flow, and pathogen transmission that can be conveniently parameterized with direct field measurements. Furthermore, the model presented predicts that drastic reductions of malaria transmission are possible with environmental management and elucidates an ecologic basis for previous successes of integrated malaria control in Africa before the advent of DDT or chloroquine. Environmental management for malaria control requires specialist skills that are currently lacking in sub-Saharan Africa where they are needed most. Infrastructure and human capacity building in clinical, public health, and environmental disciplines should therefore be prioritized so that growing financial support for tackling malaria can be translated into truly integrated control programs.

TI Development of a predictive model for Ross River virus disease in
   Brisbane, Australia
AB This paper describes the development of an empirical model to forecast epidemics of Ross River virus (RRV) disease using the multivariate seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) technique in Brisbane, Australia. We obtained computerized data on notified RRV disease cases, climate, high tide, and population sizes in Brisbane for the period 1985-2001 from the Queensland Department of Health, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Queensland Department of Transport, and Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. The SARIMA model was developed and validated by dividing the data file into two data sets: the data between January 1985 and December 2000 were used to construct a model, and those between January and December 2001 to validate it. The SARIMA models show that monthly precipitation (beta = 0.004, P = 0.031) was significantly associated with RRV transmission. However, there was no significant association between other climate variables (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, and high tides) and RRV transmission. The predictive values in the model were generally consistent with actual values (root mean square percentage error = 0.94%). Therefore, this model may have applications as a decision supportive tool in disease control and risk-management planning programs.

TI Adaptation in an insect host-plant pathogen interaction
AB Selection on parasites to adapt to local host populations may be direct or through other components of the system such as vectors or the food plant on which the parasite is ingested. To test for local adaptation of nucleopolyhedrovirus among island populations of western tent caterpillars, Malacosoma californicum pluviale, we compared virus isolates from three geographically distinct sites with different dominant host plants. Pathogenicity, speed of kill and virus production of each isolate were examined on the three food plants. Virus isolates from the two permanent host populations had the fastest speed of kill on the host plant from which they were isolated. This was not the case for a caterpillar population that goes extinct when populations are regionally low. Virus isolates on some plant species combined rapid speed of kill with high virus yield. Infection of hosts by mixed microparasite populations could facilitate local adaptation in response to differing food plant chemistry.

TI Using the angle frequency method to detect signals of competition and
   predation in experimental time series
AB Identifying interactions among organisms is central to the study of ecology. The Angle Frequency Method (AFM) allows the detection of interactions in time series data. The AFM takes pairwise data plotted in phase diagrams and identifies signals (vector directions in phase diagrams) associated with particular interactions. Using microbial experimental systems consisting of predators (bacteriophage T4) and prey/competitors (strains of Escherichia coli), we demonstrate that the AFM can identify predator-prey and competitive interactions. The level of control afforded by such microbial experimental systems allows direct tests of the utility and robustness of the AFM. Signals of predation were distinct from signals of competition, with the strongest signal of predation corresponding to the collapse of the predator population at low prey densities. Signals of competition reflected the difference in competitive strength between the superior and the inferior competitors. In addition, the effects of invasion and resource enrichment on interactions in the laboratory communities were detectable using the AFM. Our analyses support results from model simulations and analyses of lake time series by identifying similar sets of signals characteristic of predation and competition, and demonstrate that the AFM is an effective tool in rigorous studies of time series.

TI West Nile virus: pending crisis for greater sage-grouse
AB Scientists have feared that emerging infectious diseases could complicate efforts to conserve rare and endangered species, but quantifying impacts has proven difficult until now. We report unexpected impacts of West Nile virus (WNv) on radio-marked greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species that has declined 45-80% and is endangered in Canada and under current consideration for federal listing in the US. We show that WNv reduced late-summer survival an average of 25% in four radio-marked populations in the western US and Canada. Serum from 112 sage-grouse collected after the outbreak show that none had antibodies, suggesting that they lack resistance. The spread of WNv represents a significant new stressor on sage-grouse and probably other at-risk species. While managing habitat might lessen its impact on sage-grouse populations, WNv has left wildlife and public health officials scrambling to address surface water and vector control issues in western North America.

TI Is invasion success explained by the enemy release hypothesis?
AB A recent trend in invasion ecology relates the success of non-indigenous species (NIS) to reduced control by enemies such as pathogens, parasites and predators (i.e. the enemy release hypothesis, ERH). Despite the demonstrated importance of enemies to host population dynamics, studies of the ERH are split - biogeographical analyses primarily show a reduction in the diversity of enemies in the introduced range compared with the native range, while community studies imply that NIS are no less affected by enemies than native species in the invaded community. A broad review of the invasion literature implies at least eight non-exclusive explanations for this enigma. In addition, we argue that the ERH has often been accepted uncritically wherever (i) NIS often appear larger, more fecund, or somehow 'better' than either congeners in the introduced region, or conspecifics in the native range; and (ii) known enemies are conspicuously absent from the introduced range. However, all NIS, regardless of their abundance or impact, will lose natural enemies at a biogeographical scale. Given the complexity of processes that underlie biological invasions, we argue against a simple relationship between enemy 'release' and the vigour, abundance or impact of NIS.

   host
AB The developing complementary technologies of DNA microarrays and proteomics are allowing the response of bacterial pathogens to different environments to be probed at the whole genome level. Although using these technologies to analyze pathogens within a host is still in its infancy, initial studies indicate that these technologies will be valuable tools for understanding how the pathogen reacts to the in vivo microenvironment. Some bacterial pathogens have been shown to substantially modify their surface components in response to the host immune system and modify their energy metabolism and transport pathways to allow efficient growth within the host. Further detailed analyses of these responses will increase understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, identify new bacterial virulence factors, and aid in the design of new vaccines.

TI Using human disease outbreaks as a guide to multilevel ecosystem
   interventions
AB Human health often depends on environmental variables and is generally subject to widespread and comprehensive surveillance. Compared with other available measures of ecosystem health, human disease incidence may be one of the most useful and practical bioindicators for the often elusive gauge of ecologic well-being. We argue that many subtle ecosystem disruptions are often identified only as a result of detailed epidemiologic investigations after an anomalous increase in human disease incidence detected by routine surveillance mechanisms. Incidence rates for vector-mediated diseases (e.g., arboviral illnesses) and direct zoonoses (e.g., hantaviruses) are particularly appropriate as bioindicators to identify underlying ecosystem disturbances. Outbreak data not only have the potential to act as a pivotal warning system for ecosystem disruption, but may also be used to identify interventions for the preservation of ecologic health. With this approach, appropriate ecologically based strategies for remediation can be introduced at an earlier stage than would be possible based solely on environmental monitoring, thereby reducing the level of "ecosystem distress" as well as resultant disease burden in humans. This concept is discussed using local, regional, and global examples, thereby introducing the concept of multilevel ecosystem interventions.

TI Pesticide spraying for West Nile virus control and emergency department
   asthma visits in New York City, 2000
AB Pyrethroid pesticides were applied via ground spraying to residential neighborhoods in New York City during July-September 2000 to control mosquito vectors of West Nile virus (WNV). Case reports link pyrethroid exposure to asthma exacerbations, but population-level effects on asthma from large-scale mosquito control programs have not been assessed. We conducted this analysis to determine whether widespread urban pyrethroid pesticide use was associated with increased rates of emergency department (ED) visits for asthma. We recorded the dates and locations of pyrethroid spraying during the 2000 WNV season in New York City and tabulated all ED visits for asthma to public hospitals from October 1999 through November 2000 by date and ZIP code of patients' residences. The association between pesticide application and asthma-related emergency visits was evaluated across date and ZIP code, adjusting for season, day of week, and daily temperature, precipitation, particulate, and ozone levels. There were 62,827 ED visits for asthma during the 14-month study period, across 162 ZIP codes. The number of asthma visits was similar in the 3-day periods before and after spraying (510 vs. 501, p = 0.78). In multivariate analyses, daily rates of asthma visits were not associated with pesticide spraying (rate ratio = 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1-07). Secondary analyses among children and for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease yielded similar null results. This analysis shows that spraying pyrethroids for WNV control in New York City was not followed by population-level increases in public hospital ED visit rates for asthma.

TI HIV-1 subtype in Scotland: the establishment of a national surveillance
   system
AB Historically, subtype B viruses in men who have sex with men (MSM) and injecting drug users (IDU) dominated the HIV epidemic in the United Kingdom, whereas non-B heterosexual infections dominate globally. Heterosexual contact is now the most common route of transmission in the United Kingdom. Here we monitor HIV subtype in Scotland, and link it to origin of infection. HIV-1 sequence was generated from new diagnoses and the subtype thus obtained linked with demographic data. Virus was subtyped from 80% (137/171) of all new diagnoses in Scotland. Of 58 individuals infected by heterosexual contact, 74% (43) harboured non-B viruses, contrasting with 7% (5/68) of those infected by IDU or MSM. Eighty-four per cent of non-Bs (46/55) were probably acquired outside the United Kingdom, but nine individuals probably acquired their non-B infection in the United Kingdom. Non-B subtypes of HIV-1 predominate in recently diagnosed, heterosexually acquired infections in Scotland and are present in all risk groups, even those with no exposure outside the United Kingdom.

TI Evolution of mixed strategies of plant defense allocation against
   natural enemies
AB In this study we present a simple optimization model for the evolution of defensive strategies (tolerance and resistance) of plants against their natural enemies. The model specifically evaluates the consequences of introducing variable costs and benefits of tolerance and resistance and nonlinear cost-and-benefit functions for tolerance and resistance. Incorporating these assumptions, the present model of plant defense predicts different evolutionary scenarios, not expected by previous work. Basically, the presence of an adaptive peak corresponding to intermediate levels of allocation to tolerance and resistance can arise when the shape parameter of the cost function is higher than the corresponding of the benefit function. The presence of two alternatives peaks of maximum tolerance and maximum resistance occurs only when benefits of tolerance and resistance interact less than additive. Finally, the presence of one peak of maximum resistance or maximum tolerance depends on the relative values of the magnitude of costs for tolerance and resistance. An important outcome of our model is that under a plausible set of conditions, variable costs of tolerance and resistance can represent an important aspect involved in the maintenance of intermediate levels of tolerance and resistance, and in favoring adaptive divergence in plant defensive strategies among populations. The model offers a framework for future theoretical and empirical work toward understanding spatial variation in levels of allocation to different defensive strategies.

TI Microbial genotype and insect fitness in an aphid-bacterial symbiosis
AB 1. The impact of the genotype of symbiotic micro-organisms on ecologically important traits of their animal hosts was explored using the symbiosis between aphids and the bacterium Buchnera. This symbiosis has a nutritional basis, with aphids dependent on Buchnera-derived essential amino acids. The genetic variation studied was copy number of the Buchnera genes trpEG, coding for anthranilate synthase in the biosynthetic pathway of the essential amino acid tryptophan. TrpEG amplification has been predicted to enhance tryptophan biosynthesis rates by Buchnera.
   2. TrpEG amplification of Buchnera varied from 2 to 16-fold relative to other trp genes among aphids from natural populations of the Pea Aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris).
   3. The fitness of aphids on Vicia faba plants of low phloem tryptophan content under field conditions and on tryptophan-free chemically defined diets under laboratory conditions did not vary significantly with trpEG copy number of Buchnera. It is concluded that naturally occurring variation in trpEG copy number does not have large and readily detectable effects on aphid fitness.
   4. This first study on the impact of genetic diversity of Buchnera on ecologically important traits of the insect host illustrates the importance of empirical checks on the validity of plausible inferences made from genomic or other molecular data.

TI Requirement of interleukin-17A for systemic anti-Candida albicans host
   defense in mice
AB T cells are required for normal host defense against fungal infection, and individuals with T cell - deficiency syndromes are highly susceptible to fungal pathogens. Interleukin (IL)-17A is a proinflammatory cytokine that interconnects myeloid and lymphoid host defense. The role of murine ( m) IL-17A/mIL-17A receptor ( R) interactions was evaluated in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. In response to systemic challenge with Candida albicans, expression of mIL-17A was induced, and IL-17AR knockout ( IL-17AR(-/-)) mice had dose-dependent, substantially reduced survival. Fungal burden in the kidneys of IL-17AR(-/-) mice was dramatically increased (25-fold at 96 h). In IL-17AR(-/-) mice, both mobilization of peripheral neutrophils and their influx to infected organs were significantly impaired and delayed. In vivo expression of mIL-17A protected normal mice from a lethal dose of C. albicans (100% at day 7 and 65% at day 42). The data suggest that the mIL-17A/mIL-17AR system is required for normal fungal host defense in vivo. IL-17A could have potential as a therapeutic cytokine for systemic C. albicans infections in immunocompromised patients with cancer or advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI Role of mannose-binding lectin in the innate defense against Candida
   albicans: Enhancement of complement activation, but lack of opsonic
   function, in phagocytosis by human dendritic cells
AB Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum collectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. We have investigated the role of MBL in the first-line defense against Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen. MBL bound C. albicans via its lectin domain, resulting in agglutination of the organisms upon their outgrowth of hyphae. In a human in vitro MBL system, deposition of C4 fragments on C. albicans was increased when exogenous MBL was added to serum samples from MBL-deficient individuals. Similar enhancement of deposition of iC3b also was observed. MBL and enhanced opsonic C3 fragments mediated by MBL did not facilitate opsonophagocytosis of the organisms by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). However, MBL was found to inhibit the growth of C. albicans independently of complement activation, although, with complement activation, further inhibition was observed. We concluded that MBL plays an important role in the first-line defense against C. albicans without the need for opsonophagocytosis by DCs, in which a direct interaction of MBL with C. albicans results in agglutination and accelerated complement activation via the lectin pathway, leading to inhibition of growth.

TI Confronting the avian influenza threat: vaccine development for a
   potential pandemic
AB Sporadic human infection with avian influenza viruses has raised concern that reassortment between human and avian subtypes could generate viruses of pandemic potential. Vaccination is the principal means to combat the impact of influenza. During an influenza pandemic the immune status of the population would differ from that which exists during interpandemic periods. An emerging pandemic virus will create a surge in worldwide vaccine demand and new approaches in immunisation strategies may be needed to ensure optimum protection of unprimed individuals when vaccine antigen may be limited. The manufacture of vaccines from pathogenic avian influenza viruses by traditional methods is not feasible for safety reasons as well as technical issues. Strategies adopted to overcome these issues include the use of reverse genetic systems to generate reassortant strains, the use of baculovirus-expressed haemagglutinin or related non-pathogenic avian influenza strains, and the use of adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity. In clinical trials, conventional surface-antigen influenza virus vaccines produced from avian viruses have proved poorly immunogenic in immunologically naive populations. Adjuvanted or whole-virus preparations may improve immunogenicity and allow sparing of antigen.

   strains infecting the Neotropical beetle, Chelymorpha alternans Boh.
   (Chrysomelidae, Cassidinae)
AB Wolbachia are maternally inherited endocellular bacteria known to alter insect host reproduction to facilitate their own transmission. Multiple Wolbachia infections are more common in tropical than temperate insects but few studies have investigated their dynamics in field populations. The beetle, Chelymorpha alternans, found throughout the Isthmus of Panama, is infected with two strains of Wolbachia, wCalt1 (99.2% of beetles) and wCalt2 (53%). Populations infected solely by the wCalt1 strain were limited to western Pacific Panama, whereas populations outside this region were either polymorphic for single (wCalt1) and double infections (wCalt1 +wCalt2) or consisted entirely of double infections. The wCalt2 strain was not found as a single infection in the wild. Both strains caused cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). The wCalt1 strain caused weak CI (similar to20%) and the double infection induced moderate CI (similar to70-90%) in crosses with uninfected beetles. The wCalt1 strain rescued about 75% of eggs fertilized by sperm from wCalt2 males. Based on the relationships of beetle mtDNA and infection status, maternal transmission, and repeated population sampling we determined that the double infection invaded C. alternans populations about 100 000 years ago and that the wCalt2 strain appears to be declining in some populations, possibly due to environmental factors. This may be the first study to demonstrate an association between widespread strain loss and environmental factors in the field.

TI Diversity and specificity of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae on
   wild and cultivated legumes
AB The symbiotic partnerships between legumes and their root-nodule bacteria (rhizobia) vary widely in their degree of specificity, but the underlying reasons are not understood. To assess the potential for host-range evolution, we have investigated microheterogeneity among the shared symbionts of a group of related legume species. Host specificity and genetic diversity were characterized for a soil population of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae (Rlv) sampled using six wild Vicia and Lathyrus species and the crop plants pea (Pisum sativum) and broad bean (Vicia faba). Genetic variation among 625 isolates was assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of loci on the chromosome (ribosomal gene spacer) and symbiosis plasmid (nodD region). Broad bean strongly favoured a particular symbiotic genotype that formed a distinct phylogenetic subgroup of Rlv nodulation genotypes but was associated with a range of chromosomal backgrounds. Host range tests of 80 isolates demonstrated that only 34% of isolates were able to nodulate V. faba. By contrast, 89% were able to nodulate all the local wild hosts tested, so high genetic diversity of the rhizobial population cannot be ascribed directly to the diversity of host species at the site. Overall the picture is of a population of symbionts that is diversified by plasmid transfer and shared fairly indiscriminately by local wild legume hosts. The crop species are less promiscuous in their interaction with symbionts than the wild legumes.

   and plasma levels of HIV RNA in perinatally infected pediatric
   populations
AB Background. CD8 cell responses to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been correlated with virus control in adults, and this study outcome has been controversial. Attempts to establish the same correlation in small numbers of children have also been made, with similar controversy resulting.
   Methods. A total of 110 perinatally infected children were studied. Nine of the children (mean age, 1.9 years vs. 11.8 years for the remaining 101 children) received treatment with anti-retrovirals within the first 3 months of life. CD4 cell and HIV RNA levels were measured. Production of interferon-gamma after exposure to recombinant vaccinia vectors was measured by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay.
   Results. Responses to Pol and Gag antigens exceeded those to Nef and Env antigens, with responses significantly approximated by a quadratic function for which peak responses occurred at plasma HIV RNA levels of 10(3)-10(4) HIV RNA copies/mL. Children who are treated early in life with highly active antiretroviral therapy have fewer total responses of ELISPOT-forming cells to HIV antigens than do children who are treated later in life.

TI Transmission of Yersinia pestis from an infectious biofilm in the flea
   vector
AB Transmission of plague by fleas depends on infection of the proventricular valve in the insect's foregut by a dense aggregate of Yersinia pestis. Proventricular infection requires the Y. pestis hemin storage (hms) genes; here, we show that the hms genes are also required to produce an extracellular matrix and a biofilm in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that a transmissible infection in the flea depends on the development of a biofilm on the hydrophobic, acellular surface of spines that line the interior of the proventriculus. The development of biofilm and proventricular infection did not depend on the 3 Y. pestis quorum-sensing systems. The extracellular matrix enveloping the Y. pestis biofilm in the flea appeared to incorporate components from the flea's blood meal, and bacteria released from the biofilm were more resistant to human polymorphonuclear leukocytes than were in vitro-grown Y. pestis. Enabling arthropod-borne transmission represents a novel function of a bacterial biofilm.

TI The spatial-temporal distribution of drought, wetting, and human cases
   of St. Louis encephalitis in southcentral Florida
AB Using a dynamic hydrology model, we simulated land surface wetness conditions at 42 sites in 28 counties in southcentral Florida from 1990 to 1998 and compared these simulations with the incidence of human cases of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) within these counties. Within counties, drought four months prior and wetting one-half month prior were significantly associated with human cases of SLE. Simulated land surface wetness conditions resolved transmission loci in both space and time, and May drought was significantly associated with the subsequent occurrence of human SLE cases. These findings are consistent with previous results associating simulated land surface wetness conditions with the transmission of SLE virus as measured in sentinel chickens, and support our working hypothesis that springtime drought facilitates SLE virus amplification in mosquito and wild bird populations.

   an eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus focus in central Alabama
AB Uranotaenia sapphirina, Culex erraticus, and Cx. peccator were collected in an enzootic eastern equine encephalomyclitis (EEE) virus focus in central Alabama (Tuskegee National Forest) from 2001 to 2003 and analyzed for virus as well as host selection. EEE virus was detected in each species every year except 2003, when pools of Cx. peccator were negative. Most (97%) of the 130 Cx. peccator blood meals identified were from ectothermic hosts; 3% were from birds. Among blood meals from reptiles (approximately 75 % of the total), 81 % were from Agkistrodon piscivortis (cottonmouth); all amphibian blood meals (approximately 25%) were from Rana spp. with > 50% taken from the bullfrog R. catesbeiana. Host identifications were made from 131 of 197 Cx. erraticus, but only 3 (2%) were derived from ectothermic species. Identification of Ur. sapphirina blood meals proved difficult and only 2 of 35 hosts were determined. Both were from R. catesbeiana. Ectothermic species are possible FEE virus reservoirs in the southeastern United States where species such as Cx. peccator and Ur. sapphirina occur with large, diverse reptilian, amphibian, and avian populations such as those at the Tuskegee site.

The majority (71%) of the patients were female. Clinical manifestations included fever (100%), headache (71%), myalgia (71%), arthralgia (43%), pulmonary involvement (29%), and diffuse rash (1.4%). Moreover, R. afficae was detected by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the gltA and ompA genes in 62 (75%) of 83 adult Amblyomma variegatum ticks collected from cattle in the same region. These results confirm the presence of a previously unrecognized infectious disease in the indigenous Cameroonian population, as well as extend the established range of R. africae.

TI The effect of a pathogen epidemic on the genetic structure and
   reproductive strategy of the crustacean Daphnia magna
AB Host-parasite coevolution is potentially of great importance in producing and maintaining biological diversity. However, there is a lack of evidence for parasites directly driving genetic change. We examined the impact of an epidemic of the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa on a natural population of the crustacean Daphnia magna through the use of molecular markers (allozymes) and laboratory experiments to determine the susceptibility of hosts collected during and after the epidemic. Some allozyme genotypes were more heavily infected than others in field samples, and the population genetic structure differed during and after the epidemic, consistent with a response to parasite-mediated selection. Laboratory studies showed no evidence for the evolution of higher resistance, but did reveal an intriguing life-history pattern: host genotypes that were more susceptible also showed a greater tendency to engage in sex. In light of this, we suggest a model of host-parasite dynamics that incorporates the cycles of sex and parthenogenesis that Daphnia undergo in the field.

TI Incipient evolution of Wolbachia compatibility types
AB Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is induced in arthropods by the maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia. When infected males mate with uninfected females or with females bearing a different Wolbachia variant, paternal chromosomes behave abnormally and embryos die. This pattern can be interpreted as resulting from two bacterial effects: One (usually termed mod, for modification) would affect sperm and induce embryo death, unless Wolbachia is also present in the egg, which implies the existence of a second effect, usually termed resc, for rescue. The fact that Cl can occur in crosses between males and females infected by different Wolbachia shows that mod and resc interact in a specific manner. In other words, different compatibility types, or mod/resc pairs seem to have diverged from one (or a few) common ancestor(s). We are interested in the process allowing the evolution of mod/resc pairs. Here this question is addressed experimentally after cytoplasmic injection into a single host species (Drosophila simulans) by investigating compatibility relationships between closely related Wolbachia variants naturally evolving in different dipteran hosts: D. simulans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Rhagoletis cerasi. Our results suggest that closely related bacteria can be totally or partially incompatible. The compatibility relationships observed can be explained using a formal description of the mod and resc functions, implying both qualitative and quantitative variations.

TI Experimental evidence for costs of parasitism for a threatened species,
   White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa)
AB 1. We used field and experimental data to test if white grub parasites (Diplostomatidae) are costly to White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa), a threatened species restricted to four sites in the Chihuahuan desert, New Mexico.
   2. Of the four populations of C. tularosa, two are native and two are introduced. The two native populations (Malpais Spring and Salt Creek) are genetically distinct and have been isolated historically in dissimilar aquatic habitats (brackish spring and saline river, respectively). Two populations were established c. 1970 from translocation of Salt Creek fish to another saline river (Lost River) and another brackish spring (Mound Spring).
   3. Physid snails (Physidae) occur in the two brackish spring habitats but not the saline river habitats. These snails are first intermediate hosts for white grubs (Diplostomatidae). Therefore, the two freshwater populations are infected by diplostomatids. For the Mound Spring population, the ecological relationship of C. tularosa and diplostomatids has only recently occurred.
   4. In 1995, a population crash occurred for C. tularosa at Mound Spring, associated with a parasite outbreak. Diplostomatids were the presumptive cause of this crash, but this was inferred from observation of infection in collected fish.
   5. Two years of seasonal sampling of the two populations revealed that all collected fish were infected. Parasite intensities were significantly lower in winter compared to summer, suggesting that heavily infected fish were lost from the population on a seasonal basis.
   6. We conducted an artificial infection experiment to assess the costs of parasitism for previously uninfected C. tularosa females for various life-history traits. Under experimental conditions, diplostomatid infection caused increases in C. tularosa mortality and decreases in growth and fat storage. Individual-level costs of parasitism may translate to population-level patterns of parasitism for C. tularosa populations. Results from this study suggest that parasites may impact host overwinter survival, which is consistent with lower parasite intensities found during winters in wild populations.

TI Host ecology determines the relative fitness of virus genotypes in
   mixed-genotype nucleopolyhedrovirus infections
AB Mixed-genotype infections are common in many natural host-parasite interactions. Classical kin-selection models predict that single-genotype infections can exploit host resources prudently to maximize fitness, but that selection favours rapid exploitation when co-infecting genotypes share limited host resources. However, theory has outpaced evidence: we require empirical studies of pathogen genotypes that naturally co-infect hosts. Do genotypes actually compete within hosts? Can host ecology affect the outcome of co-infection? We posed both questions by comparing traits of infections in which two baculovirus genotypes were fed to hosts alongside inocula of the same or a different genotype. The host, Panolis flammea, is a herbivore of Pinus sylvestris and Pi. contorta. The pathogen, PfNPV (a nucleopolyhedrovirus), occurs naturally as mixtures of genotypes that differ, when isolated, in pathogenicity, speed of kill and yield. Single-genotype infection traits failed to predict the 'winning' genotypes in co-infections. Co-infections infected and caused lethal disease in more hosts, and produced high yields, relative to single-genotype infections. The need to share with nonkin did not cause fitness costs to either genotype. In fact, in hosts feeding on Pi. sylvestris, one genotype gained increased yields in mixed-genotype infections. These results are discussed in relation to theory surrounding adaptive responses to competition with nonkin for limited resources.

TI Decreased HIV transmission after a policy of providing free access to
   highly active antiretroviral therapy in Taiwan
AB Background. Taiwan established a nationwide surveillance system for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in 1989 and adopted a policy to provide all HIV-infected citizens with free access to highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART) beginning in April 1997. This provided an opportunity to determine the effect of the widespread use of HAART on the evolution of the HIV epidemic.
   Methods. We analyzed national HIV surveillance data. The HIV transmission rate was estimated by use of an exponential model of HIV epidemic evolution, with statistical projection over the interval between infection and detection to fit the surveillance data.
   Results. By the end of 2002, the cumulative number of HIV-infected citizens in Taiwan had reached 4390 (0.019% of the total population). After free access to HAART was established, the estimated HIV transmission rate decreased by 53% (0.391 vs. 0.184 new cases/prevalent case-year [95% confidence interval, 31%-65%]). There was no statistically significant change in the incidence of syphilis, in the general population or among HIV-positive patients, during the same period.
   Conclusion. Providing free HAART to all HIV-infected citizens was associated with a 53% decrease in the HIV transmission rate and contributed to the control of the HIV epidemic in Taiwan.

TI West Nile virus infection rates in pooled and individual mosquito
   samples
AB The detection of West Nile virus (WNV) in mosquitoes by real-time RT-PCR provides valuable information on the epidemiology of the virus and identifies mosquito species that are potential vectors. Testing sets of pooled mosquitoes of the same species is logistically the easiest and most cost-effective approach for WNV testing; however, little information is available on how the results of small pooled sets relate to those of testing individual mosquitoes. During the 2002 outbreak, we compared pooled and individual samples of two mosquito species (Culex pipiens and Culex restuans) collected from three Health Unit regions in Ontario, Canada. Significantly more Cx. restuans were infected with WNV compared to Cx. pipiens. We show that with pool sizes of five individuals both MIR (minimum infection rates) and MLE (maximum likelihood estimation) values were acceptable in estimating infection rates.

TI Widespread vertical transmission and associated host sex-ratio
   distortion within the eukaryotic phylum Microspora
AB Vertical transmission (VT) and associated manipulation of host reproduction are widely reported among prokaryotic endosymbionts. Here, we present evidence for widespread use of VT and associated sex-ratio distortion in a eukaryotic phylum. The Microspora are an unusual and diverse group of eukaryotic parasites that infect all animal phyla. Following our initial description of a microsporidian that feminizes its crustacean host, we survey the diversity and distribution of VT within the Microspora. We find that vertically transmitted microsporidia are ubiquitous in the amphipod hosts sampled and that they are also diverse, with 11 species of microsporidia detected within 16 host species. We found that infections were more common in females than males, suggesting that host sex-ratio distortion occurs in five out of eight parasite species tested. Phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrates that VT occurs in all major lineages of the phylum Microspora and that sex-ratio distorters are found on multiple branches of the phylogenetic tree. We propose that VT is either an ancestral trait or evolves with peculiar frequency in this phylum. If the association observed here between VT and host sex-ratio distortion holds true across other host taxa, these eukaryotic parasites may join the bacterial endosymbionts in their importance as sex-ratio distorters.

TI Evolutionary stability of mutualism: interspecific population regulation
   as an evolutionarily stable strategy
AB Interspecific mutualisms are often vulnerable to instability because low benefit: cost ratios can rapidly lead to extinction or to the conversion of mutualism to parasite-host or predator-prey interactions. We hypothesize that the evolutionary stability of mutualism can depend on how benefits and costs to one mutualist vary with the population density of its partner, and that stability can be maintained if a mutualist can influence demographic rates and regulate the population density of its partner. We test this hypothesis in a model of mutualism with key features of senita cactus (Pachycereus schottii) - senita moth (Upiga virescens) interactions, in which benefits of pollination and costs of larval seed consumption to plant fitness depend on pollinator density. We show that plants can maximize their fitness by allocating resources to the production of excess flowers at the expense of fruit. Fruit abortion resulting from excess flower production reduces pre-adult survival of the pollinating seed-consumer, and maintains its density beneath a threshold that would destabilize the mutualism. Such a strategy of excess flower production and fruit abortion is convergent and evolutionarily stable against invasion by cheater plants that produce few flowers and abort few to no fruit. This novel mechanism of achieving evolutionarily stable mutualism, namely interspecific population regulation, is qualitatively different from other mechanisms invoking partner choice or selective rewards, and may be a general process that helps to preserve mutualistic interactions in nature.

AB In 1986, a population-based survey of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a rural Florida community showed that HIV prevalence was 28/877 (3.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0, 4.4). In 1998-2000, the authors performed a second population-based survey in this community and a case-control study to determine whether HIV prevalence and risk factors had changed. After 609 addresses had been randomly selected for the survey, 516 (85%) residents were enrolled, and 447 (73%) were tested for HIV. HIV prevalence was 7/447 (1.6%, 95% CI: 0.4, 2.7) in western Palm Beach County and 5/286 (1.7%, 95% CI: 0.2, 3.3) in Belle Glade (p = 0.2 in comparison with 1986). Independent predictors of HIV infection in both 1986 and 1998-2000 were having a history of sexually transmitted disease, number of sex partners, and exchanging money or drugs for sex. A history of having sex with men was a risk factor among men in 1986 but not in 1998-2000; residence in specific neighborhoods was a risk factor in 1998-2000 but not in 1986. The authors conclude that heterosexually acquired HIV infection did not spread throughout the community between 1986 and 1998 but persisted at a low level in discrete neighborhoods. Interventions targeting HIV-endemic neighborhoods will be needed to further reduce HIV prevalence in this area.

TI Mother-to-child transmission of human herpesvirus-8 in South Africa
AB To investigate transmission of human herpesvirus (HHV)-8,2546 mother-child pairs were recruited from rural clinics in South Africa and were tested for antibodies against lytic and latent HHV-8 antigens. The prevalence of antibodies in children increased with increasing maternal antibody titer (lytic, chi(1)(2) and 26 and P<.001; latent, chi(2)(1)=55, and P<.001). HHV-8 DNA was detectable in 145 of 978 maternal saliva samples (mean virus load, 488,450 copies/mL; range, 1550-660,000 copies/mL) and in 12 of 43 breast-milk samples (mean virus load, 5800 copies/mL; range, 1550-12,540 copies/mL). The prevalence of HHV-8 DNA in maternal saliva was unrelated to latent anti-HHV-8 antibody status but was higher in mothers with the highest titers of lytic antibodies than in other mothers (34% vs. 8%; P<.001). The prevalence of lytic anti-HHV-8 antibodies in children was 13% (70/528) if the mother did not have HHV-8 in saliva and was 29% (8/28) if the mother had a high HHV-8 load (>50,000 copies/mL) in saliva (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.2). The presence of HHV-8 DNA in maternal saliva was unrelated to latent antibodies in children. Saliva could be a route of transmission of HHV-8 from person to person, although other routes cannot be ruled out.

TI Viral gene sequences reveal the variable history of hepatitis C virus
   infection among countries
AB Background. The analysis of molecular phylogenies estimated from the gene sequences of sampled viruses can provide important insights into epidemiological processes.
   Methods. The demographic and migration histories of the prevalent hepatitis C virus (HCV) subtypes 1a and 1b were inferred from viral gene sequences sampled in 5 countries. Estimated viral phylogenies were analyzed by use of methods based on parsimony and coalescent theory.
   Results. The parsimony migration analysis suggested that the global subtype 1a and 1b epidemics are geographically structured, with asymmetrical movement of HCV strains among the sampled countries. The coalescent analysis indicated that subtype 1a infections in the United States, Brazil, and Indonesia began to increase exponentially during the 1940s and 1950s, whereas in Vietnam the increase began after the 1970s. In contrast, subtype 1b infections in these 4 countries and in Japan began to increase exponentially between 1880 and 1920, with a possible recent decrease in infection rates in Indonesia and Japan. In the United States, Brazil, and Vietnam, the epidemic growth rates for subtype 1a strains were higher than those for subtype 1b strains, whereas the growth rates were similar in Indonesia.
   Conclusions. The estimated histories of migration and population growth indicated that patterns of HCV transmission differ among countries and viral subtypes.

TI A cost of Wolbachia-induced sex reversal and female-biased sex ratios:
   decrease in female fertility after sperm depletion in a terrestrial
   isopod
AB A number of parasites are vertically transmitted to new host generations via female eggs. In such cases, host reproduction is an intimate component of parasite fitness and no cost of the infection on host reproduction is expected to evolve. A number of these parasites distort host sex ratios towards females, thereby increasing either parasite fitness or the proportion of the host that transmit the parasite. In terrestrial isopods (woodlice), Wolbachia bacteria are responsible for sex reversion and female-biased sex ratios, changing genetic males into functional neo-females. Although sex ratio distortion is a powerful means for parasites to increase in frequency in host populations, it also has potential consequences on host biology, which may, in turn, have consequences for parasite prevalence. We used the woodlouse Annadillidium vulgare to test whether the interaction between Wolbachia infection and the resulting excess of females would limit female fertility through the reduction in sperm number that they receive from males. We showed that multiple male mating induces sperm depletion, and that this sperm depletion affects fertility only in infected females. This decrease in fertility, associated with male mate choice, may limit the spread of Wolbachia infections in host populations.

TI Physiographic and entomologic risk factors of malaria in Assam, India
AB 0Fever surveys were conducted in several districts of the Indian state of Assam to ascertain the prevalence of malaria in relation to vector abundance, entomologic inoculation rates (EIRs), and geographic location of human settlements. Anopheles minimus were incriminated, but their relative abundance and biting rates varied among districts, and no significant correlation was observed between these two indicators (r = 0.43, P = 0.34). Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant parasite species except in two districts where P. vivax was the majority parasite. The EIRs per person/night were 0.46-0.71 in P. falciparum-predominant areas and 0.12 in the district where P. vivax predominated. The correlation of percentage of fever cases positive for malaria infection in each district with the corresponding EIR was not significant (r = 0.6, P = 0.21). Malaria cases were detected in all months of the year but peaked during May-June, which corresponded to the months of heavy rainfall. These were also the months with highest incidence of infection with P. falciparum. Malaria cases were observed in all age groups of both sexes, and there was clustering of cases in villages near the vector-breeding habitat (perennial seepage streams), and foothill villages. However, malaria incidences were consistently lower in villages within 5 km of the nearest health care facility, which were in town areas. The data presented are indicative of low-to-moderate levels of malaria transmission by An. minimus, and would be of value for developing future intervention strategies.

TI Epidemiology of malaria transmission and development of natural immunity
   in a malaria-endemic village, San Dulakudar, in Orissa State, India
AB We describe the epidemiology of malaria in San Dulakudar, a village in Sundargarh District in the state of Orissa in eastern India. Malaria transmission is perennial with Plasmodium falciparum, accounting for greater than 80% of malaria cases. Transmission intensity varies with season with high transmission after the monsoon rains in autumn and winter, low transmission in summer, and intermediate transmission in spring. The anthropophagic mosquito Anopheles fluviatilis was identified as the main vector for malaria transmission. Based on observations of spleen rates and supported by data on malaria parasite prevalence and malaria incidence, San Dulakudar can be classified as a hyperendemic area for P. falciparum malaria. Parasite prevalence and malaria incidence rates decrease with age suggesting that residents of San Dulakudar develop immunity to malaria. The study demonstrates the presence of regions in the Indian subcontinent such as Sundargarh District where P. falciparum is the primary cause of malaria and where malaria transmission rates are comparable to those found in many parts of Africa.

TI Concurrent evolution of resistance and tolerance to pathogens
AB Recent experiments on plant defenses against pathogens or herbivores have shown various patterns of the association between resistance, which reduces the probability of being infected or attacked, and tolerance, which reduces the loss of fitness caused by the infection or attack. Our study describes the simultaneous evolution of these two strategies of defense in a population of hosts submitted to a pathogen. We extended previous approaches by assuming that the two traits are independent ( e. g., determined by two unlinked genes), by modeling different shapes of the costs of defenses, and by taking into account the demographic and epidemiological dynamics of the system. We provide novel predictions on the variability and the evolution of defenses. First, resistance and tolerance do not necessarily exclude each other; second, they should respond in different ways to changes in parameters that affect the epidemiology or the relative costs and benefits of defenses; and third, when comparing investments in defenses among different environments, the apparent associations among resistance, tolerance, and fecundity in the absence of parasites can lead to the false conclusion that only one defense trait is costly. The latter result emphasizes the problems of estimating trade-offs and costs among natural populations without knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.

TI Evolution of Wolbachia cytoplasmic incompatibility types
AB The success of obligate endosymbiotic Wolbachia infections in insects is due in part to cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), whereby Wolbachia bacteria manipulate host reproduction to promote their invasion and persistence within insect populations. The observed diversity of CI types raises the question of what the evolutionary pathways are by which a new CI type can evolve from an ancestral type. Prior evolutionary models assume that Wolbachia exists within a host individual as a clonal infection. While endosymbiotic theory predicts a general trend toward clonality, Wolbachia provides an exception in which there is selection to maintain diversity. Here, evolutionary trajectories are discussed that assume that a novel Wolbachia variant will co-exist with the original infection type within a host individual as a superinfection. Relative to prior models, this assumption relaxes requirements and allows additional pathways for the evolution of novel CI types. In addition to describing changes in the Wolbachia infection frequency associated with the hypothesized evolutionary events, the predicted impact of novel CI variants on the host population is also described. This impact, resulting from discordant evolutionary interests of symbiont and host, is discussed as a possible cause of Wolbachia loss from the host population or host population extinction. The latter is also discussed as the basis for an applied strategy for the suppression of insect pest populations. Model predictions are discussed relative to a recently published Wolbachia genome sequence and prior characterization of CI in naturally and artificially infected insects.

TI Costs of an induced immune response on sexual display and longevity in
   field crickets
AB Immune system activation may benefit hosts by generating resistance to parasites. However, natural resources are usually limited, causing a trade-off between the investment in immunity and that in other life-history or sexually selected traits. Despite its importance for the evolution of host defense, state-dependent fitness costs of immunity received little attention under natural conditions. In a field experiment we manipulated the nutritional condition of male field crickets Gryllus campestris and subsequently investigated the effect of an induced immune response through inoculation of bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Immune system activation caused a condition-dependent reduction in body condition, which was proportional to the condition-gain during the preceding food-supplementation period. Independent of nutritional condition, the immune insult induced an enduring reduction in daily calling rate, whereas control-injected males fully regained their baseline level of sexual signaling following a temporary decline. Since daily calling rate affects female mate choice under natural conditions, this suggests a decline in male mating success as a cost of induced immunity. Food supplementation enhanced male life span, whereas the immune insult reduced longevity, independent of nutritional status. Thus, immune system activation ultimately curtails male fitness due to a combined decline in sexual display and life span. Our field study thus indicates a key role for fitness costs of induced immunity in the evolution of host defense. In particular, costs expressed in sexually selected traits might warrant the honest advertisement of male health status, thus representing an important mechanism in parasite-mediated sexual selection.

TI Genetic correlation between melanization and antibacterial immune
   responses in a natural population of the malaria vector Anopheles
   gambiae
AB The immune system of invertebrates can mount different responses, including melanotic encapsulation and several antibacterial defense mechanisms. Variation of the efficacies of these responses is generally considered to be a product of the evolutionary pressure on each response due to infection by parasites. However, potential interactions and trade-offs among the different responses of the immune system could constrain the evolutionary potential of each response. In a natural population of the mosquito Anopheles ganibiae, we measured the genetic association between the melanization response and an antibacterial response in two environmental qualities (well-fed and undernourished larvae). In both environments the two immune responses were positively genetically correlated: in full-sib families that were most likely to melanize a bead, injected bacteria were most likely to be cleared. Thus, our data do not support the idea of a trade-off among different outcomes of the invertebrate immune system, but rather that some families are overall immunologically superior to others.

TI Maternal antibody transmission and breeding densities in the
   Black-headed Gull Larus ridibundus
AB 1. The offspring of avian species, especially those of colonial breeders, are exposed to a number of pathogens immediately after birth. The chick's immune system is, at that early stage still immature and inefficient. As a consequence, diseases can have a strong impact on chick survival.
   2. The ability of mothers to transmit passive immunity in terms of antibodies of their own acquired immunity to their chicks is probably an essential pathway to enhance the chick survival. Since the production of antibodies is costly, females are expected to adjust the transmission of passive immunity to the local disease environment.
   3. We found that in Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus L.) yolk antibody concentrations are positively correlated with local breeding density. This transmission pattern is likely to be adaptive, as the aggregation of birds will enhance the local presence of pathogens.
   4. When birds were forced to re-settle after the colony had been flooded (10-20% of the original number of breeding pairs re-settled), this relationship was no longer present. The lack of such a relationship may be explained by the fact that females may retain certain levels of antibodies as a consequence of infections that occurred during the first breeding attempt at a different breeding density.
   5. Within clutches, maternal antibodies decreased with laying sequence, in particular in eggs hatching male chicks. This transmission pattern may contribute to the observed mortality pattern found in gull species.

TI Pathogenesis of urinary tract infections with normal female anatomy
AB Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common among girls and young women who are healthy and have anatomically normal urinary tracts. These infections are a main source of morbidity and health-care costs in this population. The interaction between specific infecting bacteria and urinary tract epithelium characteristics underlies the pathogenesis of this disease. Several pathogen-related factors predispose people to recurrent UTI including periurethral bacterial colonisation and Escherichia coli virulence. Host behavioural risk factors include voiding dysfunction, high intercourse frequency, and oral contraceptive and spermicide use. The role of vesicoureteral reflux in recurrent childhood UTI is probably overestimated in the medical literature and is important only in a small group of children with high-grade reflux. Family pedigree analysis suggests a familial genetic predisposition for UTI among young females. Animal models show the multigenic nature of recurrent UTI. Putative candidate genes for the disease include ABH blood groups, interleukin-8 receptor (CXCR1), the human leucocyte antigen locus, toll-like receptors, tumour necrosis factor, and Tamm-Horsfall protein.

TI Genetic variation in eastern North American and putatively introduced
   populations of Ceratocystis fimbriata f. platani
AB The plant pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata f. platani attacks Platanus species (London plane, oriental plane and American sycamore) and has killed tens of thousands of plantation trees and street trees in the eastern United States, southern Europe and Modesto, California. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA fingerprints and alleles of eight polymorphic microsatellite markers of isolates of C. fimbriata from these regions delineated major differences in gene diversities. The 33 isolates from the eastern United States had a moderate degree of gene diversity, and unique genotypes were found at each of seven collection sites. Fingerprints of 27 isolates from 21 collection sites in southern Europe were identical with each other; microsatellite markers were monomorphic within the European population, except that three isolates differed at one locus each, due perhaps to recent mutations. The genetic variability of C. fimbriata f. platani in the eastern United States suggests that the fungus is indigenous to this region. The genetic homogeneity of the fungus in Europe suggests that this population has gone through a recent genetic bottleneck, perhaps from the introduction of a single genotype. This supports the hypothesis that the pathogen was introduced to Europe through Naples, Italy during World War II on infected crating material from the eastern United States. The Californian population may also have resulted from introduction of one or a few related genotypes because it, too, had a single nuclear and mitochondrial genotype and limited variation in microsatellite alleles.

TI Mortality in cultures of the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae during
   culture senescence and darkness
AB The study of cell death in higher plants and animals has revealed the existence of an active ('programmed') process in most types of cell, and similarities in cell death between plants, animals, yeast and bacteria suggest an evolutionarily ancient origin of programmed cell death (PCD). Despite their global importance in primary production, information on algal cell death is limited. Algal cell death could have similarities with metazoan cell death. One morphotype of metazoan PCD, apoptosis, can be induced by light deprivation in the unicellular chlorophyte Dunaliella tertiolecta. The situation in other algal taxa is less clear. We used a model dinoflagellate (Amphidinium carterae) to test whether mortality during darkness and culture senescence showed apoptotic characteristics. Using transmission electron microscopy, fluorescent biomarkers, chlorophyll fluorescence and particulate carbon analysis we analysed the process of cell mortality and found that light deprivation caused mass mortality. By contrast, fewer dead cells (5-20% of the population) were found in late-phase cultures, while a similar degenerate cell morphology (shrunken, chlorotic) was observed. On morphological grounds, our observations suggest that the apoptotic cell death described in D. tertiolecta does not occur in A. carterae. Greater similarity was found with paraptosis, a recently proposed alternative morphotype of PCD. A paraptotic conclusion is supported by inconclusive DNA fragmentation results. We emphasize the care that must be taken in transferring fundamental paradigms between phylogenetically diverse cell types and we argue for a greater consistency in the burden of proof needed to assign causality to cell death processes.

TI Parasite-mediated selection in experimental metapopulations of Daphnia
   magna
AB In metapopulations, only a fraction of all local host populations may be infected with a given parasite species, and limited dispersal of parasites suggests that colonization of host populations by parasites may involve only a small number of parasite strains. Using hosts and parasites obtained from a natural metapopulation, we studied the evolutionary consequences of invasion by single strains of parasites in experimental populations of the cyclical parthenogen Daphnia magna. In two experiments, each spanning approximately one season, we monitored clone frequency changes in outdoor container populations consisting of 13 and 19 D. magna clones, respectively. The populations were either infected with single strains of the microsporidian parasites Octosporea bayeri or Ordospora colligata or left unparasitized. In both experiments, infection changed the representation of clones over time significantly, indicating parasite-mediated evolution in the experimental populations. Furthermore, the two parasite species changed clone frequencies differently, suggesting that the interaction between infection and competitive ability of the hosts was specific to the parasite species. Taken together, our results suggest that parasite strains that invade local host populations can lead to evolutionary changes in the genetic composition of the host population and that this change is parasite species specific.

TI Transmission rates and adaptive evolution of pathogens in sympatric
   heterogeneous plant populations
AB Diversification in agricultural cropping patterns is widely practised to delay the build-up of virulent races that can overcome host resistance in pathogen populations. This can lead to balanced polymorphism, but the long-term consequences of this strategy for the evolution of crop pathogen populations are still unclear. The widespread occurrence of sibling species and reproductively isolated sub-species among fungal and oomycete plant pathogens suggests that evolutionary divergence is common.
   This paper develops a mathematical model of host-pathogen interactions using a simple framework of two hosts to analyse the influences of sympatric host heterogeneity on the long-term evolutionary behaviour of plant pathogens. Using adaptive dynamics, which assumes that sequential mutations induce small changes in pathogen fitness, we show that evolutionary outcomes strongly depend on the shape of the trade-off curve between pathogen transmission on sympatric hosts. In particular, we determine the conditions under which the evolutionary branching of a monomorphic into a dimorphic population occurs, as well as the conditions that lead to the evolution of specialist (single host range) or generalist (multiple host range) pathogen populations.

TI Towards a strategic plan for research to support the global program to
   eliminate lymphatic filariasis - Summary of immediate needs and
   opportunities for research on lymphatic filariasis identified by the
   Filariasis community of scientists in association with an "LF research
   forum", convened in Philadelphia, December 9-10, 2003
AB The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF), now four years old and clearly providing enormous health benefits from its broad deworming effects in the poorest sectors of the developing world, represents a societal investment already measured in the tens of millions of dollars. Despite rapid progress in scaling up the program to more than 38 endemic countries (or perhaps even because of this rapid progress), there is one element essential for ultimate program success that is now being severely neglected-research, both operational and basic (upstream).
   The dramatic research successes in developing effective tools and strategies during the 1980s and 1990s provided the foundation for the GPELF. Generous public-private partnerships enabled its implementation, in concert with the 1997 formal resolution by the World Health Assembly calling for the elimination of LF as a public health problem worldwide.
   Implementation alone, however, does not guarantee success. An essential characteristic of all successful public health programs is the continuing involvement of an active research community ready to provide solutions for program problems as they arise and for anticipated problems or barriers that might appear during program activities. Indeed, such operational research must be especially vigorous and focused in programs (such as the GPELF) with a time-limited goal for disease elimination. For lessons to be learned, program strategies improved, and activities made more effective and cost-efficient, there must be a problem-solving research community actively engaged with the ongoing program initiatives and focused on their challenges. Furthermore, for diseases such as LF, the neglected 10/90 diseases of poverty, where research funds are particularly limited, it is especially critical that the most acute research needs of the program be accurately identified, effectively prioritized, and clearly laid out so that the research community and the organizations supporting it can recognize the most important opportunities available and focus their resources accordingly.
   It was toward this end that efforts were made during 2003-2004 to gather diverse and valued input from a very broad representation of the filariasis community, both program and research oriented. More than 90 research, clinical, and public health experts in LF came together in meetings (Annexes 1-3) and deliberations for the purpose of creating a comprehensive, collective assessment of today's LF research horizon and research needs. While there was broad agreement that the GPELF remains very much on target, in-depth assessments were made of ways to improve program support or increase understanding for each of the most important issues related to operational and basic, upstream research. For each of these domains, needs and opportunities were first defined and then prioritized.
   For program-oriented, operational research the greatest needs fall into four clusters:
   1) to establish the tools and measures of program success by
   a) evaluating comparatively the diagnostics and sampling strategies available, both in humans and in vectors,
   b) testing the endpoints for declaring transmission interruption,
   c) creating/testing sets of indicators developed to monitor
   i) morbidity-control/disability-prevention efforts,
   ii) multi-disease integrated program activities,
   iii) the GPELF impact on national health systems,
   2) to enhance current program effectiveness by
   a) identifying adjunctive measures that could reduce the number of mass drug administrations (MDAs) required to achieve success (e.g., vector control, modified regimens of available drugs),
   b) refining predictive models for decision-making,
   c) improving methods and tools to treat difficult populations (especially urban and Loa-endemic communities),
   d) integrating LF programs with others having cost-effective complementarities,
   e) optimizing social mobilization techniques, and
   f) developing creative advocacy and fundraising strategies,
   3) to ensure good clinical/morbidity management by
   a) standardizing clinical terminology and technical approaches to patient assessment,
   b) establishing best practices for home-based care for lymphedema, surgical care for hydrocoele/tymphocoele, and treatment for individuals with LF infection,
   c) assessing reversibility of clinical/subclinical LF disease,
   4) to protect effectiveness of drug-based PELFs by
   a) establishing a definition for decreasing drug sensitivity,
   b) developing parasite repositories and surveillance for genotypic signs of drug resistance,
   c) continuing new and alternative drug development.
   Particularly important for upstream research study are those issues defining the
   1) effect of LF co-infections on clinical expression of other diseases and on responsiveness to routine vaccines,
   2) mechanisms that determine the pathogenesis of lymphatic disease and its clinical expression,
   3) susceptibility and resistance to LF and the effect of MDA on natural immunity to LF in treated populations,
   4) genomics and proteomics of filarial parasites
   It is clear that public health programs require both implementers and problem solvers. When problems loom large, society invests greatly in problem solving (i.e., research). When solutions are found, investments appropriately shift towards implementation. It is essential to recognize, however, that the need for problem solving (even to develop increased program efficiencies or cost-effectiveness) remains, and if not supported, threatens the very success of the program, putting at risk not only society's initial investment but also the health and welfare of the underserved populations for whom the program was created. The LF Research Community and their programmatic colleagues have deliberated extensively to define how best to strengthen the GPELF to ensure its immediate success and to enhance its research base to ensure longterm availability of problem solving research to provide solutions for program needs that are sure to arise. The clearer understanding that has emerged now promises to create a much stronger, more effective partnership between the implementing and research communities of the GPELF and the public and private funding organizations whose support is so essential for program success.

TI Short report: Detection probability of arbovirus infection in mosquito
   populations
AB An important component of arbovirus surveillance is monitoring the vector for presence of the pathogen. Intervention and preventive programs need early detection of arboviral activity in mosquito populations. In this report, we examine the factors affecting the probability of detection of mosquito infections. Since arbovirus infection rates in mosquito populations are very low, observations of zero-infected mosquito samples are common. Using statistical models, we describe methods to estimate the probability of detection and upper bounds of confidence intervals of mosquito infection rates as measures of confidence for observations of zero infection. Our results show that detection of low levels of mosquito infections requires large samples (greater than 1,600 individuals) for a high probability (0.8) of detection. Due to focal transmission of arboviruses, grouping samples over different sampling sites and times is often inappropriate for detection of mosquito infection. We emphasize sample size as a key determinant in detection of mosquito infections and recommend intensified entomologic surveys at sentinel sites to detect arboviral activity.

TI Population dynamics of pathogens with multiple host species
AB Pathogens that can infect multiple host species will have different dynamics than pathogens that are restricted to a single species of host. This article examines the conditions for establishment and long-term population dynamic behavior of pathogens that infect multiple species of hosts. The article attempts to address three major questions in this area: First, under which conditions will increases in the diversity of host species buffer infectious disease outbreaks, and under which conditions will host diversity amplify disease outbreaks? Second, under what conditions is it possible to control an infectious agent by focusing control against only one host species? Third, what role does host species diversity play in maintaining pathogen persistence? The answers to these questions supply some important general insights into the role that biodiversity plays in buffering humans and other species against new and emerging pathogens.

TI The evolution of virulence when parasites cause host castration and
   gigantism
AB It has been suggested that the harm parasites cause to their hosts is an unavoidable consequence of parasite reproduction with costs not only for the host but also for the parasite. Castrating parasites are thought to minimize their costs by reducing host fecundity, which may minimize the chances of killing both host and parasite prematurely. We conducted a series of experiments to understand the evolution of virulence of a castrating bacterium in the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. By manipulating food levels during the infection of D. magna with the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa, we showed that both antagonists are resource-limited and that a negative correlation between host and parasite reproduction exists, indicating resource competition among the antagonists. Pasteuria ramosa also induces enhanced growth of its hosts (gigantism), which we found to be negatively correlated with host fecundity but positively correlated with parasite reproduction. Because infected hosts never recovered from infections, we concluded that gigantism is beneficial only for the parasite. Hosts, however, have evolved counter-adaptations. We showed that infected hosts have enhanced reproduction before castration. This shift to earlier reproduction increases overall host fecundity and compromises parasite reproduction. Finally, we showed that this resource conflict is subject to genetic variation among host and parasite genotypes within a population and is therefore likely to be an important force in the coevolution of virulence in this system. A verbal model is presented and suggests that the adaptive value of gigantism is to store host resources, which are liberated after parasitic castration for later use by the growing parasite. This hypothesis assumes that infections are long lasting, that is, that they have a high life expectancy.

TI Ecology and evolution of host-pathogen interactions in nature
AB The rates of new diseases outbreaking in natural ecosystems are on the rise. Although work on pathogens in natural ecosystems always lags far behind human and agricultural systems, substantial progress has been made in understanding these interactions. This special issue presents studies across a range of natural ecosystems, including terrestrial, freshwater, and marine. Theory of host-pathogen interactions drives the focus on questions about natural controls on epizootics in nature, the source of new variant disease strains, the nature of host resistance and parasite virulence, the effects of host species diversity on pathogen prevalence, and the speed of evolution of hosts and pathogens. Studying these interactions in nature brings us to the heart of prominent issues in the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity. These studies pinpoint future priorities in understanding natural dynamics of host resistance and pathogen virulence and factors controlling infectious spread in multispecies communities.

TI The rise and fall of a six-year coral-fungal epizootic
AB Drivers of disease cycles are poorly understood in marine ecosystems in spite of increasing outbreaks. We monitored a newly emerged fungal epizootic (aspergillosis) affecting sea fan corals (Gorgonia ventalina L.) in the Florida Keys to evaluate causes of its rise and fall over 6 years. Since August 1997, aspergillosis has nearly eradicated large sea fans at some sites. However, sea fan densities have remained relatively constant due to episodic recruitment replacing large fans with small. Recruitment itself was affected by infection and occurred only when prevalence of disease was low. This impact on recruitment occurred because the largest, potentially most fecund colonies had the highest prevalence of disease, and the pathogen significantly suppressed reproduction of infected fans. Moreover, high mortality among adults resulted in a demographic shift to smaller colonies. The most dramatic impact of aspergillosis was the Keys-wide loss of >50% of sea fan tissue from complete and partial mortality. Aspergillosis prevalence has declined steadily over the last 6 years, and we consider the following hypotheses for decline of the epizootic: change in environment, change in pathogen input, and increase in host resistance. We conclude that increasing host resistance is the most likely driver of the decline. However, a change in any of a number of factors, for example, recruitment of naive hosts, rate of pathogen input, or environmental conditions (water quality and temperature), is likely to promote reemergence of the epizootic.

TI Host sex and local adaptation by parasites in a snail-trematode
   interaction
AB One of the leading theories for the evolutionary stability of sex in eukaryotes relies on parasite-mediated selection against locally common host genotypes (the Red Queen hypothesis). As such, parasites would be expected to be better at infecting sympatric host populations than allopatric host populations. Here we examined all published and unpublished infection experiments on a Snail-trematode system (Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Microphallus sp., respectively). A meta-analysis demonstrated significant local adaptation by the parasite, and a variance components analysis showed that the variance due to the host-parasite interaction far exceeded the variance due to the main effects of host source and parasite source. The meta-analysis also indicated that asexual host populations were more resistant to allopatric sources of parasites than were (mostly) sexual host populations, but we found no significant differences among parasite populations in the strength of local adaptation. This result suggests that triploid asexual snails are more resistant to remote sources of parasites, but the parasite has, through coevolution, overcome the difference. Finally, we found that the degree of local adaptation did not depend on the genetic distance among host populations. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the parasites are adapted, on average, to infecting their local host populations and suggest that they may be a factor in selecting against common host genotypes in natural populations.

TI Parasites and the evolutionary diversification of primate clades
AB Coevolutionary interactions such as those between hosts and parasites have been regarded as an underlying cause of evolutionary diversification, but evidence from natural populations is limited. Among primates and other mammalian groups, measures of host diversification rates vary widely among lineages, but comparative studies have not yet identified a reliable explanation for this variation. In this study, we used a comprehensive data set of disease-causing organisms from free-living primates to illustrate how phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to examine mammalian lineage diversity in relation to parasite species richness. Our results provide evidence that the phylogenetic diversity of primate clades is correlated positively with the number of parasite species harbored by each host and that this pattern is largely independent of other host traits that have been shown to influence diversification rates and parasite species richness in primates. We investigated two possible mechanisms that could explain this association, namely that parasites themselves drive host evolutionary diversification through processes linked with sexual selection and that host shifts or host sharing increases parasite species richness among diverse primate clades. Neither parasite species richness nor host diversification is related to measures of sexual selection in primates. Further, we found only partial evidence that more rapidly diversifying host lineages produced increased opportunities for host sharing or host shifting by parasites through mechanisms involving species' geographic range overlap. Thus, our analyses provide evidence for an important link between the evolutionary diversification of primates and the richness of their parasite communities, but other mechanisms, particularly those related to reciprocal selection or coextinction of hosts and parasites, require further investigation.

TI Pathogen spillover in disease epidemics
AB In field experiments manipulating generalist pathogens and host community composition, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species drove disease dynamics in multiple nonreservoir species, sometimes decreasing their abundance through apparent competition. The dynamics of generalist pathogens in multispecies host communities remain a major frontier for disease ecology. Of particular interest are how host community structure controls pathogen transmission and how disease spread feeds back to influence the host community. Pathogen spillover occurs when epidemics in a host population are driven not by transmission within that population but by transmission from a reservoir population. Here we review examples of spillover in pathogens infecting humans, domesticated animals, and crops, noting that most empirical evidence for spillover results from nonmanipulative, observational studies. We then present results from two field experiments utilizing an experimentally tractable model system of annual wild grasses and a generalist virus, the barley yellow dwarf virus. In these experiments, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species, Avena fatua (wild oats), greatly increased pathogen prevalence in several other species. This result demonstrates pathogen spillover and illustrates the crucial role of host community structure in controlling the dynamics of generalist pathogens. Further, pathogen spillover from A. fatua decreased the abundance of two other host species through pathogen-mediated apparent competition. Thus, our results provide experimental support for theoretical predictions of strong feedbacks between host community structure and generalist disease dynamics.

TI Do hosts and parasites coevolve? Empirical support from the Schistosoma
   system
AB Coevolution between host and parasite is, in principle, a powerful determinant of the biology and genetics of infection and disease. However, coevolution is difficult to demonstrate rigorously in practice and therefore has rarely been observed empirically, particularly in animal-parasite systems. Research on host-schistosome interactions has the potential for making an important contribution to the study of coevolution or reciprocal adaptation. This may be particularly pertinent because schistosomes represent an indirectly transmitted macroparasite, so often overlooked among both theoretical and empirical studies. Here we present ideas and experiments on host-schistosome interactions, in part reviewed from published work but focusing in particular on preliminary novel data from our ongoing studies of potential host-schistosome evolution and coevolution in the laboratory. The article is split into three main sections: we first focus on the evidence for evolution in the host, then in the parasite, before combining both to illustrate the gathering evidence of host-parasite coevolution in the snail-schistosome system. In particular, we demonstrate that genetic architecture, variability, and selective pressures are present for the evolution of resistance and susceptibility virulence, and infectivity to occur, the mechanisms allowing such polymorphisms to be maintained, and that hosts and parasites appear to have reciprocal effects on each other's phenotype and genotype.

TI Interrelationships among inbreeding, herbivory, and disease on
   reproduction in a wild gourd
AB Because inbreeding, herbivory, and disease are common in plants and their separate impacts on fitness are well documented, investigators have begun to examine the consequences of inbreeding on plant-herbivore and plant-pathogen interactions. In this study, we examined the interrelationships among inbreeding, herbivory, and disease on reproductive output through both male (pollen production and pollen performance) and female (fruit and seed production and seed germination) functions. Inbred (selfed) and outbred plants from five families of a wild gourd (Cucurbita pepo ssp. texana) were grown in five 0.2-ha randomized blocks in an experimental garden. Half of the inbred and half of the outbred plants were sprayed weekly with a contact pesticide to control herbivores. The other half of the plants served as the controls (no-spray treatment). The spray treatment significantly reduced damage by cucumber beetles and aphid infestation levels, the two primary herbivores of the wild gourd. Moreover, because these herbivores are the sole vectors for the five most common viral diseases of cucurbits (Watermelon mosaic-2, Cucumber mosaic, Zucchini yellow mosaic, Papaya ringspot, and Squash mosaic), the spray treatment also significantly reduced the amount and severity of the symptoms of viral diseases. Our analyses reveal that (1) there is variation for resistance to herbivores and pathogens among the five families used in the Study, indicating that there is broad-sense heritability for resistance; (2) inbred plants suffer greater herbivore damage and have more symptoms of viral infection than outbred plants, i.e., there is inbreeding depression for herbivore/pathogen resistance; (3) the impacts of insecticide applications and inbreeding on reproduction are mostly additive; (4) both male and female functions are significantly affected by the spray treatment and inbreeding; and (5) the adverse effects of both inbreeding and the increased exposure to herbivores/pathogens in the no-spray treatment are greater for female function than for male function, indicating that the impact of genetic and environmental stress can differentially affect the two sexual functions. Together, these findings have important implications for the evolution of selfing, the conservation of small populations, and the establishment and transmission of diseases within populations.

   disturbance frequency
AB Patterns of community and population diversity are likely to be dependent on interactions between ecological variables. Here we address how two important ecological variables - extrinsic periodic mortality events (disturbances) and the presence of obligate-killing parasites - interact to affect the diversity of niche-specialist genotypes in laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. Consistent with previous studies, diversity was maximized at intermediate frequencies of disturbance in the absence of parasitic bacteriophages (phages). By contrast, no relationship was found between diversity and disturbance frequency in the presence of phage. The results can be explained in part by differential effects of phage on bacterial densities, and hence resource competition, under different disturbance regimes.

TI Nonlinear effects of female mate choice in wild threespine sticklebacks
AB Sexual selection by mate choice represents a very important selective pressure in many animal species and might have evolutionary impacts beyond exaggeration of secondary sexual traits. Describing the shape and strength of the relationships linking mating success and nonsexual traits in natural conditions represents a challenging step in our understanding of adaptive evolution. We studied the effect of behavioral (nest site choice), immunological (trematode level of infection), genetic diversity (measured by mean d(2)) and morphological (standard length and pectoral fin size) traits on male mating success in a natural population of threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteaus aculeatus. Male mating success was measured by microsatellite genotyping of embryos used to infer female genotypes. First, we analyzed all territorial males (full analysis) but also considered independently only males with a nonzero mating success (reduced analysis) because some of the males with no eggs could have been part of a later breeding cycle. Multiple linear regressions identified a significant negative effect of parasite load in the full analysis, whereas no linear effect was found in the reduced analysis. The quadratic analyses revealed that nest location and parasite load were significantly related to mating success by positive (concave selection) and negative (convex selection) quadratic coefficients respectively, resulting in a saddle-shaped fitness surface. Moreover, there were significant interactions between nest location, mean d2 and parasite load in the reduced analysis. The subsequent canonical rotation of the matrix of quadratic and cross-product terms identified two major axes of the response surface: a vector representing mostly nest site choice and a vector representing parasite load. These results imply that there exists more than one way for a male threespine stickleback to maximize its mating success and that such nonlinear relationships between male mating success induced by female mate choice and male characteristics might have been overlooked in many studies.

TI Evidence for maintenance of sex by pathogens in plants
AB The predominance of outcrossing despite the substantial transmission advantage of self-fertilization remains a paradox. Theory suggests that selection can favor outcrossing if it enables the production of offspring that are less susceptible to pathogen attack than offspring produced via self-fertilization. Thus, if pathogen pressure is contributing to the maintenance of outcrossing in plants, there may be a positive correlation between the number of pathogen species attacking plant species and the outcrossing rate of the plant species. We tested this hypothesis by examining the association between outcrossing rate and the number of fungal pathogen species that attack a large, taxonomically diverse set of seed plants. We show that plant species attacked by more fungal pathogen species have higher outcrossing rates than plants with fewer enemies. This relationship persists after correcting for study bias among natural and agricultural species of plants. We also accounted for the nested hierarchy of relationships among plant lineages by conducting phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) within genera and families that were adequately represented in our dataset. A meta-analysis of the correlation between pathogen and outcrossing PICs shows that there is a positive correlation between pathogen species number and outcrossing rates. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that pathogen-mediated selection may contribute to the maintenance of outcrossing in species of seed plants.

TI On the relationship between T-cell mediated immunity in bird species and
   the establishment success of introduced populations
AB 1. The introduction of animals to novel environments has been used as a model system for investigating the factors affecting small populations during their initial period of establishment. Previous studies of introduction success in birds have identified a number of factors associated with successful establishment.
   2. We predicted that species with strong non-specific immune responses would have an elevated probability of establishment because they would be better able to cope with parasites in the novel environment. Consistent with this prediction, we found that nestling T-cell mediated immune response, as reflected by the response to a challenge with the mitogenic lectin phytohaemagglutinin, was a reliable estimator of establishment success. In multivariate analyses that took previously identified predictors into account, this was only the case when propagule sizes of introduced birds were large.
   3. These findings suggest that host-parasite interactions can be an important component influencing the fate of small populations in novel environments only when severe disease or virulent parasites are more likely to have been introduced as well.

TI Low proportions of reproducing hemiclonal females increase the stability
   of a sexual parasite-host system (Rana esculenta, R-lessonae)
AB 1. The number of reproductive events per lifetime affects all levels of ecological complexity, including the structure and dynamics of species communities. Here we investigate a sexual parasite-host system with two water frog species of which one (Rana esculenta, E) is a hemiclonal hybrid that depends on one of its parental species (R. lessonae, L) for successful reproduction. Previous theoretical models have shown that relative fecundities are important for the species composition and stability of this system, but empirical data from natural mixed LE-populations were lacking.
   2. We used three different methods to estimate the proportion of annually reproducing hybrid and parental females: (a) screening for eggs through a tiny incision into the belly skin, (b) measuring plasma hormone titres from blood samples and (c) counts of egg clumps deposited into the pond.
   3. After accounting for the respective adult population sizes of the two female types - calculated from mark-recapture analyses - we found that all three estimates revealed a higher proportion of reproducing L- than E-females. Ratios ranged from 1.43 (method c), to 1.90 (a) to 2.38 (b), with an average of 1.90.
   4. We also investigated three potential causes for the fecundity difference (age structure, hybrid sterility and differences in reproductive costs) but could not find compelling evidence for any of them. We hypothesize that size-related differences in energy budgets offer the most probable explanation.
   5. The consequences of the observed species differences in annual reproductive success were analysed with a theoretical model. The higher proportion of reproducing R. lessonae females increases the possibilities for stable coexistence in mixed LE-populations under a variety of combinations of mating patterns, relative fecundity and larval performance. The results, however, also indicate new limits for coexistence and highlight the paramount importance of larval competition for explaining the composition and dynamics of mixed LE-populations.

TI Does tuberculosis increase HIV load?
AB Background. The effect that tuberculosis ( TB) has on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression is not clearly understood.
   Methods. In an observational cohort study of HIV-infected adults in South Africa, baseline and final HIV load were compared between individuals who experienced an episode of TB (n = 30) during follow- up and control subjects (n = 56) matched by baseline CD4 cell count and follow- up time; linear regression modeling was used to control for confounding.
   Results. Mean HIV load was higher in the TB group than in the non-TB control group for both baseline (4.73 vs. 4.24 log(10) copies/mL; P = .003) and final values (5.02 vs. 4.34 log(10) copies/mL; P < .001). After adjustment for baseline HIV load and World Health Organization HIV stage, the difference in final HIV load was 0.24 log 10 copies/mL (95% confidence interval, - 0.01 to 0.50 log(10) copies/mL; P = .06).
   Conclusions. Poor prognosis for HIV-infected individuals after TB may be due to preexisting high HIV load rather than to the TB event itself. An episode of TB was associated with a small adjusted increase in HIV load at the end of the study - an increase that would not be regarded as clinically significant in an individual but could have some effect on HIV disease progression or HIV transmission at the population level. Prevention of TB is important for the reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality; however, antiretroviral therapy is required to have a major effect on survival in individuals with HIV disease.

TI The aetiology, origins, and diagnosis of severe acute respiratory
   syndrome
AB Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that first emerged in Guangdong province, China, in November, 2002. A novel coronavirus was later identified in patients with SARS. The detection of the virus in these patients, its absence in healthy controls or other patients with atypical pneumonia, and the reproduction of a similar disease in a relevant animal model fulfilled Koch's postulates for implicating this coronavirus as the causal agent of SARS. The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the virus's identification. The rapid progress in the aetiology, the development of laboratory diagnostic tests, and the defining of routes of viral transmission were facilitated through a unique WHO-coordinated virtual network of laboratories, which shared information on a real-time basis through daily teleconferences. Subsequent studies have indicated that the SARS coronavirus is of animal origin, that its precursor is still present in animal populations within the region, and that live-animal markets in southern China may have provided the animal-human interphase that allowed this precursor virus to adapt to human-human transmission. These findings underscore the potential for the re-emergence of SARS and the need for laboratory tests for early diagnosis. However, the low viral load in the respiratory tract makes early diagnosis of SARS a diagnostic challenge, although improvements in the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic methods continue to be made.

TI T helper cell type 2 responsiveness predicts future susceptibility to
   gastrointestinal nematodes in humans
AB Some humans are persistently more susceptible to gastrointestinal nematodes than others. Here, for the first time, susceptibility to reinfection has been linked to host cytokine responses. Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura abundance was assessed immediately before and 8-9 months after deworming in a Cameroonian population (starting n = 191). Profiles of whole-blood cytokine responses to parasite antigens (for interleukin [IL]-5, IL-13, IL-10, IL-12p40, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma), assayed before treatment, were significantly related both to an overall measure of host susceptibility and to susceptibility to reinfection. Significant effects were primarily due to a negative association between IL-13 and IL-5 responses and infection. Persistently susceptible individuals were, therefore, characterized by a weak T helper cell type 2 response. The apparent plasticity of age-specific cytokine response-worm abundance relationships between different populations is also discussed.

TI Malaria morbidity among school children living in two areas of
   contrasting transmission in western Kenya
AB Research in malaria-endemic areas is usually focused on malaria during early childhood. Less is known about malaria among older school age children. The incidence of clinical attacks of malaria was monitored, using active case detection in primary schools, in two areas of western Kenya that differ in the intensity of transmission. Clinical malaria was more common in schools in the Nandi highlands, with a six-fold higher incidence of malaria attacks during the malaria epidemic in 2002, compared with school children living in a holoendemic area with intense perennial transmission during the same period. The high incidence coupled with the high parasite densities among cases is compatible with a low level of protective immunity in the highlands. The malaria incidence among school children exposed to intense year-round transmission (26 per 100 school children per year) was consistent with reports from other holoendemic areas. Taken together with other published studies, the data suggest that malaria morbidity among school age children increases as transmission intensity decreases. The implications for malaria control are discussed.

TI Influence of chemotherapy on the Plasmodium gametocyte sex ratio of mice
   and humans
AB Plasmodium species, the etiologic agents of malaria, are obligatory sexual organisms. Gametocytes, the precursors of gametes, are responsible for parasite transmission from human to mosquito. The sex ratio of gametocytes has been shown to have consequences for the success of this shift from vertebrate host to insect vector. We attempted to document the effect of chemotherapy on the sex ratio of two different Plasmodium species: Plasmodium falciparum in children from endemic area with uncomplicated malaria treated with chloroquine (CQ) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and P. vinckei petteri in mice treated with CQ or untreated. The studies involved 53 patients without gametocytes at day 0 (13 CQ and 40 SP) followed for 14 days, and 15 mice (10 CQ and 5 controls) followed for five days. During the course of infection, a positive correlation was observed between the time of the length of infection and the proportion of male gametocytes in both Plasmodium species. No effects of treatment (CQ versus SP for P. falciparum or CO versus controls for P. vinckei petteri) on the gametocyte sex ratio were found for either Plasmodium species. This indicates that parasites do not respond to chemotherapy by altering their sex allocation strategy, even though, in the case of P. falciparum, they apparently increase their overall investment in sexual stages. This suggests that malaria parasite species respond to different environmental cues for their sex differentiation and sex determination.

TI Intraspecific nucleotide variation in Anopheles gambiae: New insights
   into the biology of malaria vectors
AB The Anopheles gambiae genome sequence, together with the recent development of molecular tools for genome-wide analysis, promises new insights into the biology of the malaria vector. These insights should help define the best possible breakdown point for interrupting transmission in the mosquito vector. A survey of the intraspecific nucleotide diversity in coding regions of three different mosquito strains showed an average of one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) every 125 coding base pairs. High levels of nucleotide polymorphism were observed in mosquito immune-related genes and pathogen recognition receptors harbored higher replacement substitutions. Genotyping at SNP loci in natural populations of An. gambiae from three malaria foci showed contrasting patterns. The distribution of mutation Y443H in the thioester-containing protein 3 (TEP3) gene suggested this mutational event has occurred under selective constraints. Our results show that SNP-based studies will be valuable in identifying the sequence variation associated with phenotypic traits shaping vector competence.

TI Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, southern Mexico
AB Equine epizootics of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) occurred in the southern Mexican states of Chiapas in 1993 and Oaxaca in 1996. To assess the impact of continuing circulation of VEE virus (VEEV) on human and animal populations, serologic and viral isolation studies were conducted in 2000 to 2001 in Chiapas State. Human serosurveys and risk analyses indicated that long-term endemic transmission of VEEV Occurred among villages with seroprevalence levels of 18% to 75% and that medical personnel had a high risk for VEEV exposure. Seroprevalence in wild animals suggested cotton rats as possible reservoir hosts in the region. Virus isolations from sentinel animals and genetic characterizations of these strains indicated continuing circulation of a subtype IE genotype, which was isolated from equines during the recent VEE outbreaks. These data indicate long-term enzootic and endemic VEEV circulation in the region and continued risk for disease in equines and humans.

We experimentally exposed 24 juvenile alligators to WNV parenterally or orally. All became infected, and all but three sustained viremia titers >5.0 log(10) PFU/mL (a threshold considered infectious for Culex quinquetasciatus mosquitoes) for 1 to 8 days. Noninoculated tankmates also became infected. The viremia profiles and multiple routes of infection suggest alligators may play an important role in WNV transmission in areas with high population densities of juvenile alligators.

TI H3N2 influenza virus transmission from swine to turkeys, United States
AB In 1998, a novel H3N2 reassortant virus emerged in the United States swine population. We report the interspecies transmission of this virus to turkeys in two geographically distant farms in the United States in 2003. This event is of concern, considering the reassortment capacity of this virus and the susceptibility of turkey to infection by avian influenza viruses. Two H3N2 isolates, A/turkey/ NC/16108/03 and A/turkey/MN/764/03, had 98.0% to 99.9% nucleotide sequence identity to each other in all eight gene segments. All protein components of the turkey isolates had 97% to 98% sequence identity to swine H3N2 viruses, thus demonstrating interspecies transmission from pigs to turkeys. The turkey isolates were better adapted to avian hosts than were their closest swine counterparts, which suggests that the viruses had already begun to evolve in the new host. The isolation of swine-like H3N2 influenza viruses from turkeys raises new concerns for the cieneration of novel viruses that could affect humans.

TI Experimental everglades virus infection of cotton rats (Sigmodon
   hispidus)
AB Everglades virus (EVEV), an alphavirus in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) serocomplex, circulates among rodents and vector mosquitoes and infects humans, causing a febrile disease sometimes accompanied by neurologic manifestations. EVEV circulates near metropolitan Miami, which indicates the potential for substantial human disease, should outbreaks arise. We characterized EVEV infection of cotton rats in South Florida, USA to validate their role in enzootic transmission. To evaluate whether the viremia induced in cotton rat populations regulates EVEV distribution, we also infected rats from a non-EVEV-endemic area. Viremia levels developed in rats from both localities that exceeded the threshold for infection of the vector. Most animals survived infection with no signs of illness, despite virus invasion of the brain and the development of mild encephalitis. Understanding the mechanisms by which EVEV-infected cotton rats resist clinical disease may be useful in developing VEE therapeutics for equines and humans.

TI Declining hepatitis A seroprevalence: a global review and analysis
AB Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is spread by faecal-oral contact or ingestion of contaminated food or water. Lifelong immunity is conferred by infection or vaccination, so anti-HAV seroprevalence studies can be used to indicate which populations are susceptible to infection. Seroprevalence rates are highly correlated with socioeconomic status and access to clean water and sanitation. Increasing household income, education, water quality and quantity, sanitation, and hygiene leads to decreases in HAV prevalence. Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, and most European nations have low anti-HAV rates. Although anti-HAV rates remain high in most Latin American, Asian, and Middle Eastern nations, average seroprevalence rates are declining. Surveys from Africa generally indicate no significant decline in anti-HAV rates. Because the severity of illness increases with age, populations with a high proportion of susceptible adults should consider targeted vaccination programmes.

TI Estimating transmission parameters of F4+ E-coli for
   F4-receptor-positive and -negative piglets: one-to-one transmission
   experiment
AB F4+ Escherichia coli is an important agent of post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets. Piglets that express an adhesion site for F4+ E. coli in their small intestine (F4R+) shed higher numbers of F4+ E. coli than piglets lacking this site (F4R-). We hypothesized that F4R+ piglets are more infectious and more susceptible for F4+ E. coli. This implies that in populations with F4R+ and F4R- piglets, the transmission would be dependent on the frequency of both types of animals. To quantify the difference in infectiousness and susceptibility, a one-to-one transmission experiment was performed with 20 pairs consisting of one inoculated and one contact piglet. Based on the contact infections observed, transmission parameters were estimated with generalized linear models. F4R+ piglets were infectious for other piglets and the reproduction ratio (R-0) for homogeneous F4R+ populations, that is the average number of secondary infections that one F4R+ pig will cause during its entire infectious period in a population of susceptible F4R+ individuals only, was estimated as 7(.)1. F4R+ piglets were more susceptible than F4R- piglets and reducing the fraction of F4R+ piglets of a population will reduce transmission. It was calculated that in order to prevent major outbreaks of F4+ E. coli (R-0 < 1), the fraction of F4R+ piglets must be lower than 0(.)14.

AB A serological prevalence survey was carried out in Luxembourg during 2000-2001 to determine the antibody status of the Luxembourg population against vaccine-preventable infections including varicella-zoster virus (VZV). ELISA tests performed on 2679 sera indicated that 96 (3(.)6%) of the study population were seronegative. Age-specific seroprevalence rose rapidly from approximately 70% at age 4 years to 90% at age 6 years to 95% at age 12 years. Significant heterogeneity of seroprevalence was observed between the six different primary schools. For age groups 0-5, 6-11 and 12+ years, we estimated an annual force of infection of 0(.)361 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0(.)31-0(.)415)], 0(.)204 (95% CI 0(.)12-0(.)29) and 0(.)05 (95% CI 0(.)024-0(.)082) respectively. Our results indicate that transmission of VZV is highest in children below the age of 6 years and that much lower levels of VZV transmission occur in secondary schools and throughout adulthood.

Mating system of snails from eight populations differing in the amount of genetic variability was manipulated, and self- and cross-fertilized offspring were exposed to naturally occurring trematode parasites in a controlled lake experiment. Susceptibility of snails varied between populations, but mating-system treatment did not have a significant effect. Heterozygosity of snails was negatively correlated with the probability of trematode infection, however, suggesting that parasitic diseases may pose a serious threat to populations lacking genetic variability.

   to primary infection
AB Oral exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 results in systemic infection, but many details surrounding virus transmission remain unresolved. We developed a mucosal model, using human palatine tonsil with intact external epithelium, to study events after oral exposure to HIV. When applied to the external epithelium, semen from an HIV-seropositive patient and cell-free virus both established HIV infection in individual tonsillar cells. However, clusters of infected tonsillar cells were detected where the epithelial surface was damaged. Investigation of the initial events in HIV transmission revealed extensive and stable binding of HIV virions and seminal cells to tonsil epithelium. In experiments modeling physiologically relevant events, the addition of seminal plasma resulted in enhanced virion binding to epithelial cells. These results indicate that, although extensive binding of HIV virions and seminal cells can be demonstrated at an exposed mucosal surface, there is only limited progression from binding to primary infection.

TI Human cytomegalovirus: clinical aspects, immune regulation, and emerging
   treatments
AB After initial infection, human cytomegalovirus remains in a persistent state with the host. Immunity against the virus controls replication, although intermitent viral shedding can still take place in the seropositive immunocompetent person. Replication of cytomegalovirus in the absence of an effective immune response is central to the pathogenesis of disease. Therefore, complications are primarily seen in individuals whose immune system is immature, or is suppressed by drug treatment or coinfection with other pathogens. Although our increasing knowledge of the host-virus relationship has lead to the development of new pharmacological strategies for cytomegalovirus-associated infections, these strategies all have limitations-eg, drug toxicities, development of resistance, poor oral bioavailability, and low potency. Immune-based therapies to complement pharmacological strategies for the successful treatment of virus-associated complications should be prospectively investigated.

TI Human genetics of intracellular infectious diseases: molecular and
   cellular immunity against mycobacteria and salmonellae
AB The ability to develop adequate immunity to intracellular bacterial pathogens is unequally distributed among human beings. In the case of tuberculosis, for example, infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis results in disease in 5-10% of exposed individuals, whereas the remainder control infection effectively. Similar interindividual differences in disease susceptibility are characteristic features of leprosy, typhoid fever, leishmaniasis, and other chronic infectious diseases, including viral infections. The outcome of infection is influenced by many factors, such as nutritional status, co-infections, exposure to environmental microbes, and previous vaccinations. It is clear, however, that genetic host factors also play an important part in controlling disease susceptibility to intracellular pathogens. Recently, patients with severe infections due to otherwise poorly pathogenic mycobacteria (non-tuberculous mycobacteria or Mycobacterium bovis BCG) or Salmonella spp have been identified. Many of these patients were unable to produce or respond to interferon gamma, due to deleterious mutations in genes that encode major proteins in the type 1 cytokine (interleukin 12/interleukin 23/interferon gamma) axis (interleukin 12p40/interleukin 23p40, IL12 receptor beta1/IL23 receptor beta1, interferon gamma receptors 1 and 2, or signal transducer and activator of transcription 1). This axis is a major immunoregulatory system that bridges innate and adaptive immunity. Unusual mycobacterial infections were also reported in several patients with genetic defects in inhibitor of NFkappaB kinase gamma, a key regulatory molecule in the nuclear factor kappaB pathway. New findings discussed in this review provide further and sometimes surprising insights into the role of type 1 cytokines, and into the unexpected heterogeneity seen in these syndromes.

TI Epidemiology of West Nile virus in Connecticut: A five-year analysis of
   mosquito data 1999-2003
AB Two hundred and ten isolations of West Nile virus (WNV) were obtained from 17 mosquito species in six genera in statewide surveillance conducted in Connecticut from June through October, 1999-2003. Culex pipiens (86), Culex salinarius (32), Culex restuans (26), Culiseta melanura (32), and Aedes vexans (12) were implicated as the most likely vectors of WNV in the region based on virus isolation data. Culex pipiens was abundant from July through September and is likely involved in early season enzootic transmission and late season epizootic amplification of the virus in wild bird populations. Epidemic transmission of WNV to humans in urban locales is probable. The abundance of Cx. restuans in June and July and isolations of WNV in early July suggest that this species may play an important role as an enzootic vector involved in early amplification of WNV virus among wild birds. its involvement as a bridge vector to humans is unlikely. Culex salinarius was the most frequently captured Culex species and was abundant in August and September when virus activity was at its height. Frequent isolations of WNV from this species in September when the majority of human cases were reported in union with its abundance at this time of the year, demonstrated vector competence, and broad feeding habits, make Cx. salinarius a likely bridge vector to humans, horses and other mammals. Multiple isolations WNV from Cs. melanura collected in more rural locales in late August and September, provide supportive evidence to suggest that this predominant avian feeder may play a significant role in epizootic amplification of the virus among wild bird populations in these environs. Aedes vexans was the only species of Aedes or Ochlerotatus from which multiple isolations of WNV were made in more than one year and was among the most frequently trapped and abundant species throughout the season. Since Ae. vexans predominately feeds on mammals it is unlikely to play a significant role in epizootic amplification of WNV, however, because of its abundance and aggressive mammalian and human biting behavior it must receive strong consideration as a bridge vector to humans and horses. The occasional virus isolations obtained from Aedes cinereus (4), Uranotaenia sapphirina (3), Ochlerotatus canadensis (2), Ochlerotatus trivittatus (2), Ochlerotatus sollicitans (2), Ochlerotatus sticticus (2), Psorophora ferox (2), Anopheles punctipennis, Anopheles walkeri, Ochlerotatus cantator, Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus, and Ochlerotatus triseriatus in conjunction with their inefficient vector competency and host feeding preferences indicate that these species likely play a very minor role in either the enzootic maintenance or epizootic transmission of WNV in this region. The principal foci of WNV activity in Connecticut were identified as densely populated (>3,000 people/mi(2)) residential communities in coastal Fairfield and New Haven Counties, and in the case of 2002, similar locales in proximity of the city of Hartford in central Hartford County. In almost all instances we observed a correlation both temporally and spatially between the isolation of WNV from field-collected mosquitoes and subsequent human cases in these locales. In most years the incidence of human cases closely paralleled the number of virus isolations made from mosquitoes with both peaks falling in early September.
   We conclude that the isolation of WNV from field-collected mosquitoes is a sensitive indicator of virus activity that is associated with the risk of human infection that habitually extends from early August through the end of October in Connecticut.

TI The impact of cross-immunity, mutation and stochastic extinction on
   pathogen diversity
AB We examine the dynamics of antigenically diverse infectious agents using a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics of arbitrary numbers of pathogen strains, interacting via cross-immunity, and in the presence of mutations generating new strains and stochastic extinctions of existing ones. Equilibrium dynamics fall into three classes depending on cross-immunity, transmissibility and host population size: systems where global extinction is likely, stable single-strain persistence, and multiple-strain persistence with stable diversity. Where multi-strain dynamics are stable, a diversity threshold region separates a low-prevalence, low-diversity region of parameter space from a high-diversity, high-prevalence region. The location of the threshold region is determined by the reproduction number of the pathogen and the intensity of crossimmunity, with the sharpness of the transition being determined by the manner in which immunity accrues with repeated infections. Host population size and cross-immunity are found to be the most decisive factors in deter-mining pathogen diversity. While the model framework developed is simplified, we show that it can capture essential aspects of the complex evolutionary dynamics of pathogens such as influenza.

TI Parasite-mediated reduction in fecundity of mountain hares
AB Mountain hare populations in Scotland exhibit regular 10 year fluctuations in abundance. Simple models of host-parasite population dynamics suggest that parasite-mediated reductions in host fecundity can cause a transition from stable to cyclic host population dynamics. We tested the hypothesis that parasites reduce hare fecundity by experimentally reducing parasite burdens and recording female survival, body condition and fecundity. We captured 41 adult female hares in October 2002; 22 were treated with Ivermectin to remove parasites and 19 were left untreated as controls. The treated and untreated hares were culled in May 2003 together with a second control group of nine unhandled hares. Treatment with Ivermectin significantly reduced the abundance of Trichostrongylus retortaeformis and increased the fecundity of the hares, but had no measurable effect on body condition or over-winter survival. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that parasites may be a contributory cause of cycles in populations of mountain hares.

TI A parasite reveals cryptic phylogeographic history of its host
AB This study compares the continental phylogeographic patterns of two wild European species linked by a host-parasite relationship: the field mouse Apodemus sylvaticus and one of its specific parasites, the nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus. A total of 740 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene were sequenced in 122 specimens of H.polygyrus and compared with 94 cyt b gene sequences (974bp) previously acquired for A. sylvaticus. The results reveal partial spatial and temporal congruences in the differentiation of both species' lineages: the parasite and its host present three similar genetic and geographical lineages, i.e. Western European, Italian and Sicilian, and both species recolonized northwestern Europe from the Iberian refuge at the end of the Pleistocene. However, H. polygyrus presents three particular differentiation events. The relative rate of molecular evolution of the cyt b gene was estimated to be 1.5-fold higher in the parasite than in its host. Therefore, the use of H. polygyrus as a biological magnifying glass is discussed as this parasite may highlight previously undetected historical events of its host. The results show how incorporating phylogeographic information of an obligate associate can help to better understand the phylogeographic pattern of its host.

TI The role of disease transmission and conferred immunity in outbreaks:
   Analysis of the 1993 Cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
AB The authors examined two competing hypotheses regarding the cause of the 1993. Cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The first was that oocyst contamination of the drinking-water influent, coupled with a treatment plant failure, resulted in a point-source outbreak. The second was that the outbreak was the result of transmission processes that amplified the oocyst concentration in the drinking-water effluent. Analysis of the model suggested that 1) transmission directly from person to person contributed 10% (95% confidence interval: 6%, 21 %) of the total cases; 2) closing the drinking-water plant prevented 19% (95% confidence interval: 17%, 21 %) of the additional cases of disease that occurred compared with the scenario in which the plant had not been closed, a result primarily driven by conferred immunity that resulted in depletion of the susceptible population; and 3) the outbreak was caused by a transmission cycle due to infectious persons shedding pathogens into the sewage, environmental transport of these pathogens via Lake Michigan to the drinking-water plant, and infection of susceptible persons via exposure to drinking water. The incidence data were consistent with this hypothesis. Further simulations suggested, that increasing the distance between the wastewater effluent and the drinking-water influent may have prevented the outbreak.

TI Should models of disease dynamics in herbivorous insects include the
   effects of variability in host-plant foliage quality?
AB Interactions between insects and their baculovirus pathogens are often described using simple disease models. Baculoviruses, however, are transmitted when insects consume virus-contaminated foliage, and foliage variability, whether within or between host-plant species, can affect viral infectiousness. Insect-baculovirus interactions may thus be embedded in a tritrophic interaction with the insect's host plant, but disease models include only the host and the pathogen. We tested these models by measuring the transmission of a baculovirus of gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar) on red oak (Quercus rubra) and white oak (Quercus alba) in the field in six experiments over four years. In all experiments, there were only weak effects of host-tree species, and in only one did the best-fitting model include tree species effects. These weak effects of foliage variability on transmission were not due to a lack of foliage variability on viral infectiousness, because when larvae were force-fed virus-contaminated foliage, infection rates were higher on white oak. Our results suggest that feeding behavior plays an important role in baculovirus transmission and that models can usefully describe baculovirus dynamics even without including foliage variability. Our work provides a clear example of how two-species models are sometimes sufficient to describe what appear to be tritrophic interactions.

TI Selective predation and productivity jointly drive complex behavior in
   host-parasite systems
AB Successful invasion of a parasite into a host population and resulting host-parasite dynamics can depend crucially on other members of a host's community such as predators. We do not fully understand how predation intensity and selectivity shape host-parasite dynamics because the interplay between predator density, predator foraging behavior, and ecosystem productivity remains incompletely explored. By modifying a standard susceptible-infected model, we show how productivity can modulate complex behavior induced by saturating and selective foraging behavior of predators in an otherwise stable host-parasite system. When predators strongly prefer parasitized hosts, the host-parasite system can oscillate, but predators can also create alternative stable states, Allee effects, and catastrophic extinction of parasites. In the latter three cases, parasites have difficulty invading and/or persisting in ecosystems. When predators are intermediately selective, these more complex behaviors become less important, but the host-parasite system can switch from stable to oscillating and then back to stable states along a gradient of predator control. Surprisingly, at higher productivity, predators that neutrally select or avoid parasitized hosts can catalyze extinction of both hosts and parasites. Thus, synergy between two enemies can end disastrously for the host. Such diverse outcomes underscore the crucial importance of the community and ecosystem context in which host-parasite interactions occur.

TI Mechanisms of disease-induced extinction
AB Parasites are important determinants of ecological dynamics. Despite the widespread perception that parasites (in the broad sense, including microbial pathogens) threaten species with extinction, the simplest deterministic models of parasite dynamics (i.e. of specialist parasites with density-dependent transmission) predict that parasites will always go extinct before their hosts. We review the primary theoretical mechanisms that allow disease-induced extinction and compare them with the empirical literature on parasitic threats to populations to assess the importance of different mechanisms in threatening natural populations. Small pre-epidemic population size and the presence of reservoirs are the most commonly cited factors for disease-induced extinction in empirical studies.

The average yearly reported incidence was 2.4 per 100,000 persons, with a 14% death rate. Among clinical manifestations, incidence of pneumonia increased from 0.06 per 100,000 in 1995 to 0.50 per 100,000 in 2000. Over a span of 7 years, the odds of developing pneumonia increased (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.5), while they decreased for soft-tissue infections (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.7-1.0). Serotypes M1 and M3 accounted for 30% of IGASI. However, neither serotype was significantly associated with specific clinical manifestations, which suggests that manifestation development among IGASI might be attributable to host or environmental factors rather than the pathogen. In our study, these factors included age, gender, underlying medical conditions, and living environment, yet none explained temporal changes in risk for pneumonia and soft-tissue infections.

TI Spatial and temporal patterns of parthenogenesis and parasitism in the
   freshwater snail Melanoides tuberculata
AB The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sex should be more common in populations heavily infested with parasites, than in those without. This hypothesis was investigated in the aquatic snail Melanoides tuberculata, in which both sexual and parthenogenetic individuals exist in natural populations, and some populations are heavily infested by trematodes. The presence of fertile males and the higher genetic diversity of bisexual populations are indicative of sexual reproduction. We compared sites in 1990, 1999, and 2001, and we looked for a positive correlation between male and parasite frequencies. Male frequency was not correlated with the frequency of individuals infected by trematodes. This lack of correlation was reconfirmed in a retrospective power analysis. In a period of 9 years, male frequencies decreased but infection levels increased. These results do not support the Red Queen hypothesis. In samples with high male frequency the number of embryos was low, perhaps indicating that males may have a negative effect on embryo numbers. This effect of males on fitness could perhaps suggest that the cost of sex is fewer embryos. The reduction in embryo numbers may also represent a trade-off between mating and egg production costs.

   Microbotryum violaceum in sympatric, parapatric and allopatric
   populations of two host species Silene latifolia and S-dioica
AB We investigated genetic diversity in West European populations of the fungal pathogen Microbotryum violaceum in sympatric, parapatric and allopatric populations of the host species Silene latifolia and S. dioica, using four polymorphic microsatellite loci. In allopatric host populations, the fungus was highly differentiated by host species, exhibiting high values of F-ST and R-ST, and revealed clear and distinct host races. In sympatric and parapatric populations we found significant population differentiation as well, except for one sympatric population in which the two host species grew truly intermingled. The mean number of alleles per locus for isolates from each of the host species was significantly higher in sympatric/parapatric than in allopatric populations. This suggests that either gene flow between host races in sympatry, or in case of less neutral loci, selection in a more heterogeneous host environment can increase the level of genetic variation in each of the demes. The observed pattern of host-related genetic differentiation among these geographically spread populations suggest a long-term divergence between these host races. In sympatric host populations, both host races presumably come in secondary contact, and host-specific alleles are exchanged depending on the amount of fungal gene flow.

TI The molecular population genetics of the Tomato spotted wilt virus
   (TSWV) genome
AB RNA viruses are characterized by high genetic variability resulting in rapid adaptation to new or resistant hosts. Research for plant RNA virus genetic structure and its variability has been relatively scarce compared to abundant research done for human and animal RNA viruses. Here, we utilized a molecular population genetic framework to characterize the evolution of a highly pathogenic plant RNA virus [Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Tospovirus, Bunyaviridae]. Data from genes encoding five viral proteins were used for phylogenetic analysis, and for estimation of population parameters, subpopulation differentiation, recombination, divergence between Tospovirus species, and selective constraints on the TSWV genome. Our analysis has defined the geographical structure of TSWV, attributed possibly to founder effects. Also, we identify positive selection favouring divergence between Tospovirus species. At the species level, purifying selection has acted to preserve protein function, although certain amino acids appear to be under positive selection. This analysis provides demonstration of population structuring and species-wide population expansions in a multisegmented plant RNA virus, using sequence-based molecular population genetic analyses. It also identifies specific amino acid sites subject to selection within Bunyaviridae and estimates the level of genetic heterogeneity of a highly pathogenic plant RNA virus. The study of the variability of TSWV populations lays the foundation in the development of strategies for the control of other viral diseases in floral crops.

TI On the ubiquity and phylogeny of Wolbachia in lice
AB Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria that occur in an estimated 20% of arthropod species. They are of broad interest because they profoundly affect the reproductive fitness of diverse host taxa. Here we document the apparent ubiquity and diversity of Wolbachia in the insect orders Anoplura (sucking lice) and Mallophaga (chewing lice), by detecting single or multiple infections in each of 25 tested populations of lice, representing 19 species from 15 genera spanning eight taxonomic families. Phylogenetic analyses indicate a high diversity of Wolbachia in lice, as evidenced by the identification of 39 unique strains. Some of these strains are apparently unique to lice, whereas others are similar to strains that infect other insect taxa. Wolbachia are transmitted from infected females to their offspring via egg cyto-plasm, such that similar species of lice are predicted to have similar strains of Wolbachia. This predicted pattern is not supported in the current study and may reflect multiple events of recent horizontal transmission between host species. At present, there is no known mechanism that would allow for this latter mode of transmission to and within species of lice.

TI Group-beneficial traits, frequency-dependent selection and genotypic
   diversity: an antibiotic resistance paradigm
AB The evolution of group-beneficial traits potentially allows the survival of 'cheaters' that would otherwise be unfit. Here we describe experimental work on group-beneficial traits and the consequences of frequency-dependent selection in the context of bacterial antibiotic resistance. We constructed a 'self-limited antibiotic resistant' (SLAR) strain of Escherichia coli in which a TEM-1 P-lactamase was anchored to the inner membrane. In pairwise competition experiments between the SLAR strain and ampicillin-sensitive strains, only the SLAR strain survived in the presence of ampicillin. We also constructed a 'shared antibiotic resistant' (SAR) strain in which TEM-1 beta-lactamase protected both the SAR strain and nearby sensitive cells, thus acting as a model for a genetically defined group-beneficial trait. In pairwise competition experiments of the SAR strain against two different sensitive strains of E. coli, we found that the sensitive strains maintained themselves at frequencies of 5-12% in the presence of ampicillin. When the relative cost of the SAR strain was lowered, its equilibrial frequency rose. Sensitive strains also arose from pure cultures of the SAR strain. In these cases, too, the sensitive 'cheaters' were maintained in ampicillin at frequencies comparable to those observed in the previous competitions. These results suggest that traits which benefit other group members can permit survival of genotypes that otherwise would be eliminated by natural selection, and allow the maintenance of greater genetic variation upon which evolution can operate.

   immunodeficiency virus: Strategy to study HIV preclinical interventions
   in nonhuman primates
AB A nonhuman-primate model of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection that more closely emulates human heterosexual transmission by use of multiple exposures to low doses of virus is critical to better evaluate intervention strategies that include microbicides or vaccines. In this report, we describe such a system that uses female pig-tailed macaques exposed vaginally to a CCR5-using simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIVSF162P3) at weekly intervals. Results of dose-titration experiments indicated that 3 once-weekly exposures to 10 tissue culture infectious doses of SHIVSF162P3 resulted in consistent transmission of virus and establishment of systemic infection. The efficacy of cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) as a vaginal microbicide was evaluated by applying it to the vaginal vault of macaques (n = 4) 15 min before each weekly exposure to SHIVSF162P3. One conclusion that can be drawn from the data derived from multiple exposures to virus is that CAP prevented infection in 12 of 13 possible chances for infection, over the course of 39 total exposures. Our findings provide a basis to refine monkey models for transmission of HIV-1, which may be relevant to preclinical evaluation for therapeutic interventions.

TI Seasonal variation of Tungiasis in an endemic community
AB Tungiasis (caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans) is hyperendemic in many resource-poor communities in Brazil. To understand transmission dynamics of this parasitic skin disease in a typical endemic area, a longitudinal study was carried out in a slum in Fortaleza in northeastern Brazil. In a door-to-door survey, the population of a randomly selected area (n = 1,460) was examined on four occasions for the presence of embedded sand fleas. Prevalence rates were 33.6% in March (rainy season), 23.8% in June (end of the rainy season), 54.4% in September (peak of the dry season), and 16.8% in January (begin of the rainy season). Tungiasis was more common in males than in females. The intensity of infestation was correlated with the prevalence. The study shows that prevalence of tungiasis and parasite burden vary significantly during the year with a peak in the dry season. These findings have important consequences for the design of control measures.

AB Spatial patterns of and risk factors for seropositivity of dengue infection were studied in three sites in northern Thailand. A survey was conducted in 2001 among 1,750 persons. Potential risk factors for dengue infection were measured by questionnaire and IgM antibodies against dengue were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The role of landscape as a risk factor was studied using land cover maps and a geographic information system. Logistic regression identified risk factors for dengue seropositivity. Spatial patterns of seropositive cases were determined by cluster analyses. Six percent of the study population was seropositive. Risk factors for dengue seropositivity differed per site. demonstrating variation in local infection patterns. In the periurban site, seropositivity depended on human behavior and factors related to housing quality rather than environmental factors. In both rural sites, older persons had a higher risk of seropositivity and persons living in houses surrounded by natural and agricultural land covers had a lower risk of seropositivity.

   communities
AB Knowledge of mosquito dispersal is critical for vector-borne disease control and prevention strategies and for understanding population structure and pathogen dissemination. We determined Aedes aegypti flight range and dispersal patterns from 21 mark-release-recapture experiments conducted over 11 years (1991-2002) in Puerto Rico and Thailand. Dispersal was compared by release location, sex, age, season, and village. For all experiments, the majority of mosquitoes were collected from their release house or adjacent house. Inter-village movement was detected rarely, with a few mosquitoes moving a maximum of 512 meters from one Thai village to the next. Average dispersal distances were similar for males and females and females released indoors versus outdoors. The movement of Ae. aegypti was not influenced by season or age, but differed by village. Results demonstrate that adult Ae. aegypti disperse relatively short distances. suggesting that people rather than mosquitoes are the primary mode of dengue virus dissemination within and among communities.

TI Effects of human exclusion on parasitism in intertidal food webs of
   central Chile
AB Numerous ecological studies have demonstrated the dramatic effects that humans have on coastal marine ecosystems. Consequently, marine reserves have been established to preserve biodiversity. Recent reviews show that this strategy has paid off because inside reserves, most species have rapidly increased in size and abundance. Even though these studies focused on free-living organisms and paid little attention to parasite populations, numerous authors support the hypothesis that parasitism levels could be good indicators of ecosystem stability. We examined harvesting effects on the dynamics of a parasitic trematode (Proctoeces lintoni) that completes its life cycle in intertidal mussels (Perumytilus purpuratus), keyhole limpets (Fissurella crassa), and clingfish ( Sicyases sanguineus). All of these species are directly or indirectly affected by humans. Prevalence and abundance of the trematode P. lintoni in the three host species were compared in four study sites that differed in the intensity of human harvest. Parasitism infection in limpets and mussels was significantly higher in areas protected from human harvesting than in open-access areas, which suggests a significant change in parasite dynamics inside reserves. Yet the average parasitic biomass found in the gonads of F. crassa did not differ between protected and open-access areas. These results show, then, that the parasite system responded by increasing infection rates in marine protected areas without implication for reproductive success of the intermediate host. Our findings show that the indirect effects of harvesting by humans on the embedded parasite communities of littoral ecosystems require further scientific investigation.

TI Managing febrile respiratory illnesses during a hypothetical SARS
   outbreak
AB Since the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) contained in July 2003, new cases have periodically reemerged in Asia. This situation has placed hospitals and health officials worldwide on heightened alert. In a future outbreak, rapidly and accurately distinguishing SARS from other common febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) could be difficult. We constructed a decision-analysis model to identify the most efficient strategies for managing undifferentiated FRIs within a hypothetical SARS outbreak in New York City during the season of respiratory infections. If establishing reliable epidemiologic links were not possible, societal costs would exceed $2.0 billion per month. SARS testing with existing polymerase chain reaction assays would have harmful public health and economic consequences if SARS made up <0.1% of circulating FRIs. Increasing influenza vaccination rates among the general population before the onset of respiratory season would save both money and lives.

TI Dispersal in a parasitic worm and its two hosts: Consequence for local
   adaptation
AB Characterizing host and parasite population genetic structure and estimating gene flow among populations is essential for understanding coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites. We examined the population genetic structure of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and its two host species (the definitive host Rattus rattus and the intermediate host Biomphalaria glabrata) using microsatellite markers. Parasites were sampled from rats. The study was conducted in five sites of the Guadeloupe Island, Lesser Antilles. Mollusks display a pattern of isolation by distance whereas such a pattern is not found neither in schistosomes nor in rats. The comparison of the distribution of genetic variability in S. mansoni and its two host species strongly suggests that migration of parasites is principally determined by that of the vertebrate host in the marshy focus of Guadeloupe. However, the comparison between genetic differentiation values in schistosomes and rats suggests that the efficacy of the schistosome rat-mediated dispersal between transmission sites is lower than expected given the prevalence, parasitic load and migration rate of rats among sites. This could notably suggest that rat migration rate could be negatively correlated to the age or the infection status of individuals. Models made about the evolution of local adaptation in function of the dispersal rates of hosts and parasites suggest that rats and mollusks should be locally adapted to their parasites.

TI Contribution of HIV-1 infection to acquisition of sexually transmitted
   disease: A 10-year prospective study
AB Background. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) enhance human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 susceptibility, but few studies have examined the reciprocal effect of HIV-1 on STD acquisition.
   Methods. Data from a prospective cohort study conducted among female sex workers in Mombasa, Kenya between 1993 and 2003 were used to determine the effect of HIV-1 infection on STD susceptibility. The cohort included 1215 HIV-1-seronegative women who underwent monthly HIV-1 and STD screening, of whom 238 experienced seroconversion to HIV-1 during follow-up. Andersen-Gill proportional-hazards models were used to compare the incidence rates for genital-tract infections (syphilis, genital ulcer disease [GUD], Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, Chlamydia trachomatis infection, Trichomonas vaginalis infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis) in HIV-1-seropositive versus HIV-1-seronegative women, after controlling for sexual behavior and other potential confounding factors.
   Results. HIV-1 infection was associated with a significantly higher incidence of GUD (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-3.9), gonorrhea (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2), and vulvovaginal candidiasis (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.8). The risks of GUD and vulvovaginal candidiasis increased with progressive levels of immunosuppression.
   Conclusions. The increased incidence of genital-tract infections among HIV-1-seropositive women could promote the spread of both HIV-1 and other STDs, particularly in areas where these conditions are highly prevalent.

TI Social context, sexual networks, and racial disparities in rates of
   sexually transmitted infections
AB Background. Social context ( demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and sociopolitical features of the environment) influences the epidemiology and consequences of individual behaviors that affect health outcomes. This article examines the role of social context in heterosexual networks that facilitate the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), particularly in relation to persistent racial disparities in rates of STIs in the United States.
   Methods. Review of the medical, public health, and social science literature.
   Results. Contextual factors, such as poverty, discrimination, epidemiology of illicit drug use in the community, ratio of men to women, incarceration rates, and racial segregation, influence sexual behavior and sexual networks directly and indirectly through a variety of mechanisms. Disparities in these contextual features likely contribute substantially to the persistence of marked racial disparities in rates of STIs.
   Conclusions. Given the importance of contextual factors and the sharply contrasting social contexts for blacks and whites, exclusive emphasis on individual risk factors and determinants is unlikely to produce solutions that will significantly decrease HIV rates among blacks. Effective HIV prevention in this population will require multidisciplinary research to address the contextual factors that promote patterns of sexual networks that facilitate transmission of STIs.

AB Biological strategies for interrupting transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 should be directed at reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1. Potential antiretroviral interventions include reducing the likelihood of transmission of HIV-1 by reducing HIV-1 load in the blood and genital tract of HIV-1-infected person, prophylaxis after high-risk exposure, and pre-exposure prophylaxis for very high risk populations. Antiviral treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2, the most common cause of genital ulcers, should be evaluated as a strategy for HIV-1 infection prevention by reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1, on the basis of biological and epidemiological data indicating that HSV-2 facilitates transmission and acquisition of HIV-1. The rationale for antiretroviral and HSV-2-specific interventions and studies to test these strategies are described.

Little is known about how patterns of contact between SWs and their clients influence the persistence of STIs. We developed an individual-based simulation model to explore how variation in number of client contacts per SW, whether clients repeatedly visited the same SW, and the relative sizes of the SW and client populations influence the endemic prevalence of gonorrhea and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection. Persistence of either infection was more likely if clients visited many different SWs, regardless of variation in the SW-client contact rate, and also resulted in a higher endemic prevalence in both populations and a greater likelihood of persistence of infection at lower levels in the general population. The size of the SW population (relative to the total population) was found to be most important in determining the overall prevalence of infection.

TI Sexual role and transmission of HIV type 1 among men who have sex with
   men, in Peru
AB In Latin America, men who have sex with men (MSM) have traditionally practiced role segregation-that is, the adoption of a fixed role (insertive or receptive) rather than a versatile role ( both practices) during anal sex. Previous modeling has shown that role segregation may yield a lower incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection, compared with role versatility; however, the modeling assumed no risk of acquiring HIV-1 during insertive sex, which is now recognized as unlikely. We reexamine the issue by use of a deterministic model incorporating bidirectional transmission and data from a cohort study of MSM in Lima, Peru, to demonstrate the potential effects of role segregation on the trajectory of the HIV-1 epidemic. In Lima, 67% of MSM reported segregated roles in their recent male partnerships. A population of MSM with identical contact rates but complete role versatility would have twice the prevalence of HIV-1 infection throughout the epidemic's first 3 decades. Preferential mixing among versatile MSM does not change overall prevalence but affects which individuals become infected.

TI Determinants of the impact of sexually transmitted infection treatment
   on prevention of HIV infection: A synthesis of evidence from the Mwanza,
   Rakai, and Masaka intervention trials
AB Community-randomized trials in Mwanza, Tanzania, and Rakai and Masaka, Uganda, suggested that population characteristics were an important determinant of the impact of sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment interventions on incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We performed simulation modeling of HIV and STI transmission, which confirmed that the low trial impact in Rakai and Masaka could be explained by low prevalences of curable STI resulting from lower-risk sexual behavior in Uganda. The mature HIV epidemics in Uganda, with most HIV transmission occurring outside core groups with high STI rates, also contributed to the low impact on HIV incidence. Simulated impact on HIV was much greater in Mwanza, although the observed impact was larger than predicted from STI reductions, suggesting that random error also may have played some role. Of proposed alternative explanations, increasing herpetic ulceration due to HIV-related immunosuppression contributed little to the diminishing impact of antibiotic treatment during the Ugandan epidemics. The strategy of STI treatment also was unimportant, since syndromic treatment and annual mass treatment showed similar effectiveness in simulations of each trial population. In conclusion, lower-risk behavior and the mature HIV epidemic explain the limited impact of STI treatment on HIV incidence in Uganda in the 1990s. In populations with high-risk sexual behavior and high STI rates, STIs treatment interventions may contribute substantially to prevention of HIV infection.

   What has worked?
AB Background. Previous reviews of interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) focused mostly on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We reviewed trials of interventions to prevent sexual transmission of any STI, employing a multilevel perspective.
   Methods. We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and recent unpublished presentations through 2003, to identify randomized controlled trials of preventive STI interventions having systematic, objective measurement of STI outcomes. We classified trials according to intervention target and level of randomization ( individual, group, or community); impact target ( acquisition, transmission, or complications of STI); and primary intervention modality.
   Results. Of 83 trials identified, 41 met inclusion criteria, including trials of 28 individual-level, 9 group-level, and 4 community-level interventions. Among individual- and group-level interventions, 32 targeted acquisition, 4 targeted transmission, and 1 targeted complications of STI. The 4 intervention modalities most often used included behavior change ( 12 studies), vaccination ( 7 studies), use of topical microbicides ( 10 studies), and prophylactic, curative, or suppressive therapy ( 10 studies). Community-level interventions had multiple impact targets, and 2 interventions used multiple modalities. Only 1 intervention showed efficacy against sexual transmission of HIV, but 22 (53.7%) showed effectiveness against other STIs.
   Conclusion. Although many interventions have been found to be effective against STIs, few have been replicated, widely implemented, or carefully evaluated for effectiveness in other settings.

TI Parasites and mutational load: an experimental test of a pluralistic
   theory for the evolution of sex
AB Ecological and mutational explanations for the evolution of sexual reproduction have usually been considered independently. Although many of these explanations have yielded promising theoretical results, experimental support for their ability to overcome a twofold cost of sex has been limited. For this reason, it has recently been argued that a pluralistic approach, combining effects from multiple models, may be necessary to explain the apparent advantage of sex. One such pluralistic model proposes that parasite load and synergistic epistasis between deleterious mutations might interact to create an advantage for recombination. Here, we test this proposal by comparing the fitness functions of parasitized and parasite-free genotypes of Escherichia coli bearing known numbers of transposon-insertion mutations. In both classes, we failed to detect any evidence for synergistic epistasis. However, the average effect of deleterious mutations was greater in parasitized than parasite-free genotypes. This effect might broaden the conditions under which another proposed model combining parasite-host coevolutionary dynamics and mutation accumulation can explain the maintenance of sex. These results suggest that, on average, deleterious mutations act multiplicatively with each other but in synergy with infection in determining fitness.

TI Strategy for distribution of influenza vaccine to high-risk groups and
   children
AB Despite evidence that vaccinating schoolchildren against influenza is effective in limiting community-level transmission, the United States has had a long-standing government strategy of recommending that vaccine be concentrated primarily in high-risk groups and distributed to those people who keep the health system and social infrastructure operating. Because of this year's influenza vaccine shortage, a plan was enacted to distribute the limited vaccine stock to these groups first. This vaccination strategy, based on direct protection of those most at risk, has not been very effective in reducing influenza morbidity and mortality. Although it is too late to make changes this year, the current influenza vaccine crisis affords the opportunity to examine an alternative for future years. The alternative plan, supported by mathematical models and influenza field studies, would be to concentrate vaccine in schoolchildren, the population group most responsible for transmission, while also covering the reachable high-risk groups, who would also receive considerable indirect protection. In conjunction with a plan to ensure an adequate vaccine supply, this alternative influenza vaccination strategy would help control interpandemic influenza and be instrumental in preparing for pandemic influenza. The effectiveness of the alternative plan could be assessed through nationwide community studies.

TI Female-to-male infectivity of HIV-1 among circumcised and uncircumcised
   Kenyan men
AB Background. A lack of male circumcision has been associated with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition in a number of studies, but questions remain as to whether confounding by behavioral practices explains these results. The objective of the present study was to model per-sex act probabilities of female-to-male HIV-1 transmission (i.e., infectivity) for circumcised and uncircumcised men, by use of detailed accounts of sexual behavior in a population with multiple partnerships.
   Methods. Data were collected as part of a prospective cohort study of HIV-1 acquisition among 745 Kenyan truck drivers. Sexual behavior with wives, casual partners, and prostitutes was recorded at quarterly follow-up visits. Published HIV-1 seroprevalence estimates among Kenyan women were used to model HIV-1 per-sex act transmission probabilities.
   Results. The overall probability of HIV-1 acquisition per sex act was 0.0063 (95% confidence interval, 0.0035-0.0091). Female-to-male infectivity was significantly higher for uncircumcised men than for circumcised men (0.0128 vs. 0.0051; P = .04). The effect of circumcision was robust in subgroup analyses and across a wide range of HIV-1 prevalence estimates for sex partners.
   Conclusions. After accounting for sexual behavior, we found that uncircumcised men were at a >2-fold increased risk of acquiring HIV-1 per sex act, compared with circumcised men. Moreover, female-to-male infectivity of HIV-1 in the context of multiple partnerships may be considerably higher than that estimated from studies of HIV-1-serodiscordant couples. These results may explain the rapid spread of the HIV-1 epidemic in settings, found throughout much of Africa, in which multiple partnerships and a lack of male circumcision are common.

TI Selection for plasmid post-segregational killing depends on multiple
   infection: evidence for the selection of more virulent parasites through
   parasite-level competition
AB Is the virulence of parasites an outcome of optimized infection? Virulence has often been considered an inevitable consequence of parasite reproduction when the cost incurred by the parasite in reducing the fitness of its current host is offset by increased infection of new hosts. More recent models have focused on how competition occurring between parasites during co-infection might effect selection of virulence. For example, if co-infection was common, parasites with higher intrinsic growth rates might be selected, even at the expense of being optimally adapted to infect new hosts. If growth rate is positively correlated with virulence, then competition would select increased virulence. We tested these models using a plasmid-encoded virulence determinant. The virulence determinant did not contribute to the plasmid's reproduction within or between hosts. Despite this, virulent plasmids were more successful than avirulent derivatives during selection in an environment allowing within-host competition. To explain these findings we propose and test a model in which virulent parasites are selected by reducing the reproduction of competitors.

AB Aedes aegypti, the mosquito responsible for transmitting dengue, has colonized many cities and towns throughout Arizona. Determining both the migration between, and the origin of, local Ae. aegypti populations is important for vector control and disease prevention purposes. Amplified fragment length polymorphism was used to infer geographic structure and local substructure, and effective migration rates (M, migrants per generation) between populations, and to determine genetic differentiation between populations Three geographically and genetically differentiated groups of populations were identified. Population substructure was only detected in the border town of Nogales. Reliable estimates of M between regions ranged from 1.02 to 3.41 and between cities within regions from 1.66 to 4.44. In general, pairwise Phi(PT) were lowest between cities within regions. The observed patterns of genetic differentiation suggest infrequent migration between populations and are compatible with the idea of human transport facilitating dispersal between regions.

TI A prescription for longer life? Bot fly parasitism of the white-footed
   mouse
AB Investigation of host-parasite interactions typically reveals a negative impact of parasitism on the host species. In contrast, mounting evidence indicates that bot fly (Cuterebra sp.) infestation enhances the survival of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). We propose that life history trade-offs, namely, between reproduction and survival, can explain this counterintuitive observation. By using an extensive data set spanning a decade, 12 sites in two states, and over 30 000 mouse captures, we offer a new perspective on the effects of hot fly parasitism on white-footed mice. Analysis of persistence time corroborated earlier studies that showed significantly higher survival-rates of infested mice. Although a higher proportion of infested than uninfested females were in breeding condition, secondary reproductive success appeared to be negatively impacted by parasitism via declines in the number of litters and the total number of offspring produced by infested females. Population growth rates were negatively correlated with infestation prevalence, further indicating a negative effect of parasitism. Based on the negative impact of parasitism on reproduction, we propose that enhanced survival of infested mice can be explained by the diversion of resources from reproduction to body maintenance. Parasite-induced life history shifts in which mice decrease current reproduction to promote future reproduction, such as increasing the age at maturity, may also contribute to the decline in population growth rate observed in years of high infestation prevalence.

TI Parasites hinder monarch butterfly flight: implications for disease
   spread in migratory hosts
AB Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are parasitized by the protozoan Ophryocystis elektroscirrha throughout their geographical range. Monarchs inhabiting seasonally fluctuating environments migrate annually, and parasite prevalence is lower among migratory relative to non-migratory populations. One explanation for this pattern is that long-distance migration weeds out infected animals, thus reducing parasite prevalence and transmission between generations. In this study we experimentally infected monarchs from a migratory population and recorded their long-distance flight performance using a tethered flight mill. Results showed that parasitized butterflies exhibited shorter flight distances, slower flight speeds, and lost proportionately more body mass per km flown. Differences between parasitized and unparasitized monarchs were generally not explained by individual variation in wing size, shape, or wing loading, suggesting that poorer flight performance among parasitized hosts was not directly caused by morphological constraints. Effects of parasite infection on powered flight support a role for long-distance migration in dramatically reducing parasite prevalence in this and other host-pathogen systems.

TI Evolution of antibiotic resistance by human and bacterial niche
   construction
AB Antibiotic treatment by humans generates strong viability selection for antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. The frequency of host antibiotic use often determines the strength of this selection, and changing patterns of antibiotic use can generate many types of behaviors in the population dynamics of resistant and sensitive bacterial populations. In this paper, we present a simple model of hosts dimorphic for their tendency to use/avoid antibiotics and bacterial pathogens dimorphic in their resistance/sensitivity to antibiotic treatment. When a constant fraction of hosts uses antibiotics, the two bacterial strain populations can coexist unless host use-frequency is above a critical value; this critical value is derived as the ratio of the fitness cost of resistance to the fitness cost of undergoing treatment. When strain frequencies can affect host behavior, the dynamics may be analyzed in the light of niche construction. We consider three models underlying changing host behavior: conformism, the avoidance of long infections, and adherence to the advice of public health officials. In the latter two, we find that the pathogen can have quite a strong effect on host behavior. In particular, if antibiotic use is discouraged when resistance levels are high, we observe a classic niche-construction phenomenon of maintaining strain polymorphism even in parameter regions where it would not be expected.

However, empirical evidence demonstrating the existence and nature of intraspecific competition is lacking for many parasites. Here, we compared within-host competitiveness between genetic strains of Schistosoma mansoni with high (HIGH-V) or low (LOW-V) virulence to their intermediate snail host, Biomphalaria glabrata. Groups of snails were exposed to either one or the other of two parasite strains, or a mixed infection of both strains, and the resulting progeny were identified using a molecular marker. In two separate experiments investigating simultaneous and sequential infections, we demonstrated that the lifetime reproductive success of parasite strain HIGH-V was reduced in the presence of a faster replicating parasite genotype, LOW-V, regardless of whether it was in a majority or minority in the initial inoculum of the simultaneous exposure or of its relative position in the sequential exposure experiment. Thus, we demonstrate competition between parasite genotypes and asymmetry in competitive Success between parasite strains. Moreover, since the less virulent strain investigated here had a competitive advantage, we suggest that a high frequency of multiple infections could favor the evolution of less, rather than more, virulent parasites in this system.

TI Evolutionary traction: the cost of adaptation and the evolution of sex
AB The advantage of sexual reproduction remains a puzzle for evolutionary biologists. Everything else being equal, asexual populations are expected to have twice the number of offspring produced by similar sexual populations. Yet, asexual species are uncommon among higher eukaryotes. In models assuming small populations, high mutation rates, or frequent environmental changes, sexual reproduction seems to have at least a two-fold advantage over asexuality. But the advantage of sex for large populations, low mutation rates, and rare or mild environmental changes remains a conundrum. Here we show that without recombination, rare advantageous mutations can result in increased accumulation of deleterious mutations ('evolutionary traction'), which explains the long-term advantage of sex under a wide parameter range.

TI HIV and male circumcision - a systematic review with assessment of the
   quality of studies
AB This Cochrane systematic review assesses the evidence for an interventional effect of male circumcision in preventing acquisition of HIV-1 and HIV-2 by men through heterosexual intercourse. The review includes a comprehensive assessment of the quality of all 37 included observational studies. Studies in high-risk populations consisted of four cohort studies, 12 cross-sectional studies, and three case-control studies; general population studies consisted of one cohort study, 16 cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study. There is evidence of methodological heterogeneity between studies, and statistical heterogeneity was highly significant for both general population cross-sectional studies (x(2)=132-34; degrees of freedom [df]=15; p<0.00001) and high-risk cross-sectional studies (x(2)=29-70; df=10; p=0.001). Study quality was very variable and no studies measured the same set of potential confounding variables. Therefore conducting a meta-analysis was inappropriate. Detailed quality assessment of observational studies can provide a useful visual aid to interpreting findings. Although most studies show an association between male circumcision and prevention of HIV, these results may be limited by confounding, which is unlikely to be adjusted for.

TI Phylogeography of a nematode (Heligmosomoides polygyrus) in the western
   Palearctic region: persistence of northern cryptic populations during
   ice ages?
AB This study establishes the continental phylogeographical pattern of a European nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Dujardin, 1845; Heligmosomoidea). We sequenced 687 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cyt b gene for 136 individuals collected in 22 localities. The results revealed that H. polygyrus populations are separated into five major units corresponding to the Italian, northern European (Denmark and Ireland), Iberian, western European, and Balkan populations. Different subclades were also observed within the first two groups. Based on the rate of molecular evolution of H. polygyrus cyt b gene-estimated to 3.5%-3.7% divergence per million years (Myr) in a previous study - the isolation time of the five clades was estimated between 2.5 +/- 0.24 and 1.5 +/- 0.23 million years ago. Moreover, H. polygyrus presents a higher genetic variability in the Mediterranean peninsulas as compared to northwestern Europe, highlighting the role of these regions as refuge areas. Like its specific host, the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, H. polygyrus' pattern of postglacial recolonization of northwestern Europe was initiated from Iberian populations, while Italian and Balkan populations did not expand to the north. The results also suggest the existence of forested and temperate refuges in the southern British Isles during the Quaternary. Finally, the genetic diversity as well as the level of genetic divergence between the lineages of H. polygyrus are compared to those observed in other vertebrate and invertebrate phylogeographical studies: the existence of highly differentiated lineages in H. polygyrus (5%-10% of genetic divergence) highlights that the effects of Pleistocene climate changes on free-living organisms are also reflected in their obligate parasites.

TI A parasite-mediated life-history shift in Daphnia magna
AB The impact of parasitism on host populations will be modulated by both genetic variation for susceptibility, and phenotypically plastic life-history traits that are altered to lessen the fitness consequences of infection. In this study we tested for life-history shifts in the crustacean Daphnia magna following exposure to the horizontally transmitted microsporidian, Glugoides intestinalis. In two separate experiments, we exposed hosts to parasite spores and measured their fecundity relative to controls. We show that hosts exposed to G. intestinalis show fecundity compensation, i.e. hosts shift their life-history strategy towards early reproduction. Our experiments included multiple host genotypes, and subtle differences among them indicated that fecundity compensation could be subject to parasite-mediated natural selection.

TI A simple model for the within-host dynamics of a protozoan parasite
AB The dynamics of parasite-host systems can be complicated if the parasite life cycle contains an obligatory environmental stage and if the hosts' immunity increases upon re-infection. The dynamics then greatly depend on the relation between infection history and parasite uptake and excretion of individual hosts. In an effort to better understand such systems, we study Eimeria spp. in chickens as our model. In this paper we take a first step and study the within-host dynamics of Eimeria spp., transmitted through oocysts in the environment, with a mathematical model for the parasite life cycle in discrete time, interacting with a single variable describing the immune response. The model can explain various types of oocyst input-output behaviour as described in previous experiments, in particular the characteristic crowding effect, which causes a decreasing oocyst production with increasing single dose oocyst uptake. Oocyst excretion during constant oocyst uptake (trickle infection) and the immunizing effect of single and trickle infections also appears in accordance with published experiments. The model seems a good description of oocyst input-output behaviour in individual hosts; it provides a solid basis for the study of between-host dynamics, where individuals interact in a common environment, thereby affecting their own and each other's infection pattern.

TI Host specialization and geographic localization of avian malaria
   parasites: A regional analysis in the Lesser Antilles
AB We recovered 26 genetically distinct avian malaria parasite lineages, based on cytochrome b sequences, from a broad survey of terrestrial avifauna of the Lesser Antilles. Here we describe their distributions across host species within a regional biogeographic context. Most parasite lineages were recovered from a few closely related host species. Specialization on one host species and distribution across many hosts were both rare. Geographic patterns of parasite lineages indicated limited dispersal and frequent local extinction. The central islands of the archipelago share similar parasite lineages and patterns of infection. However, the peripheral islands harbor well-differentiated parasite communities, indicating long periods of isolation. Nonetheless, 20 of 26 parasite lineages were recovered from at least one of three other geographic regions, the Greater Antilles, North America, and South America, suggesting rapid dispersal relative to rate of differentiation. Six parasite lineages were restricted to the Lesser Antilles, primarily to endemic host species. Host differences between populations of the same parasite lineage suggest that host preference may evolve more rapidly than mitochondrial gene sequences. Taken together, distributions of avian malarial parasites reveal evidence of coevolution, host switching, extinction, and periodic recolonization events resulting in ecologically dynamic as well as evolutionarily stable patterns of infection.

TI Evolution toward multi-year periodicity in epidemics
AB We studied why many diseases has multi-year period in their epidemiological dynamics, whereas a main source of the fluctuation is a seasonality with period of 1 year. Previous studies using a compartment model with seasonality in transmission rate succeed to generate a multi-year epidemiological dynamics, when, in particular, the seasonal difference is large. However, these studies have focused on the dynamical consequence of seasonal forcing in epidemiological dynamics and an adaptation of pathogens in the seasonal environment has been neglected. In this paper, we describe our study of the evolution of pathogen's sensitivity to seasonality and show that a larger fluctuation in the transmission rate can be favored in the life history evolution of pathogens, suggesting that multi-year periodicity may evolve by natural selection. Our result proposes a new aspect of the evolution of multi-year epidemics.

Toronto Public Health documented complaints of bed bug infestations from 46 locations in 2003, most commonly apartments (63%), shelters (15%) and rooming houses (11%). Pest control operators in Toronto (N = 34) reported treating bed bug infestations at 847 locations in 2003, most commonly single-family dwellings (70%), apartments (18%), and shelters (8%). Bed bug infestations were reported at 20 (31%) of 65 homeless shelters. At 1 affected shelter, 4% of residents reported having bed bug bites. Bed bug infestations can have an adverse effect on health and quality of life in the general population, particularly among homeless persons living in shelters.

TI The transmission dynamics of groups A and B human respiratory syncytial
   virus (hRSV) in England & Wales and Finland: seasonality and
   cross-protection
AB Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) transmission dynamics are inherently cyclical, and the observed genetic diversity (between groups A and B) also appears to have a repeating pattern. A key unknown is the extent to which genetic variants interact immunologically, and thus impact on epidemiology. We developed a novel mathematical model for hRSV transmission including seasonal forcing of incidence and temporary intra- and inter-group partial immunity. Simultaneous model fits to data from two locations (England H Wales, UK, and Turku, Finland) successfully reproduced the contrasting infection dynamics and group A/B dominance patterns. Parameter estimates are consistent with direct estimates. Differences in the magnitude and seasonal variation in contact rate between the two populations alone could account for the variation in dynamics between these populations. The A/B group dominance patterns are explained by reductions in susceptibility to and infectiousness of secondary homologous and heterologous infections. The consequences of the observed dynamic complexity are discussed.

TI An empirical study of the evolution of virulence under both horizontal
   and vertical transmission
AB According to current thinking, a parasite's transmission mode will be a major determinant of virulence, defined as the harm induced by parasites to their hosts. With horizontal transmission, virulence will increase as a byproduct of a trade-off between fitness gained through increased among-host transmission (infectivity) and fitness lost through increased virulence. With vertical transmission, virulence will decrease because a parasite's reproductive potential will be maximized only by decreasing harm to the host, allowing parasite transmission to more host offspring. To test both predictions, we transmitted barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) horizontally and then vertically in its host, barley (Hordeum vulgare). After four generations of horizontal transmission, we observed a nearly twofold increase in horizontal infectivity and nearly tripled virulence. After three generations of subsequent vertical transmission, we observed a modest (16%) increase in vertical transmissibility and a large (40%) reduction in virulence. Increased horizontal transmission is often due to increased pathogen replication which, in turn, causes increased virulence. However, we found no correlation between within-host virus concentration and virulence, indicating that the observed changes in virulence were not due to changes in viral titer. Finally, horizontally transmitted BSMV had reduced vertical transmission and vertically transmitted BSMV had reduced horizontal infectivity. These two observations suggest that, in nature, in different host populations with varying opportunities for horizontal and vertical transmission, different viral strains may be favored.

TI In vivo transcriptome of Plasmodium falciparum reveals overexpression of
   transcripts that encode surface proteins
AB Infections with the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum continue to present a great challenge to global health. Fundamental questions regarding the molecular basis of virulence and immune evasion in P. falciparum have been only partially answered. Because of the parasite's intracellular location and complex life cycle, standard genetic approaches to the study of the pathogenesis of malaria have been limited. The present study presents a novel approach to the identification of the biological processes involved in host-pathogen interactions, one that is based on the analysis of in vivo P. falciparum transcripts. We demonstrate that a sufficient quantity of P. falciparum RNA transcripts can be derived from a small blood sample from infected patients for whole-genome microarray analysis. Overall, excellent correlation was observed between the transcriptomes derived from in vivo samples and in vitro samples with ring-stage P. falciparum 3D7 reference strain. However, gene families that encode surface proteins are overexpressed in vivo. Moreover, this analysis has identified a new family of hypothetical genes that may encode surface variant antigens. Comparative studies of the transcriptomes derived from in vivo samples and in vitro 3D7 samples may identify important strategies used by the pathogen for survival in the human host and highlight, for vaccine development, new candidate antigens that were not previously identified through the use of in vitro cultures.

We surveyed 10 species of fly parasitoids (Pseudacteon spp.) and one inquiline social parasite, Solenopsis daguerrei, for the presence and sequence identity (wsp gene) of Wolbachia. Two Wolbachia variants infecting S. daguerrei were identical to known variants infecting the two common ant host species, Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri, suggesting possible transfers of Wolbachia between this parasite and their hosts have occurred. Our data also revealed an unexpectedly high diversity of Wolbachia variants within S. daguerrei: up to eight variants were found within each individual, which, to our knowledge, is the highest reported number of Wolbachia variants infecting a single individual of any host species.

TI Transmission dynamics of parasitic sea lice from farm to wild salmon
AB Marine salmon farming has been correlated with parasitic sea lice infestations and concurrent declines of wild salmonids. Here, we report a quantitative analysis of how a single salmon farm altered the natural transmission dynamics of sea lice to juvenile Pacific salmon. We studied infections of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus sabnonis and Caligus clemensi) on juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) as they passed an isolated salmon farm during their seaward migration down two long and narrow corridors. Our calculations suggest the infection pressure imposed by the farm was four orders of magnitude greater than ambient levels, resulting in a maximum infection pressure near the farm that was 73 times greater than ambient levels and exceeded ambient levels for 30 km along the two wild salmon migration corridors. The farm-produced cohort of lice parasitizing the wild juvenile hosts reached reproductive maturity and produced a second generation of lice that re-infected the juvenile salmon. This raises the infection pressure from the farm by an additional order of magnitude, with a composite infection pressure that exceeds ambient levels for 75 km of the two migration routes. Amplified sea lice infestations due to salmon farms are a potential limiting factor to wild salmonid conservation.

TI Glycosaminoglycans mediate invasion and survival of Enterococcus
   faecalis into macrophages
AB Enterococcus faecalis is responsible for a large variety of nosocomial infections. The intestinal barrier is thought to be one of the preferential portals of entry of enterococci, and the ability of E. faecalis to survive within peritoneal macrophages may contribute to spreading to distant sites. We examined the ability of a polysaccharide-expressing (biofilm-positive) E. faecalis strain and an isogenic biofilm-negative mutant to enter and survive within professional and nonprofessional phagocytes. Biofilm-positive bacteria survived longer in all cell systems than did biofilm-negative bacteria, through a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis that is dependent on functional reorganization of microtubules and polymerization of microfilament and on activation of protein kinases but not ATPases or protein phosphatases. We suggest that glycosaminoglycans-specifically heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate A-are the host receptors for enterococci on professional and, possibly, nonprofessional phagocytes, allowing entry of enterococci into cell compartments where killing mechanisms are inhibited.

TI Epidemic malaria in the highlands of Papua New Guinea
AB As part of a larger study into the epidemiology of malaria in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, outbreak investigations were carried out at the end of the 2002 rainy season in 11 villages situated between 1,400 and 1,700 meters above sea level that had reported epidemics. Locations and timing of these epidemics corresponded largely to those reported in the pre-control era of the 1960s and 1970s. On average, 28.8% (range = 10.3-63.2%) of people in each of the 11 villages were found to be infected with malaria. Plasmodium falciparium accounted for 59% of all identified infections and A vivax for 34%. The majority (53%) of infections were symptomatic. Although symptomatic infections were most common in children 2-9 years of age (36%), even in adults a prevalence of 20% was observed. A comparison with earlier non-epidemic data in three of the villages without easy access to health care showed markedly increased levels of morbidity, with 6-10-fold increases in parasite prevalence, a 3-fold increase in both measured and reported fevers, and a 12-fold increase in enlarged spleens. The average hemoglobin levels were reduced by 2.3-3.5 g/dL, with a concurrent increase in moderate to severe anemia (hemoglobin level < 7.5 g/dL) from 0.0-3.3% to 3.8-18.4%. These massive increases in morbidity have devastating impact on the affected communities and highlight that malaria epidemics are a serious and increasing public health problem in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.

TI Maintenance of sex-linked deleterious alleles by selfing and group
   selection in metapopulations of the phytopathogenic fungus Microbotryum
   violaceum
AB Microbotryum violaceum is a fungus that causes the sterilizing anther smut disease in many Caryophyllaceae. Its diploid teliospores are heterozygous at the mating-type locus, normally producing equal proportions of haploid sporidia of the two mating types. However, natural populations contain high frequencies of individuals producing sporidia of only one mating type. This mating-type ratio bias is caused by the presence of deleterious alleles at haploid phase ("haplo-lethals") linked to the mating-type locus. These haplo-lethals can be transmitted if there is conjugation among the products of meiosis (intratetrad selfing). Haplo-lethals still suffer from selective disadvantages, through reducing the infection probability of strains that carry them, and thus cannot persist in a panmictic population. We develop a realistic model of a metapopulation of M. violaceum on its host Silene latifolia. Simulations show that if intratetrad selfing rate is high, haplo-lethals can be maintained under a metapopulation structure because of founder effects and selection at the population level. Populations founded only by strains carrying haplo-lethals experience a lower extinction rate precisely because of their lower infection ability; they spread more slowly and sterilize fewer plants, thereby allowing their host population to grow more rapidly and therefore to be less prone to extinction.

   health
AB Investigations of biological invasions focus on patterns and processes that are related to introduction, establishment, spread and impacts of introduced species. This review focuses on the ecological interactions operating during invasions by the most prominent group of insect vectors of disease, mosquitoes. First, we review characteristics of non-native mosquito species that have established viable populations, and those invasive species that have spread widely and had major impacts, testing whether biotic characteristics are associated with the transition from established non-native to invasive. Second, we review the roles of interspecific competition, apparent competition, predation, intraguild predation and climatic limitation as causes of impacts on residents or as barriers to invasion. We concentrate on the best-studied invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, evaluating the application of basic ecological theory to invasions by Aedes albopictus. We develop a model based on observations of Aedes albopictus for effects of resource competition and predation as barriers to invasion, evaluating which community and ecosystem characteristics favour invasion. Third, we evaluate the ways in which invasive mosquitoes have contributed to outbreaks of human and animal disease, considering specifically whether invasive mosquitoes create novel health threats, or modify disease transmission for existing pathogen-host systems.

TI Invasion and dynamics of covert infection strategies in structured
   insect-pathogen populations
AB 1. Pathogens are known to cause horizontally transmitted overt (fully symptomatic) and vertically transmitted covert (asymptomatic) infections. Here, we explore a range of different covert infection strategies on the persistence and dynamics of insect host-pathogen interactions.
   2. The three strategies we explore are (i) sublethal infections in which hosts survive initial infection but suffer costs on fecundity or development, (ii) persistent infections, which are transmitted vertically with minimal costs on fecundity and development and which also confer immunity against superinfection and (iii) persistent infections without immunity against superinfection.
   3. We examine the conditions that allow these three strategies to invade. We find that sublethal infections can act to modulate the population dynamics (i.e. cause changes in amplitude and periodicity of cycles) as well as inducing different dynamics (stable and unstable states). This is in line with empirical findings.
   4. Covert infection strategies are also able to generate novel dynamics. In particular, over a wide range of parameter space the predicted dynamics of the covert infections without immunity are of a persistent stable interaction solely between the covertly infected hosts and the pathogen, with the exclusion of clean susceptible hosts.
   5. Our results suggest that, in general, host-pathogen interactions may be maintained in low-level persistent endemic states without the propensity to show the cyclic oscillations characteristic of enemy-victim interactions. Understanding host-pathogen dynamics requires a knowledge of the factors involved, such as covert infections, that may compensate for the destabilizing effects of time-lags.

   2. Bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) and brucellosis (Brucella abortus), were introduced to Wood Buffalo National Park in the late 1920s. As each of these pathogens has the potential to reduce survival and reproduction in bison, they are suspected to have played a role in the decline in bison abundance.
   3. We live-captured bison in the winters of 1997-2000, tested for tuberculosis, brucellosis and pregnancy and released animals with radio transmitters to evaluate survival.
   4. We found that bison that were positive for both diseases were less likely to be pregnant or to survive the winter than bison positive for one or neither disease. Further, in one population, bison that were tuberculosis-positive had a substantially lower pregnancy probability.
   5. Demonstrating a negative effect of diseases on survival and reproduction is a necessary, but not sufficient, test of the role of diseases in bison population decline.

TI A chemical level in the coevolutionary arms race between an ant social
   parasite and its hosts
AB Here we investigate the coevolutionary interactions between the slavemaking ant Protomognathus americanus and its Temnothorax hosts on a chemical level. We show that, although this social parasite is principally well-adapted to its hosts' cuticular hydrocarbon profile, there are pronounced differences in the fine-tuning of this adaptation. Between populations, chemical adaptation varies with host community composition, as the parasite faces a trade-off when confronted with more than one host species. In addition to adaptation of its own chemical signature, the slavemaker causes a reciprocal adjustment in its slaves' cuticular profile, the degree of which depends on the slave species. On the host side, successful parasite defence requires efficient enemy recognition, and in behavioural aggression trials, host colonies could indeed discriminate between invading slaves, which commonly accompany slavemakers on raids, and free-living conspecifics. Furthermore, hosts shifted their acceptance threshold over the seasons, presumably to reduce the costs of defence.

TI Rates of HIV-1 transmission per coital act, by stage of HIV-1 infection,
   in Rakai, Uganda
AB Background. We estimated rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transmission per coital act in HIV-discordant couples by stage of infection in the index partner.
   Methods. We retrospectively identified 235 monogamous, HIV-discordant couples in a Ugandan population-based cohort. HIV transmission within pairs was confirmed by sequence analysis. Rates of transmission per coital act were estimated by the index partner's stage of infection (recent seroconversion or prevalent or late-stage infection). The adjusted rate ratio of transmission per coital act was estimated by multivariate Poisson regression.
   Results. The average rate of HIV transmission was 0.0082/coital act (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0039-0.0150) within similar to 2.5 months after seroconversion of the index partner; 0.0015/coital act within 6-15 months after seroconversion of the index partner (95% CI, 0.0002-0.0055); 0.0007/coital act (95% CI, 0.0005-0.0010) among HIV-prevalent index partners; and 0.0028/coital act (95% CI, 0.0015-0.0041) 6-25 months before the death of the index partner. In adjusted models, early- and late-stage infection, higher HIV load, genital ulcer disease, and younger age of the index partner were significantly associated with higher rates of transmission.
   Conclusions. The rate of HIV transmission per coital act was highest during early-stage infection. This has implications for HIV prevention and for projecting the effects of antiretroviral treatment on HIV transmission.

TI Altitude-dependent and -independent variations in Plasmodium falciparum
   prevalence in northeastern Tanzania
AB Background. Effective malaria control requires information about intensity of transmission across large areas and populations. Estimates based on entomological factors lack precision and are not cost-effective to obtain. We tested altitude and rainfall measurements as correlates of transmission intensity in different ecological settings.
   Methods. We conducted 2 cross-sectional surveys of similar to 12,000 people ( 1 - 45 years old) in 6 altitude transects ( 150 - 1800 m) in the Kilimanjaro and Tanga regions of Tanzania. Data were analyzed for associations with altitude and rainfall estimates by use of appropriate regression models.
   Results. Plasmodium falciparum prevalence showed a negative relationship with altitude (19% and 21% decrease/100-m altitude increase, respectively, in children in Kilimanjaro and Tanga) and rainfall during the 3 months before the survey (46% decrease/100-mm rainfall increase in children in Kilimanjaro). Mean hemoglobin concentrations increased with altitude (0.05 and 0.09 g/dL/100-m altitude increase, respectively, in children in Kilimanjaro and Tanga) and rainfall (0.17 g/dL/100-mm rainfall increase in children and adults in Kilimanjaro).
   Discussion. Altitude and rainfall were correlated with parasite prevalence and mean hemoglobin concentration; however, the relationship varied according to ecological setting. Climatological variables alone cannot predict malarial outcomes. Local variations in seasonality of malaria transmission - together with vector species composition, topography, host and parasite genetics, and socioeconomic factors - may influence malaria prevalence.

TI Host diversity begets parasite diversity: bird final hosts and
   trematodes in snail intermediate hosts
AB An unappreciated facet of biodiversity is that rich communities and high abundance may foster parasitism. For parasites that sequentially use different host species throughout complex life cycles, parasite diversity and abundance in 'downstream' hosts should logically increase with the diversity and abundance of,upstream' hosts (which carry the preceding stages of parasites). Surprisingly, this logical assumption has little empirical support, especially regarding metazoan parasites. Few studies have attempted direct tests of this idea and most have lacked the appropriate scale of investigation. In two different studies, we used time-lapse videography to quantify birds at fine spatial scales, and then related bird communities to larval trematode communities in snail populations sampled at the same small spatial scales. Species richness, species heterogeneity and abundance of final host birds were positively correlated with species richness, species heterogeneity and abundance of trematodes in host snails. Such community-level interactions have rarely been demonstrated and have implications for community theory, epidemiological theory and ecosystem management.

   on uncultivated and related cultivated host plants
AB Habitats in agroecosystems are ephemeral, and are characterized by frequent disturbances forcing pest species to successively colonize various hosts belonging either to the cultivated or to the uncultivated part of the agricultural landscape. The role of wild habitats as reservoirs or refuges for the aphid Sitobion avenae that colonize cultivated fields was assessed by investigating the genetic structure of populations collected on both cereal crops (wheat, barley and oat) and uncultivated hosts (Yorkshire fog, cocksfoot, bulbous oatgrass and tall oatgrass) in western France.
   Classical genetic analyses and Bayesian clustering algorithms indicate that genetic differentiation is high between populations collected on uncultivated hosts and on crops, revealing a relatively limited gene flow between the uncultivated margins and the cultivated part of the agroecosystem. A closer genetic relatedness was observed between populations living on plants belonging to the same tribe (Triticeae, Poeae and Aveneae tribes) where aphid genotypes appeared not to be specialized on a single host, but rather using a group of related plant species. Causes of this ecological differentiation and its implications for integrated pest management of S. avenae as cereals pest are discussed.

In the current study, we demonstrated that DBP is naturally immunogenic in different populations of the Brazilian Amazon, and the proportions of DBP IgG positive subjects increased with exposure to malaria, reaching a peak in those subjects with long-term exposure (> 15 years) in the Amazon area. This profile of antibody response was significantly different from the one observed for the P. viva-V merozoite surface protein 1 (MSPI19), which was relatively uniform in areas with markedly different levels of malaria transmission. In a small sample of adults with symptomless P. vivax infection, we could not detect any significant correlation between antibodies against these P. vivax proteins and asymptomatic infection. Our study provided an additional insight by demonstrating cumulative exposure as a determinant that acts independently of host age in generation of anti-DBP IgG response.

AB Intensity profiles for helminths are used to describe population infection status, monitor effectiveness of control programs, and provide accurate data to validate transmission models. This study aims to accurately predict age/gender specific intensity profiles of endemic schistosomiasis japonica infection in the Philippines. Poor sensitivity of the kato-Katz test and large heterogeneity in infection levels across villages complicate these predictions. Data from 1,989 individuals living in three endemic villages were analyzed with a Bayesian cumulative-logit model adjusting for nonproportional odds, variation between villages, and measurement error. The posterior uncertainty regarding the proportion of individuals in each egg category was high compared with that estimated using a model ignoring measurement error and villages' heterogeneity. The intensity profiles were very different in children less than 7 years old compared with older children and adults. This model could easily be adapted to other parasitic infections or outcomes where an analysis by category would be recommended.

TI Emergence of a convex trade-off between transmission and virulence
AB Most models of virulence evolution assume that a parasite cannot raise its transmission rate without causing more harm to its host. However, the existence of such trade-off relationships has recently been challenged. Here, we study how a trade-off can emerge from a model that explicitly incorporates within-host dynamics. We find that the existence and the convexity of the trade-off are robust, which implies a definite level of evolutionarily stable virulence (ESV) for the parasite. However, we also show that the dependence of the ESV on parameter values may be very strong. One possible consequence of this sensitivity is that relationships between transmission and virulence observed across populations need not conform to the patterns expected on the basis of a common (fixed) trade-off. We discuss possible experiments and implications of our results for the development of virulence management strategies.

TI Patterns of spread and persistence of foot-and-mouth disease types A, O
   and Asia-1 in Turkey: a meta-population approach
AB Despite significant control efforts, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) persists in Turkey, and new strains of serotypes A, O and Asia-1 are periodically reported to enter the country from the east. The status of FMD in Turkey is important regionally because the country forms a natural bridge between Asia where the disease is endemic, and Europe which has disease-free status. This study analysed spatial and temporal patterns of FMD occurrence in Turkey to explore factors associated with the disease's persistence and spread. Annual records of FMD distribution in Turkish provinces throughout 1990-2002, grouped by serotype (O, A and Asia 1), were analysed using geostatistical techniques to explore their spatial and temporal patterns. A meta-population model was used to test how disease status, expressed in terms of presence/absence, extinction, and colonization, and measured at the province level throughout the periods 1990-1996 and 1997-2002, could be predicted using province-level data on: ruminant livestock numbers; meat production-demand discrepancy (as a surrogate measure of animal and animal products marketing, i.e. long-distance contagion through the traffic of mainly live animals to urban centres); and the disease prevalence distribution as recorded for the previous year. A drastic overall reduction in FMD occurrence was observed from the period 1990-1996 to 1997-2002 when the disease was shown to retract into persistence islands. FMD occurrence was associated with host abundance, short distance contagion from adjacent provinces, and meat production-demand discrepancies. With FMD retracting into identified provinces, a shift in predictors of FMD occurrence was observed with a lower contribution of short-distance contagion, and a relatively higher association with meat production-demand discrepancies leading to live animal transport over long distances, and hence presenting opportunities for identifying critical-control points. The pattern of persistence differed according to serotype groups and is discussed in relation to their differential affinity to cattle and small ruminant hosts.

TI Incidence and persistence of classical swine fever in free-ranging wild
   boar (Sus scrofa)
AB Although veterinary authorities aim to limit persistence of classical swine fever (CSF) in wild boar (Sits scrofa), to avoid potential transmission to pigs, factors influencing CSF transmission and persistence are not clearly understood. Here we analyse incidence and persistence in a CSF epidemic that occurred in the French Vosges Forest. Higher incidence was found in large forests compared to smaller isolated ones, being highest near the starting point of the epidemic, but poorly related to the local density. We hypothesize that the spatial and social structure of wild boar populations may be responsible for this variability of incidence over space. Persistence was highest near the starting point of the epidemic and where initial density was highest. We hypothesize that persistence was favoured by the abundance of young wild boar, itself encouraged by CSF. Our results allow us to propose management measures aimed at limiting CSF persistence.

TI Seroprevalence of human papillomavirus type 16 in children
AB We evaluated the prevalence of antibodies to human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 in a representative sample of children 6-11 years of age in the United States. Serum samples and questionnaire data were collected between 1991 and 1994, for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. HPV-16-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies were detected by an HPV-16 L1 virus-like particle-based enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. Overall, 2.4% of 1316 children 6-11 years of age were seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher in boys than in girls (3.5% vs. 1.2%; P = .08) and in children >7 years of age than in children <= 7 years of age (3.3% vs. 0.4%; P < .05). None of the variables tested for, including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and urban or rural residence, were significantly associated with HPV-16 seropositivity. To explain HPV-16 seropositivity in this population, further study is required.

TI Growth of Listeria monocytogenes in the guinea pig placenta and role of
   cell-to-cell spread in fetal infection
AB Listeria monocytogenes causes foodborne outbreaks that lead to infection in human and other mammalian fetuses. To elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in transplacental transmission, we characterized placental-fetal infection in pregnant guinea pigs inoculated with wild-type (wt) or mutant L. monocytogenes strains. The wt strain increased in number in the placenta by >1000-fold during the first 24 h after inoculation-an increase that was unparalleled in other maternal organs. The ActA(-) mutant, which is impaired in cell-to-cell spread and attenuated in maternal organs, increased in the placenta by a similar amount, although, in fetal infection, the number of ActA(-) mutant bacteria was 100-fold lower, compared with that of the wt strain. Furthermore, a mutant impaired in vacuolar escape was rapidly eliminated from maternal organs but persisted in the placenta. We concluded that cell-to-cell spread facilitates maternal-to-fetal transmission. Furthermore, the placenta provides a protective niche for growth of L. monocytogenes.

TI Problem pathogens: extra-intestinal complications of Salmonella enterica
   serotype Typhi infection
AB Typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica seroptype Typhi (S typhi), has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 12-33 million cases. The pathogenesis of this disease depends on the ingested inoculum size of S typhi, the virulence of the strain, the host's immune response and previous exposure, and local protective factors. Numerous extra-intestinal complications can occur with S typhi infection, including the involvement of the central nervous system (3-35%), cardiovascular system (1-5%), pulmonary system (1-86%), bone and joints (<= l%), hepatobiliary system (1-26%), genitourinary system (< l%), and others. Due to an increase in multidrug-resistant S typhi, fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins have been increasingly used for typhoid fever and its complications. We describe the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and treatment of extra-intestinal S typhi infections.
