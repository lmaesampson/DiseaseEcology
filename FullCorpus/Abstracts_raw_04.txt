TI alpha-defensin inhibits influenza virus replication by cell-mediated
   mechanism(s)
AB The innate immune system mounts the first host response to pathogens. Because alpha-defensins, which are cationic antimicrobial peptides of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and other leukocytes, are important effectors of the innate immune system, we studied the antiviral activity of human (x-defensin-l (also known as "human neutrophil peptide-1" [HNP-1]) against influenza virus in vitro. Treatment of cell cultures with HNP-1 soon after infection resulted in marked inhibition of influenza virus replication and viral protein synthesis. This effect was not due to cytotoxicity or to a direct effect on the virus. Treatment of cells with HNP-1 followed by its removal before infection also inhibited viral replication, suggesting that the inhibition was due to the modulation of cellular pathways. HNP-1 treatment inhibited protein kinase C (PKC) activation in infected cells, suggesting the involvement of the PKC pathway. Our data expand the previously known activity of cedefensins against influenza virus. Characterizing the mechanism of action of alpha-defensins may lead to the identification of new strategies for prevention and therapy.

TI Human herpesvirus-8 infection and oral shedding in Amerindian and
   non-amerindian populations in the Brazilian Amazon region
AB Background. Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) is hyperendemic in Amerindian populations, but its modes of transmission are unknown.
   Methods. Antibodies against either HHV-8 lytic antigen or HHV-8 latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) were detected, by immunofluorescence assays, in 339 Amerindians and 181 non-Amerindians from the Brazilian Amazon. Serological markers of oro-fecal (hepatitis A), parenteral (hepatitis B and Q, and sexual (herpes simplex virus type 2 and syphilis) transmission were measured by specific ELISAs. Salivary HHV-8 DNA was detected by use of a nested polymerase chain reaction assay and was sequenced.
   Results. Antibodies against either lytic antigen or LANA were detected in 79.1% of Amerindians and in 6.1% of non-Amerindians (adjusted, seroprevalence ratio [SR], 12.63 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.1-22.4]; P<.0001). HHV-8 seroprevalence increased with age among Amerindians (P-Trend < .001) and already had high prevalence in childhood but was not sex specific in either population. The 2 populations did not differ in seroprevalence of oro-fecal or parenteral markers, but seroprevalence of markers of sexual transmission was lower among Amerindians. HHV-8 DNA in saliva was detected in 47 (23.7%) of 198 HHV-8 seropositive Amerindians. Detection of HHV-8 DNA decreased with age (P-Trend < .04) and was more common in men (SR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.3-3.5]; P = .003). A total of 36 (76.6%) of the 47 saliva HHV-8 DNA samples were sequenced, and all clustered as subtype E.
   Conclusion. The data support the hypothesis of early acquisition and horizontal transmission, via saliva, of HHV-8 subtype E in Amerindian populations.

TI Cellular immunity to mumps virus in young adults 21 years after
   measles-mumps-rubella vaccination
AB Background. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination has decreased the incidence of measles, Mumps, and rubella virus infections in several countries. However, the persistence of MMR vaccine-induced immunity in the absence of endemic infection has remained unknown.
   Methods. The persistence of cellular and Immoral immunity to mumps virus was studied in 50 individuals (group A) who had been vaccinated twice with MMR vaccine during early childhood and were followed up for 21 years after their first vaccination. Eleven individuals (group B) with naturally acquired immunity to mumps virus were studied for comparison.
   Results. Anti-mumps virus IgG antibodies were detectable (titer >= 230) in 72% of the vaccinces. A mumps antigen-specific lymphoproliferative response (defined as a stimulatory index [SI] >= 3) was observed in 98% of group A subjects (mean +/- SD SI, 26 +/- 30 [range, 0.5-252]) and in 100% of group B subjects (mean +/- SD SI, 22 27 [range, 5-123]). Significant mumps antigen-specific interferon-gamma production was detected in 73% of subjects in both groups A and B, and interleukin-10 production was detected in 40% and 36% of group A and B subjects, respectively.
   Conclusions. All presently seronegative vaccinees (n = 14) had mumps antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses, and only I of the seropositive vaccinees (n = 36) was devoid of detectable cellular immunity. The results suggest a very long persistence of vaccine-induced anti-mumps virus cellular immunity.

TI The effects of sulphide on growth and behaviour of the thiotrophic
   Zoothamnium niveum symbiosis
AB Zoothamnium niveum ( Ciliophora, Oligohymenophora) is a giant, colonial marine ciliate from sulphide-rich, shallow-water habitats, obligatorily associated with the ectosymbiotic, chemoautotrophic, sulphide-oxidizing bacterium 'Candidatus Thiobios zoothamnicoli'. The aims of this study were to characterize the natural habitat and investigate growth, reproduction, survival and maintenance of the symbiosis from Corsica, France ( Mediterranean Sea) using a flow-through respirometer providing stable chemical conditions. We were able to successfully cultivate the Z. niveum symbiosis during its entire lifespan and document reproduction, whereby the optimum conditions were found to range from 3 to 33 mu mol1(-1) Sigma H2S in normoxic seawater. Starting with an inoculum of 13 specimens, we found up to 173 new specimens that were asexually produced after only 11 days. Observed mean lifespan of the Z. niveum colonies was approximately 11 days and mean colony size reached 51 branches, from which rapid host division rates of up to every 4.1 hours were calculated. Comparing the ectosymbiotic population from Z. niveum colonies collected from their natural habitat with those cultivated under optimal conditions, we found significant differences in the bacterial morphology and the frequency of dividing cells on distinct host parts, which is most likely caused by behaviour of the host ciliate. Applying different sulphide concentrations we revealed that the symbiosis was not able to survive without sulphide and was harmed by high sulphide conditions. To our knowledge, this study reports the first successful cultivation of a thiotrophic ectosymbiosis.

TI Control of a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in the GB
   poultry flock
AB The identification of H5N1 in domestic poultry in Europe has increased the risk of infection reaching most industrialized poultry populations. Here, using detailed data on the poultry population in Great Britain ( GB), we show that currently planned interventions based on movement restrictions can be expected to control the majority of outbreaks. The probability that controls fail to keep an outbreak small only rises to significant levels if most transmission occurs via mechanisms which are both untraceable and largely independent of the local density of premises. We show that a predictor of the need to intensify control efforts in GB is whether an outbreak exceeds 20 infected premises. In such a scenario neither localized reactive vaccination nor localized culling are likely to have a substantial impact. The most effective of these contingent interventions are large radius ( 10 km) localized culling and national vaccination. However, the modest impact of these approaches must be balanced against their substantial inconvenience and cost.

TI An algorithm to estimate the importance of bacterial acquisition routes
   in hospital settings
AB An algorithm is presented to calculate likelihoods of acquisition routes using only individual patient data concerning period of stay and microbiologic surveillance (without genotyping). The algorithm also produces estimates for the prevalence and the number of acquisitions by each route. The algorithm is applied to colonization data of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) from September 2001 to May 2002 in two intensive care units (ICUs) (n=277 and n= 180, respectively) of Utrecht, Kingdom of the Netherlands. Genotyping and epidemiologic linkage are used as the reference standard. Surveillance cultures were obtained on admission and twice weekly thereafter. All CRIES were genotyped. According to the reference standard, the daily prevalence of CRE in ICU-1 and ICU-2 was 26.1% (standard deviation: 15.4) and 15.1% (standard deviation: 13.4), respectively, with five of 23 (21.7%) and six of 21 (28.6%) cases of acquired colonization being of exogenous origin, respectively. On the basis of the algorithm, the endogenous route was responsible for more acquisitions than the exogenous route (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001 for ICU-1 and ICU-2, respectively). The estimated number of acquisitions is 30 and 27, and the estimated prevalence is 27.6% and 17.6% for ICU-1 and ICU-2, respectively. By use of longitudinal colonization data only, the algorithm determines the relative importance of acquisition routes taking patient dependency into account.

TI Coexistence of Trypanosoma cruzi genotypes in wild and periodomestic
   mammals in Chile
AB Epidemiologic evidence suggests a preferential association of Trypanosoma critzi genotypes TCI and TCII with marsupials and placental mammals, respectively. We identify T cruzi genotypes from 117 infected mammals. Minicircle DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction and hybridization with a panel of four specific probes showed frequencies for the T cruzi genotypes TCI, TCIIb, TCIId, and TCIIe of 38%, 41%, 26%, and 9%, respectively, in wild mammals. In peridomestic mammals, frequencies for the same clones were 29%, 33%, 43%, and 14%, respectively. As a whole, mixed infections are found in more than 31% of the cases, which indicates the coexistence of multiclonal strains circulating in nature, and the absence of specific associations between T cruzi genotypes and reservoir hosts, including marsupials. The direct characterization of parasite genotypes emphasizes the importance of obtaining unbiased epidemiologic information from parasite-endemic areas. Results are discussed in the context of competition or facilitation of T cruzi genotypes within hosts.

TI Genetic influences on mosquito feeding behavior and the emergence of
   zoonotic pathogens
AB The feeding behavior of vectors influences the likelihood of pathogen invasion and the exposure of humans to vector-borne zoonotic pathogens. We used multilocus microsatellite genetic typing of an introduced mosquito vector and DNA sequencing of mosquito blood meals to determine the impact of hybrid ancestry on feeding behavior and the emergence of West Nile virus (WNV). The probability of ancestry of Culex pipiens mosquitoes from two bionomically divergent forms, form molestus and form pipiens, influenced the probability that they fed on humans but did not explain a late summer feeding shift from birds to humans. We used a simple model to show that the occurrence of pure form molestus mosquitoes would have decreased the likelihood of WNV invasion (R-0 in bird populations) 3- to 8-fold, whereas the occurrence of pure forms pipiens mosquitoes would have halved human exposure compared with the hybrids that are present. Data and modeling suggest that feeding preferences may be influenced by genetic ancestry and contribute to the emergence of vector-borne pathogens transmitted by introduced species, including malaria, and dengue, Chikungunya, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses.

TI A major epidemic of Chikungunya virus infection on Reunion Island,
   France, 2005-2006
AB In January 2005, an epidemic of chikungunya fever broke out in the Comoro Islands and lasted until May 2005. In April, cases were also reported in Mayotte and Mauritius. On Reunion Island, the first cases were reported at the end of April. Surveillance of this epidemic required an adaptive system, which at first was based on active and retrospective case detection around the cases reported, then relied on a sentinel network when the incidence increased. Emerging and severe forms of infection were investigated. Death certificates were monitored. By April 2006, the surveillance estimate was 244,000 cases of chikungunya virus infection, including 123 severe cases and 41 of maternoneonatal transmission, with an overall attack rate of 35%. Chikungunya infection was mentioned on 203 death certificates and significant mortality was observed. This epidemic highlighted the need for a mutual strategy of providing information on arboviral diseases and their prevention and control between countries in the southwestern Indian Ocean.

TI Infectious diseases and extinction risk in wild mammals
AB Parasite-driven declines in wildlife have become increasingly common and can pose significant risks to natural populations. We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and compiled data on hosts threatened by infectious disease and their parasites to better understand the role of infectious disease in contemporary host extinctions. The majority of mammal species considered threatened by parasites were either carnivores or artiodactyls, two clades that include the majority of domesticated animals. Parasites affecting host threat status were predominantly viruses and bacteria that infect a wide range of host species, including domesticated animals. Counter to our predictions, parasites transmitted by close contact were more likely to cause extinction risk than those transmitted by other routes. Mammal species threatened by parasites were not better studied for infectious diseases than other threatened mammals and did not have more parasites or differ in four key traits demonstrated to affect parasite species richness in other comparative studies. Our findings underscore the need for better information concerning the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases in populations of endangered mammals. In addition, our results suggest that evolutionary similarity to domesticated animals may be a key factor associated with parasite-mediated declines, thus, efforts to limit contact between domesticated hosts and wildlife could reduce extinction risk.

TI Sensitivity to assumptions in models of generalist predation on a cyclic
   prey
AB Ecological theory predicts that generalist predators should damp or suppress long-term periodic fluctuations ( cycles) in their prey populations and depress their average densities. However, the magnitude of these impacts is likely to vary depending on the availability of alternative prey species and the nature of ecological mechanisms driving the prey cycles. These multispecies effects can be modeled explicitly if parameterized functions relating prey consumption to prey abundance, and realistic population dynamical models for the prey, are available. These requirements are met by the interaction between the Hen Harrier ( Circus cyaneus) and three of its prey species in the United Kingdom, the Meadow Pipit ( Anthus pratensis), the field vole ( Microtus agrestis), and the Red Grouse ( Lagopus lagopus scoticus). We used this system to investigate how the availability of alternative prey and the way in which prey dynamics are modeled might affect the behavior of simple trophic networks. We generated cycles in one of the prey species ( Red Grouse) in three different ways: through ( 1) the interaction between grouse density and macroparasites, ( 2) the interaction between grouse density and male grouse aggressiveness, and ( 3) a generic, delayed density-dependent mechanism. Our results confirm that generalist predation can damp or suppress grouse cycles, but only when the densities of alternative prey are low. They also demonstrate that diametrically opposite indirect effects between pairs of prey species can occur together in simple systems. In this case, pipits and grouse are apparent competitors, whereas voles and grouse are apparent facilitators. Finally, we found that the quantitative impacts of the predator on prey density differed among the three models of prey dynamics, and these differences were robust to uncertainty in parameter estimation and environmental stochasticity.

TI Applying population-genetic models in theoretical evolutionary
   epidemiology
AB Much of the existing theory for the evolutionary biology of infectious diseases uses an invasion analysis approach. In this Ideas and Perspectives article, we suggest that techniques from theoretical population genetics can also be profitably used to study the evolutionary epidemiology of infectious diseases. We highlight four ways in which population-genetic models provide benefits beyond those provided by most invasion analyses: (i) they can make predictions about the rate of pathogen evolution; (ii) they explicitly draw out the mechanistic way in which the epidemiological dynamics feed into evolutionary change, and thereby provide new insights into pathogen evolution; (iii) they can make predictions about the evolutionary consequences of non-equilibrium epidemiological dynamics; (iv) they can readily incorporate the effects of multiple host dynamics, and thereby account for phenomena such as immunological history and/or host co-evolution.

TI Confronting potential influenza a (H5NI) pandemic with better vaccines
AB Influenza A (H5N1) viruses are strong candidates for causing the next influenza pandemic if they acquire the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission. A major public health goal is to make efficacious vaccines against these viruses by using novel approaches, including cell-culture system, reverse genetics, and adjuvant development. Important consideration for the strategy includes preparation of vaccines from a currently circulating strain to induce broad-spectrum immunity toward newly emerged human H5 strains. This strategy would be a good solution early in a pandemic until an antigenically matched and approved vaccine is produced. The concept of therapeutic vaccines (e.g., antidisease vaccine) directed at diminishing the cytokine storm frequently seen in subtype H5N1-infected persons is underscored. Better understanding of host-virus interaction is essential to identify tools to produce effective vaccines against influenza (D5N1).

TI A survey of zoonotic pathogens carried by Norway rats in Baltimore,
   Maryland, USA
AB Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) carry several zoonotic pathogens and because rats and humans live in close proximity in urban environments, there exists potential for transmission. To identify zoonotic agents carried by rats in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, we live-trapped 201 rats during 2005-2006 and screened them for a panel of viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Antibodies against Seoul virus (57 center dot 7%), hepatitis E virus (HEV, 73 center dot 5%), Leptospira interrogans (65 center dot 3%), Bartonella elizabethae (34 center dot 1%), and Rickettsia typhi (7 center dot 0%) were detected in Norway rats. Endoparasites, including Calodium hepatica (87 center dot 9%) and Hymenolepis sp. (34 center dot 4%), and ectoparasites (13 center dot 9%, primarily Laelaps echidninus) also were present. The risk of human exposure to these pathogens is a significant public health concern. Because these pathogens cause non-specific and often self-limiting symptoms in humans, infection in human populations is probably underdiagnosed.

TI Emerging epidemic diseases of frogs in Britain are dependent on the
   source of ranavirus agent and the route of exposure
AB A series of transmission studies was conducted to investigate the aetiology, or aetiologies, of emerging fatal epidemic disease syndromes affecting the common frog (Rana temporaria) in Britain. The syndromes, characterized by skin ulceration or systemic haemorrhages, were induced upon exposure to lesion homogenates or cultured ranavirus. The re-isolation of ranavirus frorn experimentally affected frogs fulfilled Koch's postulates. Aeromonas hydrophila, previously associated with similar lesions, was not significant to disease development. Unexpectedly, disease outcomes were influenced by both the source of agent and the route of exposure, indicating that different ranaviruses with different tissue tropisms and pathogeneses (possibly similar to quasi-species in RNA virus populations) are circulating in the British common frog population. Our findings confirm that ranavirus disease has emerged as an important cause of amphibian mortality in Britain.

TI Cryptic speciation and patterns of phenotypic variation of a highly
   variable acanthocephalan parasite
AB An investigation of a parasite species that is broadly host- and habitat-specific and exhibits alternative transmission strategies was undertaken to examine intraspecific variability and if it can be attributed to cryptic speciation or environmentally induced plasticity. Specimens of an acanthocephalan parasite, Leptorhynchoides thecatus, collected throughout North America were analysed phylogenetically using sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I gene and the internal transcribed spacer region. Variation in host use, habitat use, and transmission were examined in a phylogenetic context to determine if they were more likely phylogenetically based or due to environmental influences. Results indicated that most of the variation detected can be explained by the presence of cryptic species. The majority of these species have narrow host and microhabitat specificities although one species, which also may comprise a complex of species, exhibits broad host and habitat specificity. Alternate transmission pathways only occurred in two of the cryptic species and correlate with host use patterns. Taxa that mature in piscivorous piscine hosts use a paratenic fish host to bridge the trophic gap between their amphipod intermediate host and piscivorous definitive host. One potential example of environmentally induced variation was identified in three populations of these parasites, which differ on their abilities to infect different host species.

TI Emergence of recombinant forms of HIV: Dynamics and scaling
AB The ability to accelerate the accumulation of favorable combinations of mutations renders recombination a potent force underlying the emergence of forms of HIV that escape multi-drug therapy and specific host immune responses. We present a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of the emergence of recombinant forms of HIV following infection with diverse viral genomes. Mimicking recent in vitro experiments, we consider target cells simultaneously exposed to two distinct, homozygous viral populations and construct dynamical equations that predict the time evolution of populations of uninfected, singly infected, and doubly infected cells, and homozygous, heterozygous, and recombinant viruses. Model predictions capture several recent experimental observations quantitatively and provide insights into the role of recombination in HIV dynamics. From analyses of data from single-round infection experiments with our description of the probability with which recombination accumulates distinct mutations present on the two genomic strands in a virion, we estimate that similar to 8 recombinational strand transfer events occur on average (95% confidence interval: 6-10) during reverse transcription of HIV in T cells. Model predictions of virus and cell dynamics describe the time evolution and the relative prevalence of various infected cell subpopulations following the onset of infection observed experimentally. Remarkably, model predictions are in quantitative agreement with the experimental scaling relationship that the percentage of cells infected with recombinant genomes is proportional to the percentage of cells coinfected with the two genomes employed at the onset of infection. Our model thus presents an accurate description of the influence of recombination on HIV dynamics in vitro. When distinctions between different viral genomes are ignored, our model reduces to the standard model of viral dynamics, which successfully predicts viral load changes in HIV patients undergoing therapy. Our model may thus serve as a useful framework to predict the emergence of multi-drug-resistant forms of HIV in infected individuals.

TI Comparing Models for Early Warning Systems of Neglected Tropical
   Diseases
AB Background: Early warning systems (EWS) are management tools to predict the occurrence of epidemics of infectious diseases. While climate-based EWS have been developed for malaria, no standard protocol to evaluate and compare EWS has been proposed. Additionally, there are several neglected tropical diseases whose transmission is sensitive to environmental conditions, for which no EWS have been proposed, though they represent a large burden for the affected populations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present paper, an overview of the available linear and non-linear tools to predict seasonal time series of diseases is presented. Also, a general methodology to compare and evaluate models for prediction is presented and illustrated using American cutaneous leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease, as an example. The comparison of the different models using the predictive R-2 for forecasts of "out-of-fit'' data (data that has not been used to fit the models) shows that for the several linear and non-linear models tested, the best results were obtained for seasonal autoregressive (SAR) models that incorporate climatic covariates. An additional bootstrapping experiment shows that the relationship of the disease time series with the climatic covariates is strong and consistent for the SAR modeling approach. While the autoregressive part of the model is not significant, the exogenous forcing due to climate is always statistically significant. Prediction accuracy can vary from 50% to over 80% for disease burden at time scales of one year or shorter.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study illustrates a protocol for the development of EWS that includes three main steps: (i) the fitting of different models using several methodologies, (ii) the comparison of models based on the predictability of "out-of-fit'' data, and (iii) the assessment of the robustness of the relationship between the disease and the variables in the model selected as best with an objective criterion.

TI Epidemiology and Clinical Features of Patients with Visceral
   Leishmaniasis Treated by an MSF Clinic in Bakool Region, Somalia,
   2004-2006
AB Background: There are few reports describing the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Somalia. Over the years 2002 to 2005, a yearly average of 140 patients were reported from the Huddur centre in Bakool region, whereas in 2006, this number rose to 1002 patients. Given the limited amount of information on VL and the opportunity to compare features with the studies done in 2000 in this part of Somalia, we describe the epidemiologic and clinical features of patients who presented to the Huddur treatment centre of Bakool region, Somalia, using data routinely collected over a five-year observation period (2002-2006).
   Methodology: Methods used included the analysis of routine data on VL cases treated in the Huddur treatment centre, a retrospective study of records of patients admitted between 2004 and 2006, community leaders interviews, and analysis of blood specimens taken for parasite species identification in Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine.
   Principal Findings: A total of 1671 VL patients were admitted to the Huddur centre from January 2002 until December 2006. Nearly all patients presented spontaneously to the health centre. Since 2002, the average patient load was stable, with an average of 140 admissions per year. By the end of 2005, the number of admissions dramatically increased to reach a 7-fold increase in 2006. The genotype of L. donovani identified in 2006 was similar to the one reported in 2002. 82% of total patients treated for VL originated from two districts of Bakool region, Huddur and Tijelow districts. Clinical recovery rate was 93.2% and case fatality rate 3.9%.
   Conclusions: After four years of low but constant VL case findings, a major increase in VL was observed over a 16-month period in the Huddur VL centre. The profile of the patients was pediatric and mortality relatively low. Decentralized treatment centers, targeted active screening, and community sensitization will help decrease morbidity and mortality from VL in this endemic area. The true magnitude of VL in Somalia remains unknown. Further documentation to better understand transmission dynamics and thus define appropriate control measures will depend on the stability of the context and safe access to the Somali population.

TI Neopolyploidy and pathogen resistance
AB Despite the well-documented historical importance of polyploidy, the mechanisms responsible for the establishment and evolutionary success of novel polyploid lineages remain unresolved. One possibility, which has not been previously evaluated theoretically, is that novel polyploid lineages are initially more resistant to pathogens than the diploid progenitor species. Here, we explore this possibility by developing and analysing mathematical models of interactions between newly formed polyploid lineages and their pathogens. We find that for the genetic mechanisms of pathogen resistance with the best empirical support, newly formed polyploid populations of hosts are expected to be more resistant than their diploid progenitors. This effect can be quite strong and, in the case of perennial species with recurrent polyploid formation, may last indefinitely, potentially providing a general explanation for the successful establishment of novel polyploid lineages.

TI Human immunodeficiency virus evolution towards reduced replicative
   fitness in vivo and the development of AIDS
AB Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection progresses to AIDS following an asymptomatic period during which the virus is thought to evolve towards increased fitness and pathogenicity. We show mathematically that progression to the strongest HIV-induced pathology requires evolution of the virus towards reduced replicative fitness in vivo. This counter-intuitive outcome can happen if multiple viruses co-infect the same cell frequently, which has been shown to occur in recent experiments. According to our model, in the absence of frequent co-infection, the less fit AIDS-inducing strains might never emerge. The frequency of co-infection can correlate with virus load, which in turn is determined by immune responses. Thus, at the beginning of infection when immunity is strong and virus load is low, co-infection is rare and pathogenic virus variants with reduced replicative fitness go extinct. At later stages of infection when immunity is less efficient and virus load is higher, co-infection occurs more frequently and pathogenic virus variants with reduced replicative fitness can emerge, resulting in T-cell depletion. In support of these notions, recent data indicate that pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains occurring late in the infection are less fit in specific in vitro experiments than those isolated at earlier stages. If co-infection is blocked, the model predicts the absence of any disease even if virus loads are high. We hypothesize that non-pathogenic SIV infection within its natural hosts, which is characterized by the absence of disease even in the presence of high virus loads, could be explained by a reduced occurrence of co-infection in this system.

TI Parasites lost? An overlooked hypothesis for the evolution of
   alternative reproductive strategies in amphibians
AB Amphibians exhibit the greatest diversity of reproductive strategies of all tetrapod vertebrates. While authors have traditionally attributed the evolution of these strategies to factors such as complex topography, unpredictable larval environments, and predation on larvae and eggs, support for any of these hypotheses has been limited. Importantly, most authors have ignored parasites, including unicellular pathogens and multicellular parasites, as selective agents capable of influencing amphibian evolution. Insights in disease transmission, amphibian immunity, and their interaction with various life histories require that we consider parasites to be selective pressures in our exploration of the evolution of amphibian reproductive strategies. I review recent findings and describe how these principles converge to form a novel conceptual hypothesis for the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies in amphibians. I offer some specific predictions and recommend that parasites be considered with other selective pressures when constructing formal, falsifiable hypotheses during evaluative studies of amphibian reproductive behavior.

TI Predators, parasitoids, and pathogens: A cross-cutting examination of
   intraguild predation theory
AB Although the canonical concept of intraguild predation evokes images of predators and prey, several subdisciplines within ecology have developed theory not specifically framed in terms of predation and competition and often using system-specific terminology, yet functionally quite similar. Here, we formulate models combining exploitation and competition in predator-prey, host-parasitoid, and host-pathogen communities to compare dynamics, food web structure, and coexistence criteria for these disparate communities. Although dynamic stability in the coexistence region varies strongly among systems, in all cases coexistence of two consumers on a single resource occurs only if the intraguild prey species is more efficient than the intraguild predator at suppressing the abundance of the basal resource, and if the intraguild predator accrues a sufficient gain from attacking the intraguild prey. In addition, equilibrial abundances of all species in all three formulations respond similarly to increases in productivity of the basal resource. Our understanding of predator-prey and parasitoid-host communities has bene. fited from explicit examination of intraguild predation ( IGP) theory, and we suggest that future research examining pathogen communities, in particular, will benefit substantially from explicit recognition of predictions from IGP theory.

TI Pandemic influenza and hospital resources
AB Using estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and published models of the expected evolution of pandemic influenza, we modeled the surge capacity of healthcare facility and intensive care unit (ICU) requirements over time in northern Netherlands (approximate to 1.7 million population). We compared the demands of various scenarios with estimates of maximum ICU capacity, factoring in healthcare worker absenteeism as well as reported and realistic estimates derived from semistructured telephone interviews with key management in ICUs in the study area. We show that even during the peak of the pandemic, most patients requiring ICU admission may be served, even those who have non-influenza-related conditions, provided that strong indications and decision-making rules are maintained for admission as well as for continuation (or discontinuation) of life support. Such a model should be integral to a preparedness plan for a pandernic with a new human-transmissible agent.

AB There are no data on the serotypes of rotaviruses prevalent in Kuwait, which has a large expatriate population and hence a focal point for transmission of pathogens. The serotype information will contribute to the fund of knowledge on the world epidemiology of rotavirus serotypes and will predict the outcome of vaccination in Kuwait. Of the 75 rotavirus-positive samples from 172 children (aged <5 years) with severe diarrhoea, 69 were genotyped. The distribution of genotypes was G1 (63.8%) followed by G9 (10.2%), G2 (7.3%), G4 (7.3%) and G3 (4.4%). Among the P types, P[8] was the most common type found across all G types. By fluorescent focus neutralization test, serum antibodies to genotypes G1 (94%), G4 (68%) and G9 (46%) were found in 120 other children. These results show that G1 is the predominant serotype in Kuwait and that a vaccine that contains G1 will be most effective.

TI Host density impacts relative fitness of bacteriophage phi 6 genotypes
   in structured habitats
AB Spatially structured environments may impact evolution by restricting population sizes, limiting opportunities for genetic mixis, or weakening selection against deleterious genotypes. When habitat structure impedes dispersal, low-productivity (less virulent) infectious parasites may benefit from their prudent exploitation of local hosts. Here we explored the combined ability for habitat structure and host density to dictate the relative reproductive success of differentially productive parasites. To do so, we allowed two RNA bacteriophage Phi 6 genotypes to compete in structured and unstructured (semi-solid versus liquid) habitats while manipulating the density of Pseudomonas hosts. In the unstructured habitats, the more-productive phage strain experienced a relatively constant fitness advantage regardless of starting host density. By contrast, in structured habitats, restricted phage dispersal may have magnified the importance of local productivity, thus allowing the relative fitness of the less-productive virus to improve as host density increased. Further data suggested that latent period (duration of cellular infection) and especially burst size (viral progeny produced per cell) were the phage "life-history" traits most responsible for our results. We discuss the relevance of our findings for selection occurring in natural phage populations and for the general evolutionary epidemiology of infectious parasites.

TI Evolution of host specificity drives reproductive isolation among RNA
   viruses
AB Ecological speciation hypotheses claim that assortative mating evolves as a consequence of divergent natural selection for ecologically important traits. Reproductive isolation is expected to be particularly likely to evolve by this mechanism in species such as phytophagous insects that mate in the habitats in which they eat. We tested this expectation by monitoring the evolution of reproductive isolation in laboratory populations of an RNA virus that undergoes genetic exchange only when multiple virus genotypes coinfect the same host. We subjected four populations of the RNA bacteriophage phi 6 to 150 generations of natural selection on a novel host. Although there was no direct selection acting on host range in our experiment, three of the four populations lost the ability to infect one or more alternative hosts. In the most extreme case, one of the populations evolved a host range that does not contain any of the hosts infectible by the wild-type phi 6. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that the resulting reproductive isolation was due to a single nucleotide change, highlighting the ease with which an emerging RNA virus can decouple its evolutionary fate from that of its ancestor. Our results uniquely demonstrate the evolution of reproductive isolation in allopatric experimental populations. Furthermore, our data confirm the biological credibility of simple "no-gene" mechanisms of assortative mating, in which this trait arises as a pleiotropic effect of genes responsible for ecological adaptation.

TI The mixed mating system of Impatiens capensis and infection by a foliar
   rust pathogen: Patterns of resistance and fitness consequences
AB Outcrossing by hosts may offer protection from natural enemies adapted to parental genotypes by creating diverse progeny that differ from their parents through genetic recombination. However, past experimental work addressing the relationship between mating system and disease in offspring has given conflicting results, suggesting that outcrossing might also cause the dissolution of resistant genotypes. To determine if selfed progeny are more susceptible to disease caused by the heteroecious rust, Puccinia recondita, or if selfing preserves existing resistant genotypes, we used a factorial design to compare levels of infection of selfed and outcrossed progeny of Impatiens capensis, a woodland annual with a mixed mating system. We compared the level of host infection when exposed to three pathogen sources in the field: the sympatric rust population, and two allopatric rust populations. Outcrossed progeny exposed to sympatric rust had higher infection scores than selfed progeny exposed to the same rust, suggesting that outcrossing breaks up resistant genotypes. In addition, there was a trend for the rust to be more infective on sympatric rather than allopatric hosts. We also examined whether rust infection differentially alters the fitness of selfed and outcrossed progeny. Outcrossed plants that escaped infection had higher fitness, as measured by fruit production, than selfed plants, but there was no difference in fitness between infected selfed and infected outcrossed plants. Thus, outcrossing was advantageous in the absence of disease, but there was no fitness difference between selfed and outcrossed progeny in the presence of disease. In sum, our results indicate that interactions with pathogens can eliminate or reverse the advantage of outcrossing.

TI Evidence for a cost of immunity when the crustacean Daphnia magna is
   exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa
AB 1. The deployment of the immune system has the obvious potential to ameliorate infection outcomes, but immune responses can also harm hosts by either damaging host tissues or monopolizing resources, leading to enhanced mortality. To gain insight into such a 'cost of immunity' when the crustacean Daphnia magna is challenged with the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa, we measured survivorship among hosts that resisted infection following exposure to various strains and doses of the parasite.
   2. In the first of two experiments, these exposures were: single exposures with relatively non-aggressive strains, double exposures with non-aggressive strains, and exposure to aggressive strains. Mortality increased across this gradient of exposure. In a second experiment, we varied the dose of the most aggressive P. ramosa strain and found that resisting infection when a large dose was applied resulted in greater mortality than when a medium or low dose was applied.
   3. Assuming that resistance is accomplished with an immune response, and that more aggressive parasites and/or larger doses of parasites are more immunostimulatory, these data are compatible with a cost of immunity. Indeed, in terms of survival, resisting parasites can be more harmful than infection.

TI Evidence of an interannual effect of maternal immunization on the immune
   response of juveniles in a long-lived colonial bird
AB 1. Little is known about the maternal transfer of antibodies in natural host-parasite systems despite its possible evolutionary and ecological implications. In domestic animals, the maternal transfer of antibodies can enhance offspring survival via a temporary protection against parasites, but it can also interfere with the juvenile immune response to antigens.
   2. We tested the functional role of maternal antibodies in a natural population of a long-lived colonial seabird, the kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), using a vaccine (Newcastle disease virus vaccine) to mimic parasite exposure combined with a cross-fostering design.
   3. We first investigated the role of prior maternal exposure on the interannual transmission of Ab to juveniles. We then tested the effect of these antibodies on the juvenile immune response to the same antigen.
   4. The results show that specific maternal antibodies were transferred to chicks 1 year after maternal exposure and that these antibodies were functional, i.e. they affected juvenile immunity. These results suggest that the role of maternal antibodies may depend on the timing and pattern of offspring exposure to parasites, along with the patterns of maternal exposure and the dynamics of her immune response.
   5. Overall, our approach underlines that although the transgenerational transfer of antibodies in natural populations is likely to have broad implications, the nature of these effects may vary dramatically among host-parasite systems, depending on the physiological mechanisms involved and the ecological context.

TI Pathogen fitness components and genotypes differ in their sensitivity to
   nutrient and temperature variation in a wild plant-pathogen association
AB Understanding processes maintaining variation in pathogen life-history stages affecting infectivity and reproduction is a key challenge in evolutionary ecology. Models of host-parasite coevolution are based on the assumption that genetic variation for host-parasite interactions is a significant cause of variation in infection, and that variation in environmental conditions does not overwhelm the genetic basis. However, surprisingly little is known about the stability of genotype-genotype interactions under variable environmental conditions. Here, using a naturally occurring plant-pathogen interaction, I tested whether the two distinct aspects of the infection process - infectivity and transmission potential - vary over realistic nutrient and temperature gradients. I show that the initial pathogen infectivity and host resistance responses are robust over the environmental gradients. However, for compatible responses there were striking differences in how different pathogen life-history stages and host and pathogen genotypes responded to environmental variation. For some pathogen genotypes even slight changes in temperature arrested spore production, rendering the developing infection ineffectual. The response of pathogen genotypes to environmental gradients varied in magnitude and even direction, so that their rankings changed across the abiotic gradients. Hence, the variable environment of spatially structured host-parasite interactions may strongly influence the maintenance of polymorphism in pathogen life-history stages governing transmission, whereas evolutionary trajectories of infectivity may be unaffected by the surrounding environment.

TI The anatomy of a malaria disaster: drug policy choice and mortality in
   African children
AB Drug-resistant malaria is a substantial problem throughout Africa and most countries must regularly adapt their antimalarial drug policies to ensure a continued coverage of effective antimalarial treatment. The timing of drug policy change can be guided by several sources of data: molecular markers of resistance, in-vitro parasite sensitivity, parasitological and clinical failure rates, and community morbidity and mortality rates. Through mathematical simulations of the spread of parasite mutations through a population exposed to high-endemic malaria, we explore the causal and chronological relations between these indicators and show which of them are obscured or confounded by other factors. Taking into account the logistical and practical advantages and disadvantages of each type of data collection, we critically appraise the value of each indicator. A major problem is shown to be that drug efficacy as perceived by people at risk will remain high even after drugs have become almost completely ineffective, resulting in a lack of community pressure for drug policy change. We show that parasitological failure is the most sensitive and timely indicator, which allows around 2-3 years for drug policy change to be implemented, so as to prevent the most rapid rise in malaria-related mortality.

TI Rates of evolution of avirulence phenotypes and DNA markers in a
   northwest European population of Puccinia striiformis f. sp tritici
AB The effects of evolutionary processes in fungal pathogen populations may occur more rapidly and display larger effects in agricultural systems than in wild ecosystems because of human involvement by plant breeding and crop management. In this study, we analysed the rate of evolution in three lineages of a northwest European population of a biotrophic and asexual reproduced fungal pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, causing yellow rust on wheat. Pathogen samples were collected between 1975 and 2002 in the UK and Denmark, and assayed for 14 individual avirulence/virulence alleles and up to 234 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer pairs producing approximately 17 000 AFLP fragments. The large number of fragments and a targeted sampling of isolates allowed a reconstruction of phylogenies in great detail, i.e. no homoplasy and a representation of sequential, evolutionary steps by pathogen samples. A recent, phenotypic loss of avirulence was observed at least once for loci corresponding to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici resistance Yr2, Yr3, Yr4, Yr7, Yr9, and Yr15, whereas Avr6 and Avr17 were lost independently in all three lineages, corresponding to 16 events of loss of avirulence (emergence of virulence). The opposite process, restoration of avirulence, was observed for Yr9 and Yr32. An interpretation of phenotypic changes within lineages as independent mutation events resulted in mutation frequencies from 1.4 x 10(-6) to 4.1 x 10(-6) per AFLP fragment (locus) per generation, whereas the effective rate by which a mutation from avirulence to virulence was established in the pathogen population, when subject to selection by host resistance genes, was approximately three orders of magnitude faster.

TI Co-phylogeography and comparative population genetics of the threatened
   Galapagos hawk and three ectoparasite species: ecology shapes population
   histories within parasite communities
AB Comparative microevolutionary studies of multiple parasites occurring on a single host species can help shed light on the processes underlying parasite diversification. We compared the phylogeographical histories, population genetic structures and population divergence times of three co-distributed and phylogenetically independent ectoparasitic insect species, including an amblyceran and an ischnoceran louse (Insecta: Phthiraptera), a hippoboscid fly (Insecta: Diptera) and their endemic avian host in the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos hawk (Aves: Falconiformes: Buteo galapagoensis) is a recently arrived endemic lineage in the Galapagos Islands and its island populations are diverging evolutionarily. Each parasite species differed in relative dispersal ability and distribution within the host populations, which allowed us to make predictions about their degree of population genetic structure and whether they tracked host gene flow and colonization history among islands. To control for DNA region in comparisons across these phylogenetically distant taxa, we sequenced similar to 1 kb of homologous mitochondrial DNA from samples collected from all island populations of the host. Remarkably, the host was invariant across mitochondrial regions that were comparatively variable in each of the parasite species, to degrees consistent with differences in their natural histories. Differences in these natural history traits were predictably correlated with the evolutionary trajectories of each parasite species, including rates of interisland gene flow and tracking of hosts by parasites. Congruence between the population structures of the ischnoceran louse and the host suggests that the ischnoceran may yield insight into the cryptic evolutionary history of its endangered host, potentially aiding in its conservation management.

TI Disentangling hybridization and host colonization in parasitic
   roundworms of humans and pigs
AB Knowledge of cross-transmission and hybridization between parasites of humans and reservoir hosts is critical for understanding the evolution of the parasite and for implementing control programmes. There is now a consensus that populations of pig and human Ascaris ( roundworms) show significant genetic subdivision. However, it is unclear whether this has resulted from a single or multiple host shift( s). Furthermore, previous molecular data have not been sufficient to determine whether sympatric populations of human and pig Ascaris can exchange genes. To disentangle patterns of host colonization and hybridization, we used 23 microsatellite loci to conduct Bayesian clustering analyses of individual worms collected from pigs and humans. We observed strong differentiation between populations which was primarily driven by geography, with secondary differentiation resulting from host affiliation within locations. This pattern is consistent with multiple host colonization events. However, there is low support for the short internal branches of the dendrograms. In part, the relationships among clusters may result from current hybridization among sympatric human and pig roundworms. Indeed, congruence in three Bayesian methods indicated that 4 and 7% of roundworms sampled from Guatemala and China, respectively, were hybrids. These results indicate that there is contemporary cross-transmission between populations of human and pig Ascaris.

TI Seroprevalence of measles antibody in the US population, 1999-2004
AB Background. Endemic measles transmission was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. To ensure that elimination can be maintained, high population immunity must be sustained and monitored. Testing for measles antibody was included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative survey, conducted during 1999-2004.
   Methods. A measles-specific immunoassay was used to measure the seroprevalence of measles antibody in NHANES participants 6-49 years of age. For analysis, participants were grouped by birth cohort.
   Results. During 1999-2004, the rate of measles seropositivity in the population overall was 95.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.1%-96.5%). The highest seroprevalence of measles antibody was in non-Hispanic blacks (98.6% [95% CI, 98.0%-99.1%]). Those born during 1967-1976 had significantly lower levels of measles antibody (92.4% [95% CI, 90.8%-93.9%]) than did the other birth cohorts. Independent predictors of measles seropositivity in the 1967-1976 birth cohort were non-Hispanic/black race/ethnicity, more than a high school education, having health insurance, and birth outside the United States.
   Conclusions. Measles seropositivity was uniformly high in the US population during 1999-2004. Nearly all population subgroups had evidence of measles seropositivity levels greater than the estimated threshold necessary to sustain measles elimination. Non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans born during 1967-1976 had the lowest measles seropositivity levels and represent populations that might be at increased risk for measles disease if the virus were reintroduced into the United States.

TI Spatial and temporal patterns of Zaire ebolavirus antibody prevalence in
   the possible reservoir bat species
AB To characterize the distribution of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) infection within the 3 bat species (Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus, and Myonycteris torquata) that are possible reservoirs, we collected 1390 bats during 2003-2006 in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo. Detection of ZEBOV immunoglobulin G (IgG) in 40 specimens supports the role of these bat species as the ZEBOV reservoirs. ZEBOV IgG prevalence rates (5%) were homogeneous across epidemic and nonepidemic regions during outbreaks, indicating that infected bats may well be present in nonepidemic regions of central Africa. ZEBOV IgG prevalence decreased, significantly, to 1% after the outbreaks, suggesting that the percentage of IgG-positive bats is associated with virus transmission to other animal species and outbreak appearance. The large number of ZEBOV IgG-positive adult bats and pregnant H. monstrosus females suggests virus transmission within bat populations through fighting and sexual contact. Our study, thus, helps to describe Ebola virus circulation in bats and offers some insight into the appearance of outbreaks.

TI Analysis of filovirus entry into Vero E6 cells, using inhibitors of
   endocytosis, endosomal acidification, structural integrity, and

AB Ebola and Marburg viruses are believed to enter host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The process has been studied through the use of inhibitors that affect host cell properties and recombinant pseudotyping systems in which filovirus structural glycoproteins mediate entry of foreign virus particles. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of such treatments on the entry of wild-type filoviruses. Vero E6 cells were exposed to various inhibitors before, during, and after infection with filoviruses. Infected cultures were harvested early (18-24 h) and late (72 h) after infection, and effects of treatment on entry were measured by fluorescent antibody staining of cells or by antigen capture immunoassays, respectively. These prelimary results suggest that filoviruses enter host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits and caveolae, that actin filaments and microtubules are important in the entry process, and that proteolytic digestion of glycoprotein 1 by endosomal proteases facilitates entry. These observations obtained using wildtype viruses confirm the results of studies utilizing recombinant systems and offer additional insights into filovirus entry.

TI Filovirus-like particles produced in insect cells: Immunogenicity and
   protection in rodents
AB Background. Virus-like particles (VLPs) of Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) produced in human 293T embryonic kidney cells have been shown to be effective vaccines against filoviral infection. In this study, we explored alternative strategies for production of filovirus-like particle-based vaccines, to accelerate the development process. The goal of this work was to increase the yield of VLPs, while retaining their immunogenic properties.
   Methods. Ebola and Marburg VLPs (eVLPs and mVLPs, respectively) were generated by use of recombinant baculovirus constructs expressing glycoprotein, VP40 matrix protein, and nucleoprotein from coinfected insect cells. The baculovirus-derived eVLPs and mVLPs were characterized biochemically, and then the immune responses produced by the eVLPs in insect cells were studied further.
   Results. The baculovirus-derived eVLPs elicited maturation of human myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), indicating their immunogenic properties. Mice vaccinated with insect cell-derived eVLPs generated antibody and cellular responses equivalent to those vaccinated with mammalian 293T cell-derived eVLPs and were protected from EBOV challenge in a dose-dependent manner.
   Conclusion. Together, these data suggest that filovirus-like particles produced by baculovirus expression systems, which are amenable to large-scale production, are highly immunogenic and are suitable as safe and effective vaccines for the prevention of filoviral infection.

Current recording, transmittal, analysis, feedback, and use of malaria surveillance information is delayed and imprecise: substantially < 10% of the malaria cases and deaths are being reported. Improvements are occurring, but more emphasis should be placed on prompt, accurate diagnosis, patient management. and recording of clinical manifestations at hospitals. Neurologic signs, severe anemia, metabolic changes. hyperparasitemia, and concurrent sepsis are medical emergencies and require proper clinical and laboratory detection: equipment, reagents, supervision, and certification of laboratorians and clinicians are necessary. Birth weight should also be a major measure of progress in malarial control and overall prenatal care. Although malaria is the most frequent diagnosis at outpatient clinics and hospitals in Africa, co-existing conditions also mandate improved diagnosis, treatment. and registration. Monthly transmittal of information from health units and collation, analysis and feedback through electronic reporting systems using modern information technologies are necessary for resource planning and staff motivation. Denominators to compute rates of illness and death require accurate censuses of communities from which patients come to health units: specialized disease and demographic household surveys designed and performed by nationals are needed to complement hospital-based numerator data. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax should be distinguished in the laboratory; the former causes the greatest mortality but the latter is increasingly recognized as a major peril. Because vector control is now a major component of all malaria control programs, there is an urgent need to monitor anopheline sensitivity to insecticides and entomologic inoculation rates. Where interrupting transmission is a goal, parasite rates in groups at greatest risk should be performed. Continual monitoring of plasmodial sensitivity to drugs is necessary using WHO protocols. Human, entomological, and parasitological surveillance must be performed at the came time in the same places and the information shared widely and used for improving control strategies and tactics. These surveillance priorities require training, provision of equipment, supervision, and commitment to sustainability by national authorities and international collaborators and donors.

TI New interventions for malaria: Mining the human and parasite Genomes
AB Malaria has been the greatest scourge of humankind for many millennia, and as a consequence has had more impact than any other pathogen in shaping the human genome. The sequencing of the human genome provides a new opportunity to determine the genetic traits that confer resistance to infection or disease. The identification of these traits can reveal immune responses, or host-parasite interactions, which may be useful for designing vaccines or new drugs. Similarly, the parasite genome sequence is being exploited to accelerate the development of new antimalarial interventions, for example by identifying parasite metabolic pathways that may be targeted by drugs. The malaria parasites are well known for their ability to undergo antigenic variation, and in parallel to cause a diverse array of disease syndromes, including the severe syndromes that commonly cause death. Genome-based technologies are being harnessed to relate gene and protein expression levels, or genetic variation, to the parasite forms that are targets of protective immunity. Well-conducted clinical studies are required to relate host or parasite diversity with disease. However. genomics studies of human populations raise important ethical issues, such as the disposition of data related to disease susceptibility or paternity, and the ability of communities to understand the nature of the research.

AB The present study examined the genetic diversity and population structure of Plasmodium falciparum in western Kenya by analyzing the polymorphism of 12 microsatellite loci and two antigen loci. Malaria in highland areas is unstable and epidemic whereas malaria in lowland areas is endemic. Transmission intensity and malaria prevalence are substantially lower in the highlands than in the lowlands. Despite that the highland parasite populations exhibited reduced number of alleles, lower expected heterozygosity, and infection complexity in comparison to the surrounding lowland population, genetic diversity of the highland populations remained high in comparison to parasites from other meso-endemic regions. More than 70% of infections from western Kenya highland study sites were mixed genotype infections. Small but statistically significant genetic differentiation between highland and lowland populations was detected. These findings are discussed in the context of human travel and local transmission in the study area.

TI Within-host disease ecology in the sea fan Gorgonia ventalina: Modeling
   the spatial immunodynamics of a coral-pathogen interaction
AB We develop a spatially explicit model for the within-host interactions between a fungal pathogen and the immune response by its coral host. The model is parameterized for the recent epizootic of Aspergillus sydowii in the sea fan Gorgonia ventalina, but its structure is adaptable to many other diseases attacking corals worldwide, fungal infections in other invertebrates and plants, and opportunistic fungal infections in vertebrates. Model processes include pathogen growth and spread through consumption of host tissue, chemotactic attraction of undifferentiated host amoebocytes to infections, and amoebocyte differentiation into various cell types that attack the pathogen. Sensitivity analysis shows that the spread rate of a single localized infection is determined primarily by the pathogen's potential rate of host tissue consumption and by the host's ability to replenish the pool of undifferentiated amoebocytes and sustain a long-term response. The spatial localization of immune responses creates potentially strong indirect interactions between distant lesions, allowing new infections to grow rapidly while host resources are concentrated at older, larger infections. These findings provide possible mechanistic explanations for effects of environmental stressors (e. g., ocean warming, nutrient enrichment) on aspergillosis prevalence and severity and for the observed high spatial and between-host variability in disease impacts.

   lowland leopard frogs Rana yavapaiensis in Arizona
AB Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a fungus that can potentially lead to chytridiomycosis, an amphibian disease implicated in die-offs and population declines in many regions of the world. Winter field surveys in the last decade have documented die-offs in populations of the lowland leopard frog Rana yavapaiensis with chytridiomycosis. To test whether the fungus persists in host populations between episodes of observed host mortality, we quantified field-based Bd infection rates during nonwinter months. We used PCR to sample for the presence of Bd in live individuals from nine seemingly healthy populations of the lowland leopard frog as well as four of the American bullfrog R. catesbeiana (a putative vector for Bd) from Arizona. We found Bd in 10 of 13 sampled populations. The overall prevalence of Bd was 43% in lowland leopard frogs and 18% in American bullfrogs. Our results suggest that Bd is widespread in Arizona during nonwinter months and may become virulent only in winter in conjunction with other cofactors, or is now benign in these species. The absence of Bd from two populations associated with thermal springs (water > 30 degrees C), despite its presence in nearby ambient waters, suggests that these microhabitats represent refugia from Bd and chytridiomycosis.

TI Interannual dynamics of antibody levels in naturally infected long-lived
   colonial birds
AB Little is known about the long-term persistence of specific antibodies ( Ab) in natural host-parasite systems despite its potential epidemiological and ecological importance. In long-lived species, knowledge of the dynamics of individual immunological profiles can be important not only for interpreting serology results, but also for assessing transmission dynamics and the potential selective pressures acting on parasites. The aim of this paper was to investigate temporal variation in levels of specific Ab against the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in adults of a long-lived colonial seabird, the Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla. In wild populations, adults are naturally exposed each breeding season to a Borrelia vector, the tick Ixodes uriae. Breeding birds were captured during four consecutive breeding seasons, and parasite infestation quantified. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblots, we found that the immunological profiles of anti-Borrelia Ab were highly repeatable among years, reflecting the interannual persistence of Ab levels. We nevertheless also observed that year-to-year changes of Ab levels were related to exposure to ticks in the previous year. The long-term persistence of Ab levels may be an important mechanism of individual protection against future exposure to the microparasite. It will also affect the availability of susceptible hosts, and thus the transmission dynamics of the bacterium. These results illustrate the need to consider the dynamics of the immune response in order to better understand the evolutionary ecology of host-parasite interactions in natural populations.

AB Using historical data, we highlight the consequences of anthropogenic ecosystem modifications on the abundance of mosquitoes implicated as the current most important potential malaria vector, Anopheles hyrcanus, and the most important West Nile virus (WNV) vector, Culex modestus, in the Camargue region, France. From World War 11 to 1971, populations of these species increased as rice cultivation expanded in the region in a political context that supported agriculture. They then fell, likely because of decreased cultivation and increased pesticide use to control a rice pest. The species increased again after 2000 with the advent of more targeted pest-management strategies, mainly the results of European regulations decisions. An intertwined influence of political context, environmental constraints, technical improvements, and social factors led to changes in mosquito abundance that had potential consequences on malaria and WNV transmission. These findings suggest that anthropogenic changes should not be underestimated in vectorborne disease recrudescence.

   oak Quercus robur
AB 1. The spatial population structure of parasites may have profound effects on both ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Strong gene flow among local populations has been hypothesized to prevent differential performance on local and foreign hosts.
   2. We studied the spatial population structure of an obligate pathogen, the oak mildew (Microsphaera alphitoides) on the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Patterns of distribution and colonization-extinction dynamics were recorded in a set of 113 trees over 3 years, and in an additional set of 77 trees over 2 years. Colonization of uninfected hosts was examined in a set of 100 experimentally transplanted hosts, and differential performance on local and foreign hosts tested by reciprocal inoculations conducted in the laboratory.
   3. Across years, the mildew occupied a high proportion of host trees ( >= 2/3). Patterns of mildew infection showed either no spatial aggregation (years 2003, 2005), or aggregation at a large spatial scale (up to 400 m; year 2004). High and even incidence of infection reflects efficient dispersal: during a single year, transplanted uninfected host plants were rapidly colonized in all parts of the landscape.
   4. Local mildew populations still performed best on their original hosts: in reciprocal inoculations conducted on mature foliage, local mildew populations infected a significantly higher proportion of leaves from their original host tree than from other trees. Yet, even on the local host less than half of the leaves were infected.
   5. To account for the observed patterns, two selection processes are invoked. The colonization experiment suggests that mildew spores are spread widely, with selection filtering out the genotypes that cannot infect the focal host. Local mildew populations are subject to further selection events later in the summer, favouring the strains best adapted to phenological changes in the local environment.
   6. In conclusion, the patterns observed and processes inferred in M. alphitoides suggest that complex selection pressures may affect local parasite populations, blurring any clear-cut relation between gene flow and performance on local and foreign hosts.

Virally vectored immunocontraception (VVIC) has been proposed as an economic way to achieve this. However, the ability of an immunocontraceptive virus to control populations may be compromised if: (i) sufficient infected mice are not made infertile; (ii) the virus does not transmit at a sufficient rate; (iii) there is competition with field strains of virus; or (iv) its ability to induce infertility is altered by the presence of field strains. We tested this with stochastic, individual-based, disease-host models based on murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and house mice Mus musculus domesticus.
   Using field estimates of the MCMV transmission rate, immunocontraceptive MCMV (icMCMV) could prevent mouse populations from growing rapidly to damaging levels provided > 70% of mice infected with the virus became infertile. Successful control was possible even if engineering icMCMV reduced its transmission rate to c. 30% of the field-estimated value, but greater reductions in the transmission rate compromised successful control.
   Effective control was compromised if there was competition between icMCMV and field strains because of cross-immunity to infection or if previous infection with field strains blocked the development of infertility in mice subsequently infected with icMCMV. In these cases effectiveness was diminished, particularly if the transmission rate of icMCMV was reduced relative to field strains, or if close to 100% infertility of infected mice could not be achieved. If the blocking developed early after infection with field strains, doubling the transmission rate of icMCMV relative to field strains still could not produce successful control.
   Synthesis and applications. VVIC requires preliminary estimates of its efficacy to satisfy regulatory requirements before it can be released into the environment. Our models indicate that successful control of an outbreaking species using VVIC is possible if high levels of infertility can be achieved, but this is compromised by cross-strain protection and low transmission rates of engineered virus. Future research effort should focus on determining whether these compromising effects occur for specific engineered viruses and, if so, whether they can be overcome.

TI Seasonal carriage of pfcrt and pfmdr1 alleles in Gambian Plasmodium
   falciparum imply reduced fitness of chloroquine-resistant parasites
AB Background. Observations in natural Plasmodium falciparum populations after removal of failing drugs suggest that there is a fitness cost of drug resistance.
   Methods. To examine the effect of transient removal of drug pressure, we analyzed seasonal changes in the prevalence of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant parasite genotypes in The Gambia. Parasite isolates from 441 children presenting with uncomplicated falciparum malaria over 5 seasons (1998-2002) were linked to weekly rainfall data.
   Results. The prevalence of CQ-resistant parasites increased slightly over 5 years, with the 76T allele of pfcrt (odds ratio [OR] per year, 1.16; P = .03) and the 86Y allele of pfmdr1 (OR per year, 1.18; P = .02) becoming significantly more common. However, intraseasonal analysis showed that these alleles decreased in prevalence each dry season. Wild-type parasites with respect to both loci predominated as transmission began each year, with resistant parasites becoming more common as drug use increased. This pattern was seen for both pfcrt-76T (OR per week, 1.09; P = .001) and pfmdr1-86Y (OR per week, 1.07; P = .001) and could not be explained by seasonal changes in the clonal complexity of infections.
   Conclusions. The fitness cost of CQ resistance works against the persistence of resistant parasites through the dry season.

TI Detection of acute and established HIV infections in sexually
   transmitted disease clinics in Guangxi, China: Implications for
   screening and prevention of HIV infection
AB Background. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has spread throughout China and to some degree has penetrated the general heterosexual population in some regions.
   Methods. A cross-sectional survey of 11,461 sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attendees in 8 cities in Guangxi, China, was conducted for syphilis and for acute and established HIV infections.
   Results. The prevalence of acute and established HIV infections was 1.2% among the participants. Five acute (preseroconversion) HIV infections were detected. Multivariate analysis showed that HIV infection was independently related to unmarried status (odds ratio [OR], 1.73 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.00-2.99), less education (OR for less than primary school, 4.21 [90% CI, 1.21-14.58]), residence in city A (OR, 11.48 [95% CI, 2.05-64.31]) or city B (OR, 7.93 [95% CI, 1.75-35.91]), working in the entertainment industry (OR, 3.98 [95% CI, 1.14-13.88]), injection drug use (OR, 25.09 [95% CI, 10.43-60.39]), no condom use during most recent sexual intercourse (OR, 4.97 [95% CI, 1.38-17.88]), and syphilitic infection (OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.03-3.56]).
   Conclusions. HIV prevalence in STD clinics is significantly greater than that in the general population, and subjects were identified who would be missed by conventional surveillance. China's nationwide system of public STD clinics, which reach down to the township level, should be used for HIV control programs.

TI Transmission of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 within
   flocks during the 2004 epidemic in Thailand
AB This present study is the first to quantify the transmission of avian influenza virus H5N1 within flocks during the 2004 epidemic in Thailand. It uses the flock-level mortality data to estimate the transmission-rate parameter (beta) and the basic reproduction number (R-0). The point estimates of beta varied from 2.26/ day (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.01-2.55) for a 1-day infectious period to 0.66/ day (95% CI, 0.50-0.87) for a 4-day infectious period, whereas the accompanying R-0 varied from 2.26(95% CI, 2.01-2.55) to 2.64(95% CI, 2.02-3.47). Although the point estimates of beta of backyard chickens and fighting cocks raised together were lower than those of laying hens and broiler chickens, this difference was not statistically significant. These results will enable us to assess the control measures in simulation studies. They also indicate that, for the elimination of the virus, a critical proportion of the susceptible poultry population in a flock (i.e., 80% of the population) needs to be vaccinated.

TI Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis:
   Implications for the HIV epidemic and antiretroviral therapy rollout in
   South Africa
AB Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is emerging as a major clinical and public health challenge in areas of sub-Saharan Africa where there is a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. TB drug-resistance surveillance in this region has been limited by laboratory capacity and the public health infrastructure; however, with the maturation of the HIV epidemic, the burden of drug-resistant TB is increasing rapidly. The recent discovery of large numbers of cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in South Africa likely represents an unrecognized and evolving epidemic rather than sporadic, localized outbreaks. The combination of a large population of HIV-infected susceptible hosts with poor TB treatment success rates, a lack of airborne infection control, limited drug-resistance testing, and an overburdened MDR-TB treatment program provides ideal conditions for an MDR-TB and XDR-TB epidemic of unparalleled magnitude. In the present article, we review the history of drug-resistant TB in South Africa, describe its interaction with the HIV epidemic and the resultant consequences, and suggest measures necessary for controlling MDR-TB and XDR-TB in this context. A successful response to the emergence of MDR-TB and XDR-TB will necessitate increased resources for and collaboration between TB and HIV programs.

TI Density-related changes in selection pattern for major
   histocompatibility complex genes in fluctuating populations of voles
AB Host-pathogen interactions are of particular interest in studies of the interplay between population dynamics and natural selection. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes of demographically fluctuating species are highly suitable markers for such studies, because they are involved in initiating the immune response against pathogens and display a high level of adaptive genetic variation. We investigated whether two MHC class II genes (DQA1, DRB) were subjected to contemporary selection during increases in the density of fossorial water vole (Arvicola terrestris) populations, by comparing the neutral genetic structure of seven populations with that estimated from MHC genes. Tests for heterozygosity excess indicated that DQA1 was subject to intense balancing selection. No such selection operated on neutral markers. This pattern of selection became more marked with increasing abundance. In the low-abundance phase, when populations were geographically isolated, both overall differentiation and isolation-by-distance were more marked for MHC genes than for neutral markers. Model-based simulations identified DQA1 as an outlier (i.e. under selection) in a single population, suggesting the action of local selection in fragmented populations. The differences between MHC and neutral markers gradually disappeared with increasing effective migration between sites. In the high-abundance year, DQA1 displayed significantly lower levels of overall differentiation than the neutral markers. This gene therefore displayed stronger homogenization than observed under drift and migration alone. The observed signs of selection were much weaker for DRB. Spatial and temporal fluctuations in parasite pressure and locus-specific selection are probably the most plausible mechanisms underlying the observed changes in selection pattern during the demographic cycle.

TI How many symbionts are provided by mothers, acquired by offspring, and
   needed for successful vertical transmission in an obligate
   insect-bacterium mutualism?
AB Vertical symbiont transmission is among the most pivotal processes for maintenance of symbiotic associations. However, it is poorly understood whether and how the levels of resource allocation and investment upon vertical transmission are regulated. The stinkbug Megacopta punctatissima is obligatorily associated with the gut symbiotic bacterium 'Candidatus Ishikawaella capsulata', whose transmission is mediated by a unique mechanism called 'symbiont capsule'. We investigated the population dynamics of the symbiont during vertical transmission in the host-symbiont mutualism. The stinkbug mothers produced one capsule for around 3.6 eggs irrespective of clutch size, suggesting a strict maternal control over symbiont supply for the offspring. However, experimental manipulation of egg/capsule ratios revealed that one capsule is sufficient for symbiont transmission to six nymphs. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that a capsule contains 1.2 x 10(8) symbionts, a newborn nymph possesses 2 x 10(7) symbionts from a capsule, and thus one capsule certainly contains a sufficient amount of symbiont cells for six nymphs. These results indicated that the stinkbug mothers produce 1.7 times more symbiont capsules than needed. The newborn nymphs consistently harboured around 2 x 10(7) symbionts, also suggesting a nymphal control over symbiont transmission. The threshold symbiont titre minimally needed for successful vertical transmission was estimated to be 1.9 x 10(6) symbionts, which is only 1/10 of the actual symbiont titre detected in a newborn nymph. These results illuminate several ecological factors that may be relevant to parental and offspring controls over symbiotic resource allocation through host insect generations.

TI Neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in influenza: Assessing the danger of
   its generation and spread
AB Neuraminidase Inhibitors ( NI) are currently the most effective drugs against influenza. Recent cases of NI resistance are a cause for concern. To assess the danger of NI resistance, a number of studies have reported the fraction of treated patients from which resistant strains could be isolated. Unfortunately, those results strongly depend on the details of the experimental protocol. Additionally, knowing the fraction of patients harboring resistance is not too useful by itself. Instead, we want to know how likely it is that an infected patient can generate a resistant infection in a secondary host, and how likely it is that the resistant strain subsequently spreads. While estimates for these parameters can often be obtained from epidemiological data, such data is lacking for NI resistance in influenza. Here, we use an approach that does not rely on epidemiological data. Instead, we combine data from influenza infections of human volunteers with a mathematical framework that allows estimation of the parameters that govern the initial generation and subsequent spread of resistance. We show how these parameters are influenced by changes in drug efficacy, timing of treatment, fitness of the resistant strain, and details of virus and immune system dynamics. Our study provides estimates for parameters that can be directly used in mathematical and computational models to study how NI usage might lead to the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. We find that the initial generation of resistant cases is most likely lower than the fraction of resistant cases reported. However, we also show that the results depend strongly on the details of the within-host dynamics of influenza infections, and most importantly, the role the immune system plays. Better knowledge of the quantitative dynamics of the immune response during influenza infections will be crucial to further improve the results.

TI Pediatric Measles Vaccine Expressing a Dengue Antigen Induces Durable
   Serotype-specific Neutralizing Antibodies to Dengue Virus
AB Dengue disease is an increasing global health problem that threatens one-third of the world's population. Despite decades of efforts, no licensed vaccine against dengue is available. With the aim to develop an affordable vaccine that could be used in young populations living in tropical areas, we evaluated a new strategy based on the expression of a minimal dengue antigen by a vector derived from pediatric live-attenuated Schwarz measles vaccine (MV). As a proof-of-concept, we inserted into the MV vector a sequence encoding a minimal combined dengue antigen composed of the envelope domain III (EDIII) fused to the ectodomain of the membrane protein (ectoM) from DV serotype-1. Immunization of mice susceptible to MV resulted in a long-term production of DV1 serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. The presence of ectoM was critical to the immunogenicity of inserted EDIII. The adjuvant capacity of ectoM correlated with its ability to promote the maturation of dendritic cells and the secretion of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines and chemokines involved in adaptive immunity. The protective efficacy of this vaccine should be studied in non-human primates. A combined measles dengue vaccine might provide a one-shot approach to immunize children against both diseases where they co-exist.

TI Targeted Screening Strategies to Detect Trypanosoma cruzi Infection in
   Children
AB Background: Millions of people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease in Latin America. Anti-trypanosomal drug therapy can cure infected individuals, but treatment efficacy is highest early in infection. Vector control campaigns disrupt transmission of T. cruzi, but without timely diagnosis, children infected prior to vector control often miss the window of opportunity for effective chemotherapy.
   Methods and Findings: We performed a serological survey in children 2-18 years old living in a peri-urban community of Arequipa, Peru, and linked the results to entomologic, spatial and census data gathered during a vector control campaign. 23 of 433 (5.3% [95% Cl 3.4-7.9]) children were confirmed seropositive for T. cruzi infection by two methods. Spatial analysis revealed that households with infected children were very tightly clustered within looser clusters of households with parasite-infected vectors. Bayesian hierarchical mixed models, which controlled for clustering of infection, showed that a child's risk of being seropositive increased by 20% per year of age and 4% per vector captured within the child's house. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots of best-fit models suggest that more than 83% of infected children could be identified while testing only 22% of eligible children.
   Conclusions: We found evidence of spatially-focal vector-borne T. cruzi transmission in peri-urban Arequipa. Ongoing vector control campaigns, in addition to preventing further parasite transmission, facilitate the collection of data essential to identifying children at high risk of T. cruzi infection. Targeted screening strategies could make integration of diagnosis and treatment of children into Chagas disease control programs feasible in lower-resource settings.

TI West Nile viremic blood donors and risk factors for subsequent West Nile
   fever
AB Background: While increasing age is a known risk factor for neuroinvasive West Nile virus (WNV) disease, little is known about risk factors for West Nile fever (WNF). In 2003, United States blood centers identified WN (West Nile) viremic donors using nucleic acid-amplification tests (NATs), making it possible to prospectively determine risk factors for WNF. We report the characteristics of WN viremia among donors at Colorado's largest blood center and risk factors for WNF in viremic donors.
   Methods: Prospective public health surveillance was conducted in WN viremic donors. NAT-reactive donors who developed WNV-specific IgM antibody were considered viremic donors. Demographic data were abstracted from blood center records for all viremic donors aged >= 18 years. Standardized telephone questionnaires were administered a median of 39 days following donation. Donors reporting fever and headache within seven days following donation were considered West Nile fever (WNF) cases.
   Results: Of 66,771 donations screened from July 1-October 31, 146 (0.22%) were from viremic donors (1:457 donations). Of 135 surveyed donors, 81 (60%) were male. The median age was 49 years (range: 18-78). Forty-one (30%) donors developed WNF; of these, 12 (29%) visited a physician. Other reported symptoms included body aches (98%), eye pain (63%), and skin rash (61%). The risk of WNF was inversely correlated with age (odds ratio: 0.95 for every 1-year increase in age; 95% CI 0.91, 0.99; p = 0.008).
   Conclusions: WN viremia was frequently identified in Colorado blood donors during the 2003 WNV epidemic. The high frequency of WNF and subsequent physician visits among healthy blood donors suggest substantial morbidity from WNF in the general population. The inverse correlation between age and WNF is a new finding and its pathophysiology is unknown.

TI Operational trials of remote mosquito trap systems for Japanese
   encephalitis virus surveillance in the Torres Strait, Australia
AB Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) appears nearly annually in the Torres Strait in far northern Queensland, Australia, and is a threat to invade the Australian mainland. Surveillance has involved the use of sentinel pigs that develop detectable viremias and antibody titers to JEV. However, pigs are amplifying hosts for JEV, and thus pose a health risk to the public and to pig handlers who bleed the pigs. A remote mosquito trap system would not have these risks. We report on trials using a remote mosquito trap system for the surveillance of JEV in the Torres Strait. The Mosquito Magnet (MM) Pro (R), MM Liberty Plus (R), and a novel updraft trap, the NAQS Mozzie Trap, were run at Badu and Moa islands in the Torres Strait and at Bamaga in the northern Cape York Peninsula from 2002-2005. TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect JEV nucleic acid in weekly mosquito collections. Sentinel pigs located at Badu were also bled and the serum processed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR for JEV antigen and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-JEV antibodies. JEV was detected in mosquito collections each year but not in each trap. No JEV was detected in trapped mosquitoes before detection in sentinel pigs. The mosquito trap system cost ca. AU$10,000 per site, about AU$5,000 less than a pig-based system. However, trap failures caused by mosquito-clogged motors, electrical faults, and blocked gas lines reduced the efficacy of some mosquito traps. Nonetheless, a remote mosquito trap system, employing stand alone traps and PCR for viral antigen detection, can be a safe, economical way to detect arbovirus activity in remote areas.

TI Habitat factors influencing distributions of Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   and Ehrlichia chaffeensis in the Mississippi alluvial valley
AB Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME), caused by the bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum, are two emerging tick-borne zoonoses of concern. Factors influencing geographic distributions of these pathogens are not fully understood, especially at varying spatial extents (regional versus landscape) and resolutions (counties versus smaller land units). We used logistic regression to compare influences of physical environment, land cover composition, and landscape heterogeneity on distributions of A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis at multiple spatial extents. Pathogen presence or absence was determined from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) serum samples collected from 1981 to 2005. Ecological predictor variables were derived from spatial datasets that represented deer density, elevation, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), hydrology, and soil moisture. We used three strategies (a priori, exploratory, and spatial extent) to develop models. Best fitting models were applied within a geographic information system to create predictive probability surfaces for each bacterium. Ecological predictor variables generally resulted in better fitting models for E. chaffeensis than A. phagocytophilum (90.5% and 68% sensitivity, respectively), possibly as a result of differences in the natural histories of tick vectors. Although alternative model development strategies produced different models, in all cases bacteria presence or absence was affected by a combination of soil moisture or flooding variables (thought to affect primarily tick vectors) and forest cover or NDVI variables (thought to affect primarily mammalian hosts). This research demonstrates the potential for modeling the distributions of microscopic tick-borne pathogens using coarse regional datasets and emphasizes the importance of forest cover and flooding as environmental constraints, as well as the importance of considering ecological variables at multiple spatial extents.

   competence of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus say (Diptera : Culicidae)
   for West Nile virus
AB Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say mosquitoes from a laboratory colony were exposed to artificial blood meals containing West Nile virus (WNV) and held at incubation temperatures approximating average daily temperatures that occur during Florida arboviral periods. Mosquitoes fed blood meals containing 6.2 logs plaque-forming units (pfu) WNV/mL and held at 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, or 30 degrees C for 13 days exhibited significantly different rates of infection (30%, 52%, 93%) and dissemination (33%, 22%, 81%) across temperatures. In a separate experiment, Cx. p. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were provided artificial blood meals with graded doses of WNV from 3.7 to 5.8 logs pfu/mL and maintained at 28 degrees C for 13 days. Rates of infection increased as a function of virus dose, but neither body titers nor dissemination rates were significantly different for mosquitoes that were infected by ingesting different amounts of WNV. Our findings indicate that efficiency of WNV infection and dissemination, and thereby transmission, in Cx. p. quinquefasciatus populations similar to our tested colony may also be diminished when fed blood meals containing less than 5.8 logs pfu WNV/mL and when environmental temperature falls below 30 degrees C. The relationship between the infection rate and dissemination rate changed at different temperatures. This relationship is likely complex and dependent on diverse interactions between factors such as incubation temperature and viremia, which should also be assessed for field populations.

AB Background. Heterosexual anal and oral sex are related to the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus infection. We examined the correlates of heterosexual anal and oral sex in the general population, using data from the National Survey of Family Growth.
   Methods. The sample included 12,571 men and women aged 15-44 years (79% response rate).
   Results. One-third of men and women had ever had anal sex, and three-quarters had ever had oral sex. Condom use during last oral or anal sex was relatively uncommon. In separate models for men and women, having ever had anal sex was associated with white race, age of 20-44 years, and having had a nonmonogamous sex partner. White race, age of 20-44 years, being married, and having higher numbers of lifetime sex partners were related to having ever given oral sex in men and women. Giving oral sex was associated with having a nonmonogamous sex partner in men. Ever receiving oral sex was associated with white race and a nonmonogamous sex partner in men and women.
   Conclusions. It would be beneficial to track the prevalence of heterosexual anal and oral sex and associated condom use on a more frequent basis.

TI Ant semiochemicals limit apterous aphid dispersal
AB Some organisms can manipulate the nervous systems of others or alter their physiology in order to obtain benefit. Ants are known to limit alate aphid dispersal by physically removing wings and also through chemical manipulation of the alate developmental pathway. This results in reduced dispersal and higher local densities of aphids, which benefit ants in terms of increased honeydew and prey availability. Here, we show that the walking movement of mutualistic apterous aphids is also reduced by ant semiochemicals. Aphids walk slower and their dispersal from an unsuitable patch is hampered by ants. If aphid walking dispersal has evolved as a means of natural enemy escape, then ant chemicals may act as a signal indicating protection; hence, reduced dispersal could be adaptive for aphids. If, however, dispersal is primarily a means to reduce competition or to maintain persistent metapopulations, then manipulation by ants could be detrimental. Such manipulation strategies, common in host-parasite and predator-prey interactions, may be more common in mutualism than expected.

TI Effects of host migration, diversity and aquaculture on sea lice threats
   to Pacific salmon populations
AB Animal migrations can affect disease dynamics. One consequence of migration common to marine fish and invertebrates is migratory allopatry -a period of spatial separation between adult and juvenile hosts, which is caused by host migration and which prevents parasite transmission from adult to juvenile hosts. We studied this characteristic for sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from one of the Canada's largest salmon stocks. Migratory allopatry protects juvenile salmon from L. salmonis for two to three months of early marine life (2-3% prevalence). In contrast, host diversity facilitates access for C. clemensi to juvenile salmon (8-20% prevalence) but infections appear ephemeral. Aquaculture can augment host abundance and diversity and increase parasite exposure of wild juvenile fish. An empirically parametrized model shows high sensitivity of salmon populations to increased L. salmonis exposure, predicting population collapse at one to five motile L. salmonis per juvenile pink salmon. These results characterize parasite threats of salmon aquaculture to wild salmon populations and show how host migration and diversity are important factors affecting parasite transmission in the oceans.

TI Who is in control of the stickleback immune system: interactions between
   Schistocephalus solidus and its specific vertebrate host
AB The cestode Schistocephalus solidus is a frequent parasite of three-spined sticklebacks and has a large impact on its host's fitness. Selection pressure should therefore be high on stickleback defence mechanisms, like an efficient immune system, and also on parasite strategies to overcome these. Even though there are indications for manipulation of the immune system of its specific second intermediate host by the cestode, nothing is yet known about the chronology of specific interactions of S. solidus with the stickleback immune system. We here expected sticklebacks to first mount an innate immune response directly post-exposure to the parasite to clear the infection at an early stage and after an initial lag phase to upregulate adaptive immunity. Most interestingly, we did not find any upregulation of the specific lymphocyte-mediated immune response. Also, the pattern of activation of the innate immune system did not match our expectations: the proliferation of monocytes followed fluctuating kinetics suggesting that the parasite repeatedly installs a new surface coat not immunogenic to the host. Furthermore, the respiratory burst activity, which has the potential to clear an early S. solidus infection, was upregulated very late during infection, when the parasite was too big to be cleared but ready for transmission to its final host. We here suggest that the late activation of the innate immune system interferes with the neuroendocrine system, which mediates reduced predation avoidance behaviour and so facilitates the transmission to the final host.

TI Quasi-species evolution in subdivided populations favours maximally
   deleterious mutations
AB Most models of quasi-species evolution predict that populations will evolve to occupy areas of sequence space with the greatest concentration of neutral sequences, thus minimizing the deleterious mutation rate and creating mutationally 'robust' genomes. In contrast, empirical studies of the principal model of quasispecies evolution, RNA viruses, suggest that the effects of deleterious mutations are more severe than in similar DNA-based microbes. We demonstrate that populations divided into discrete patches connected by dispersal may favour genotypes where the deleterious effect of non-neutral mutations is maximized. This effect is especially strong in the absence of back mutation and when the amount of time spent in hosts prior to dispersal is intermediate. Our results indicate that RNA viruses that produce acute infections initiated by a small number of virions are expected to evolve fragile genetic architectures when compared with other RNA viruses.

TI Pathogen evolution and disease emergence in carnivores
AB Emerging infectious diseases constitute some of the most pressing problems for both human and domestic animal health, and biodiversity conservation. Currently it is not clear whether the removal of past constraints on geographical distribution and transmission possibilities for pathogens alone are sufficient to give rise to novel host-pathogen combinations, or whether pathogen evolution is also generally required for establishment in novel hosts. Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a morbillivirus that is prevalent in the world dog population and poses an important conservation threat to a diverse range of carnivores. We performed an extensive phylogenetic and molecular evolution analysis on complete sequences of all CDV genes to assess the role of selection and recombination in shaping viral genetic diversity and driving the emergence of CDV in non-dog hosts. We tested the specific hypothesis that molecular adaptation at known receptor-binding sites of the haemagglutinin gene is associated with independent instances of the spread of CDV to novel non-dog hosts in the wild. This hypothesis was upheld, providing compelling evidence that repeated evolution at known functional sites (in this case residues 530 and 549 of the haemagglutinin molecule) is associated with multiple independent occurrences of disease emergence in a range of novel host species.

AB We collected a total of 15,329 mosquitoes during weekly sampling in Davis, CA, from April through mid-October 2006 at 21 trap sites uniformly spaced 1.5 km apart over an area of similar to 26 km(2). Of these mosquitoes, 1,355 pools of Culex spp. were tested by multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, of which 16 pools (1.2%) were positive for West Nile virus (WNV). A degree-day model with a developmental threshold of 14.3 degrees C accurately predicted episodic WNV transmission after three extrinsic incubation periods after initial detection. Kriging interpolation delineated that Culex tarsalis were most abundant at traps near surrounding agriculture, whereas Cx. pipiens clustered within residential areas and greenbelt systems in the old portion of Davis. Spatial -temporal analyses were performed to test for clustering of locations of WNV-infected dead birds and traps with WNV-positive Cx. tarsalis and Cx. pipiens; human case incidence was mapped by census blocks. Significant multivariate spatial -temporal clustering was detected among WNV-infected dead birds and WNV-positive Cx. tarsalis, and a WNY-positive Cx. pipiens cluster overlapped areas with high incidences of confirmed human cases. Spatial analyses of WNV surveillance data may be an effective method to identify areas with an increased risk for human infection and to target control efforts to reduce the incidence of human disease.

AB A vectored vaccine based on equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) was generated as an alternative for safe and efficient prophylaxis against Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) infection. Two-step (en passant) Red mutagenesis was used to insert VEEV structural genes into an infectious clone of EHV-1 vaccine strain RacH. The recombinant virus, rH_VEEV, efficiently and stably expressed VEEV structural proteins as detected by various antibodies, including a conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody to envelope glycoprotein E2. In addition, rH_VEEV was indistinguishable from parental bacterial artificial chromosome-derived virus with respect to growth properties in cultured cells. Immunization of mice with the vectored vaccine conferred full protection against lethal challenge infection using VEEV strain ZPC738 in the absence of neutralizing antibodies and in a dose-dependent manner. Analyses of IgG responses demonstrated production of VEEV-specific IgG1 and total IgG antibodies after vaccination, indicating that protection was dependent on either cytotoxic T cell responses or antibody-mediated protection unrelated to neutralizing activity.

TI Short report: A filter paper method for the detection of Plasmodium
   falciparum gametocytes by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction
AB Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes are obligate parasite sexual stages required for transmission of malaria from human hosts to the mosquito vector. Assessment of gametocyte carriers in the population is critical in understanding malaria transmission dynamics and in epidemiology studies. We applied a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based approach to detect pfs25 transcripts from blood dried on different filter papers in the laboratory. The detection limit was 1-2 gametocytes/mu L. We further validated this assay by analyzing RNA in 10 matched blood samples (liquid blood and blood spotted on filter papers) collected from subjects under field conditions in Zambia. These results thus establish feasibility of detection of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes by RT-PCR method from dried blood on filter paper. This assay will greatly facilitate bulk analysis of gametocyte RNA transcripts on filter paper, especially in areas where collection and preservation of liquid blood is not feasible.

TI Evidence for suppression of Onchocerca volvulus transmission in the
   Oaxaca focus in Mexico
AB Entomologic and serologic surveys were performed in four sentinel communities in the Oaxaca focus in southern Mexico to assess the level of transmission and exposure incidence to Onchocerca volvulus. All communities have been receiving ivermectin mass treatment twice per year since 1997. In one community, parasite DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 2004 in one pool of 50 vector heads of 170 such pools (8,500 flies) examined, which indicated an estimated transmission potential of 6.7 third-stage larvae/person/year. No evidence for transmission was found in the three other communities in 13,650 flies examined. All persons in a cohort consisting of 117 children in the four communities remained serologically negative for antibodies recognizing a cocktail of recombinant antigens over a four-year period from 2001 to 2004, which indicated an exposure incidence of 0%. Taken together, these data suggest that transmission has been. suppressed in the four communities.

TI Evolution of virulence: triggering host inflammation allows invading
   pathogens to exclude competitors
AB Virulence is generally considered to benefit parasites by enhancing resource-transfer from host to pathogen. Here, we offer an alternative framework where virulent immune-provoking behaviours and enhanced immune resistance are joint tactics of invading pathogens to eliminate resident competitors (transferring resources from resident to invading pathogen). The pathogen wins by creating a novel immunological challenge to which it is already adapted. We analyse a general ecological model of 'proactive invasion' where invaders not adapted to a local environment can succeed by changing it to one where they are better adapted than residents. However, the two-trait nature of the 'proactive' strategy (provocation of, and adaptation to environmental change) presents an evolutionary conundrum, as neither trait alone is favoured in a homogenous host population. We show that this conundrum can be resolved by allowing for host heterogeneity. We relate our model to emerging empirical findings on immunological mediation of parasite competition.

TI Integrated approaches and empirical models for investigation of
   parasitic diseases in northern wildlife
AB The North is a frontier for exploration of emerging infectious diseases and the large-scale drivers influencing distribution, host associations, and evolution of pathogens among persons, domestic animals, and wildlife. Leading into the International Polar Year 2007-2008, we outline approaches, protocols, and empirical models derived from a decade of integrated research on northern host-parasite systems. Investigations of emerging infectious diseases associated with parasites in northern wildlife involved a network of multidisciplinary collaborators and incorporated geographic surveys, archival collections, historical foundations for diversity, and laboratory and field studies exploring the interface for hosts, parasites, and the environment. In this system, emergence of parasitic disease was linked to geographic expansion, host switching, resurgence due to climate change, and newly recognized parasite species. Such integrative approaches serve as cornerstones for detection, prediction, and potential mitigation of emerging infectious diseases in wildlife and persons in the North and elsewhere under a changing global climate.

TI The evolution of specificity in evolving and coevolving antagonistic
   interactions between a bacteria and its phage
AB The evolution of exploitative specificity can be influenced by environmental variability in space and time and the intensity of trade-offs. Coevolution, the process of reciprocal adaptation in two or more species, can produce variability in host exploitation and as such potentially drive patterns in host and parasite specificity. We employed the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its DNA phage Phi 2 to investigate the role of coevolution in the evolution of phage infectivity range and its relation with phage growth rate. At the phage population level, coevolution led to the evolution of broader infectivity range, but without an associated decrease in phage growth rate relative to the ancestor, whereas phage evolution in the absence of bacterial evolution led to an increased growth rate but no increase in infectivity range. In contrast, both selection regimes led to phage adaptation (in terms of growth rates) to their respective bacterial hosts. At the level of individual phage genotypes, coevolution resulted in within-population diversification in generalist and specialist infectivity range types. This pattern was consistent with a multilocus gene-for-gene interaction, further confirmed by an observed cost of broad infectivity range for individual phage. Moreover, coevolution led to the emergence of bacterial genotype by phage genotype interactions in the reduction of bacterial growth rate by phage. Our study demonstrates that the strong reciprocal selective pressures underlying the process of coevolution lead to the emergence and coexistence of different strategies within populations and to specialization between selective environments.

TI Cowpox virus infection in natural field vole Microtus agrestis
   populations: significant negative impacts on survival
AB 1. Cowpox virus is an endemic virus circulating in populations of wild rodents. It has been implicated as a potential cause of population cycles in field voles Microtus agrestis L., in Britain, owing to a delayed density-dependent pattern in prevalence, but its impact on field vole demographic parameters is unknown. This study tests the hypothesis that wild field voles infected with cowpox virus have a lower probability of survival than uninfected individuals.
   2. The effect of cowpox virus infection on the probability of an individual surviving to the next month was investigated using longitudinal data collected over 2 years from four grassland sites in Kielder Forest, UK. This effect was also investigated at the population level, by examining whether infection prevalence explained temporal variation in survival rates, once other factors influencing survival had been controlled for.
   3. Individuals with a probability of infection, P(I), of 1 at a time when base survival rate was at median levels had a 22.4% lower estimated probability of survival than uninfected individuals, whereas those with a P(I) of 0.5 had a 10.4% lower survival.
   4. At the population level, survival rates also decreased with increasing cowpox prevalence, with lower survival rates in months of higher cowpox prevalence.
   5. Simple matrix projection models with 28 day time steps and two stages, with 71% of voles experiencing cowpox infection in their second month of life (the average observed seroprevalence at the end of the breeding season) predict a reduction in 28-day population growth rate during the breeding season from lambda = 1.62 to 1.53 for populations with no cowpox infection compared with infected populations.
   6. This negative correlation between cowpox virus infection and field vole survival, with its potentially significant effect on population growth rate, is the first for an endemic pathogen in a cyclic population of wild rodents.

TI Host plant species affects virulence in monarch butterfly parasites
AB 1. Studies have considered how intrinsic host and parasite properties determine parasite virulence, but have largely ignored the role of extrinsic ecological factors in its expression.
   2. We studied how parasite genotype and host plant species interact to determine virulence of the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (McLaughlin & Myers 1970) in the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus L. We infected monarch larvae with one of four parasite genotypes and reared them on two milkweed species that differed in their levels of cardenolides: toxic chemicals involved in predator defence.
   3. Parasite infection, replication and virulence were affected strongly by host plant species. While uninfected monarchs lived equally long on both plant species, infected monarchs suffered a greater reduction in their life spans (55% vs. 30%) on the low-cardenolide vs. the high-cardenolide host plant. These life span differences resulted from different levels of parasite replication in monarchs reared on the two plant species.
   4. The virulence rank order of parasite genotypes was unaffected by host plant species, suggesting that host plant species affected parasite genotypes similarly, rather than through complex plant species-parasite genotype interactions.
   5. Our results demonstrate that host ecology importantly affects parasite virulence, with implications for host-parasite dynamics in natural populations.

TI Sympatric genetic differentiation of a generalist pathogenic fungus,
   Botrytis cinerea, on two different host plants, grapevine and bramble
AB Prime candidates for sympatric ecological divergence include parasites that differentiate via host shifts, because different host species exert strong disruptive selection and because both hosts and parasites are continually co-evolving. Sympatric divergence may be fostered even more strongly in phytopathogenic fungi, in particular those where sex must occur on the host, which allows adaptation alone to restrict gene flow between populations developing on different hosts. We sampled populations of Botrytis cinerea, a generalist ascomycete fungus, on sympatric grapes and brambles in six regions in France. Microsatellite data were analyzed using standard population genetics, a population graph analysis and a Bayesian approach. In addition to confirming that B. cinerea reproduces sexually, our results showed that the fungal populations on the two hosts were significantly differentiated, indicating restricted gene flow, even in sympatry. In contrast, only weak geographical differentiation could be detected. These results support the possibility of sympatric divergence associated with host use in generalist parasites.

TI Do vertically transmitted symbionts co-existing in a single host compete
   or cooperate? A modelling approach
AB When several symbionts infect simultaneously the same host (multiple infections), the interactions between them affect the dynamics of the symbiotic population. Despite their widespread occurrence, associations with multiple vertically transmitted symbionts have attracted little attention. Vertical transmission tends to homogenize the symbiotic population because of the bottleneck that occurs at transmission. However, fitness advantages conferred on the host by the different symbionts or the induction of reproductive manipulations can make it possible for multiple infections to persist. We used a matrix population model to understand the kind of interactions that can emerge between vertically transmitted symbionts in established multiple infections. Selection acts only to maximize the production of multiply-infected offspring. For a wide range of parameters, this condition allows cooperation between symbionts to be selected for, through their co-transmission, even when it generates additional costs for female fecundity, a reduction in individual transmission, or affects the dependence upon other symbionts.

TI Epidemiological and evolutionary consequences of targeted vaccination
AB Recent theory has examined the way in which vaccination strategies are expected to influence the evolution of parasite virulence. Most of this work has assumed that vaccination is imposed on a homogeneous host population. However, host populations are typically composed of different types of individuals, with each type responding differently to infection. Moreover, actual interventions often focus treatment on those hosts that are likely to suffer the most ill effects of a particular disease. Here we consider the epidemiological and evolutionary consequences of interventions that focus vaccination on individuals expressing the greatest susceptibility to infection and/or the greatest vulnerability to mortality once infected. Our results indicate that predictions are very sensitive to the nature and degree of heterogeneity in susceptibility and vulnerability. They further suggest that accounting for realistic kinds of heterogeneity when contemplating targeted treatment plans and policies might provide a new tool in the design of more effective virulence management strategies.

TI Interspecific Hybridization Yields Strategy for South Pacific Filariasis
   Vector Elimination
AB Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a leading cause of disability in South Pacific regions, where >96% of the 1.7 million population are at risk of LF infection. As part of current global campaign, mass drug administration (MDA) has effectively reduced lymphatic filiariasis prevalence, but mosquito vector biology can complicate the MDA strategy. In some regions, there is evidence that the goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone. Obligate vector mosquitoes provide additional targets for breaking the LF transmission cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector throughout much of the South Pacific, Aedes polynesiensis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in an A. polynesiensis strain ('CP' strain) that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays demonstrate that CP males are equally competitive, resulting in population elimination when CP males are introduced into wild type A. polynesiensis populations.
   Conclusions/Significance: The findings demonstrate strategy feasibility and encourage field tests of the vector elimination strategy as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts.

TI Role played by Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 in lipoteichoic acid-induced
   lung inflammation and coagulation
AB Background. The cell wall of Streptococcus pneumoniae consists of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which is released when pneumococci are killed by either the host immune system or antibiotic treatment. Release of excessive amounts of LTA has been implicated in the toxic sequelae of severe gram-positive infection by virtue of its proinflammatory properties. Several in vitro studies have shown that LTA is recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and CD14. Our objective here was to investigate the inflammatory properties of S. pneumoniae LTA in vivo and the role played by TLR2, TLR4, and CD14 therein.
   Methods. Wild-type (WT), TLR2 knockout (KO), TLR4 KO, TLR2 X 4 double-KO, and CD14 KO mice were intranasally inoculated with highly purified pneumococcal LTA.
   Results. LTA induced a dose-dependent inflammatory response and activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways in a TLR2-dependent fashion. Surprisingly, TLR4 KO mice also displayed a somewhat diminished pulmonary inflammatory and coagulant response compared with WT mice, possibly as a result of absent TLR4 signaling through LTA-induced release of endogenous mediators.
   Conclusion. Pneumococcal LTA induces a profound inflammatory response and activation of the coagulation pathway in the lungs in vivo through a TLR2-dependent route, which likely is amplified by endogenous TLR4 ligands.

We found individuals homozygous for CCR5 Delta 32 (P = .026) only among patients with TBE and a higher allele prevalence among patients with TBE compared with the other groups studied. CCR5 Delta 32 allele prevalence also increased with the clinical severity of disease.

TI Epidemiologic characterization of the 1918 influenza pandemic summer
   wave in Copenhagen: Implications for pandemic control strategies
AB Background. The 1918-1919 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic killed similar to 50 million people worldwide. Historical records suggest that an early pandemic wave struck Europe during the summer of 1918.
   Methods. We obtained surveillance data that were compiled weekly, during 1910-1919, in Copenhagen, Denmark; the records included medically treated influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), hospitalizations, and deaths by age. We used a Serfling seasonal regression model to quantify excess morbidity and mortality, and we estimated the reproductive number (R) for the summer, fall, and winter pandemic waves.
   Results. A large epidemic occurred in Copenhagen during the summer of 1918; the age distribution of deaths was characteristic of the 1918-1919 A/H1N1 pandemic overall. That summer wave accounted for 29%-34% of all excess ILIs and hospitalizations during 1918, whereas the case-fatality rate (0.3%) was many-fold lower than that of the fall wave (2.3%). Similar patterns were observed in 3 other Scandinavian cities. R was substantially higher in summer (2.0-5.4) than in fall (1.2-1.6) in all cities.
   Conclusions. The Copenhagen summer wave may have been caused by a precursor A/H1N1 pandemic virus that transmitted efficiently but lacked extreme virulence. The R measured in the summer wave is likely a better approximation of transmissibility in a fully susceptible population and is substantially higher than that found in previous US studies. The summer wave may have provided partial protection against the lethal fall wave.

TI Conspicuous impacts of inconspicuous hosts on the Lyme disease epidemic
AB Emerging zoonotic pathogens are a constant threat to human health throughout the world. Control strategies to protect public health regularly fail, due in part to the tendency to focus on a single host species assumed to be the primary reservoir for a pathogen. Here, we present evidence that a diverse set of species can play an important role in determining disease risk to humans using Lyme disease as a model. Host-targeted public health strategies to control the Lyme disease epidemic in North America have focused on interrupting Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ( ss) transmission between blacklegged ticks and the putative dominant reservoir species, white-footed mice. However, B. burgdorferi ss infects more than a dozen vertebrate species, any of which could transmit the pathogen to feeding ticks and increase the density of infected ticks and Lyme disease risk. Using genetic and ecological data, we demonstrate that mice are neither the primary host for ticks nor the primary reservoir for B. burgdorferi ss, feeding 10% of all ticks and 25% of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks. Inconspicuous shrews feed 35% of all ticks and 55% of infected ticks. Because several important host species influence Lyme disease risk, interventions directed at a multiple host species will be required to control this epidemic.

AB Culex pipiens sensu lato mosquitoes were collected from 24 gravid traps (mid-June to mid-October, 2005) in Fresno County, CA. Captured gravid females were allowed to oviposit before sibling species identification by Ace.2 PCR and detection of West Nile virus (WNV) RNA by RT-PCR were performed on the mother and her offspring. Of the 442 Cx. pipiens s.l. female mosquitoes collected, 88 were positive for WNV viral RNA (peaked in August) with no significant differences among complex members or habitat. Vertical transmission was detected in 4 out of 20 families originating from WNV-positive mothers, however, in only a small number of offspring from each family. Out of 101 families that had PCR-based maternal and offspring identifications, the offspring from 1.5 families produced inexplicable amplicon patterns, suggesting ambiguities in the PCR assay identifications. Male genitalia (DV/D ratio) and Ace.2 PCR identifications revealed numerous discrepancies in our ability to accurately determine the identity of Cx. pipiens complex members in the hybrid zone of Fresno County.

   Kenya, October
AB An outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease associated with high fever and severe protracted arthralgias was detected in Lamu, Kenya, peaking in July 2004. At least 1,300 cases were documented. We conducted a seroprevalence study to define the magnitude of transmission on Lamu Island. We conducted a systematic cross-sectional survey. We administered questionnaires and tested 288 sera from Lamu residents for IgM and IgG antibodies to CHIKV. Chikungunya virus infection (seropositivity) was defined as a person with IgG and/or IgM antibodies to CHIKV. IgM antibodies to CHIKV were detected in 18% (53/288) and IgG antibodies in 72% (206/288); IgM and/or IgG antibodies were present in 75% (215/288). The scroprevalence findings suggested that the outbreak was widespread, affecting 75% of the Lamu population; extrapolating the findings to the entire population, 13,500 (95% CI, 12,45814328) were affected. Vector control strategies are needed to control the spread of this mosquito-borne infection.

TI Pathogen interactions, population cycles, and phase shifts
AB Interspecific pathogen interactions can profoundly affect pathogen population dynamics and the efficacy of control strategies. However, many pathogens exhibit cyclic abundance patterns (e. g., seasonality), and temporal asynchrony between interacting pathogens could reduce the impact of those interactions. Here we use an extension of our previously published model to investigate the effects of cycles on pathogen interaction. We demonstrate that host immune memory can maintain the impact of an interaction, even when the effector pathogen abundance is low or the pathogen is absent. Paradoxically, immune memory can result in pathogens interacting more strongly when temporally out of phase. We find that interactions between species can result in changes to the temporal pattern of the affected species. We further demonstrate that this may be observed in a natural host-pathogen system. Given the continuing debate regarding the relevance of pathogen interactions in natural systems and increasing concern about treatment strategies for coinfections, both the discovery of a shift in cycle in empirical data and the mechanism by which we identified it are important. Finally, because the model structure used here is analogous to models of a simple predator-prey system, we also consider the consequences of these findings in the context of that system.

TI Climate-driven spatial dynamics of plague among prairie dog colonies
AB We present a Bayesian hierarchical model for the joint spatial dynamics of a host-parasite system. The model was fitted to long-term data on regional plague dynamics and metapopulation dynamics of the black-tailed prairie dog, a declining keystone species of North American prairies. The rate of plague transmission between colonies increases with increasing precipitation, while the rate of infection from unknown sources decreases in response to hot weather. The mean annual dispersal distance of plague is about 10 km, and topographic relief reduces the transmission rate. Larger colonies are more likely to become infected, but colony area does not affect the infectiousness of colonies. The results suggest that prairie dog movements do not drive the spread of plague through the landscape. Instead, prairie dogs are useful sentinels of plague epizootics. Simulations suggest that this model can be used for predicting long-term colony and plague dynamics as well as for identifying which colonies are most likely to become infected in a specific year.

TI Testing the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis
   in a novel framework
AB The "evolution of increased competitive ability'' (EICA) hypothesis proposes that escape from natural enemies, e. g., after transcontinental introductions, alters the selection regime because costly defenses no longer enhance fitness. Such an evolutionary loss of defenses enables resources to be directed toward growth or other traits improving performance. We tested the EICA hypothesis in a novel framework in which the natural enemy is the traveler that follows its widespread host by accidental or deliberate (biocontrol) introductions. In a greenhouse experiment we used populations of Senecio vulgaris from North America, Europe, and Australia that differ in the history of exposure to the rust fungus Puccinia lagenophorae. Contrary to what is predicted by EICA, we found no evidence for increased levels of resistance to the rust fungus in plant populations with a longer history of rust exposure (Australia). Similarly, there was no evidence for reduced fecundity in these populations, although vegetative vigor, measured as secondary branching and growth rate, was lower. The maintenance of high rust resistance in populations with no (North America) or only a short history (Europe) of rust exposure is surprising given that resistance seems to incur considerable fitness costs, as indicated by the negative association between family mean resistance and fitness in the absence of disease observed for all three continents. The comparison of population differentiation in quantitative traits with estimates of differentiation in amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers suggests that a number of fitness-related traits are under divergent selection among the studied populations. The proposed framework to test changes in the evolutionary trajectory underlying EICA can be employed in an expanded range of systems. These may include investigations on a cosmopolitan weed or crop when an antagonist is expanding its geographic range (such as our study), studies along a chronosequence of introduction time with expected increasing accumulation of natural enemies over time, or comparisons between introduced plant populations that differ in exposure time to biocontrol organisms.

AB We report the first population-based case-control study on acute hepatitis B in a very low-incidence country. A case was a Netherlands resident, notified between May 1999 and July 2000 with symptoms and serology compatible with acute hepatitis B. Population controls were randomly selected, with oversampling from men and persons aged 20-39 years. Risk factors were studied using logistical regression, distinguishing confounders and mediators through hierarchical analysis. Participants were 120 cases and 3948 controls. The risk of acute hepatitis B was increased in men who have sex with men, with reporting to have had more than two partners in the past 6 months the only significant risk. In children, adult females and heterosexual males, having parents born in a hepatitis B endemic country was a significant risk. For adult females and heterosexual males, this was largely explained by having a foreign partner. For children this was partly explained by parenteral exposures abroad.

AB Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) has been suffering from its first known Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemic since February 2005. To achieve a better understanding of the disease, a questionnaire was drawn up for hospital staff members and their household. CHIKV infected about one-third of the Studied population, the proportion increasing with age and being higher in women. Presence of a garden was associated with CHIKV infection. The geographical distribution of cases was concordant with insect vector Aedes albopictus distribution. The main clinical signs were arthralgia and fever. The disease evolved towards full recovery in 34.4 % of cases, a relapse in 55.6 %, or a chronic form in 10 %. Paracetamol was used as a painkiller in 95 % of cases, sometimes associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticolds, or traditional herbal medicine. The survey provided valuable information on the factors that favour transmission, the clinical signs, the importance of relapses and the therapies used.

TI Population structure, levels of selection, and the evolution of
   intracellular symbionts
AB Many obligately intracellular symbionts exhibit a characteristic set of genetic changes that include an increase in substitution rates, loss of many genes, and apparent destabilization of many proteins and structural RNAs. Authors have suggested that these changes are due to increased mutation rates, or, more commonly, decreased effective population size due to population bottlenecks at the symbiont or, perhaps, host level. I propose that the increase in substitution rates and accumulation of deleterious mutations is a consequence of the population structure imposed on the endosymbionts by strict host association, loss of horizontal transmission and potentially conflicting levels of selection. I analyze a population genetic model of endosymbiont evolution, and demonstrate that substitution rates will increase, and the effect of those substitutions on endosymbiont fitness will become more deleterious as horizontal transmission among hosts decreases. Additionally, I find that there is a critical level of horizontal transmission below which natural selection cannot effectively purge deleterious mutations, leading to an expected loss of fitness over time. This critical level varies across loci with the degree of correlation between host and endosymbiont fitness, and may help explain differential retention and loss of certain genes.

TI Balancing ecological complexity in predictive models: a reassessment of
   risk models in the mountain pine beetle system
AB 1. The nature of ecological risk assessment is to predict the probability of an event, such as extinction or invasion, in a location where the event has rarely occurred. This typically requires developing risk models from data on events in different locations. One perplexing challenge in developing these models is to find the optimal balance of model complexity that reflects the tactical details of a system, but is sufficiently strategic to be applicable under a wide range of situations.
   2. Here we address the balance of complexity in risk models for the mountain pine beetle system. Mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) are destructive pests of pine forests in western North America. Much effort has gone into collecting empirical evidence and developing mechanistic models of infestation dynamics, which has resulted in a wealth of process-based information. Current risk models, however, are based solely on indices of stand susceptibility that do not incorporate much of this ecological understanding. In practice, current risk models have proven ineffective at predicting the risk or extent of an infestation.
   3. We assemble an ecological framework of the beetle-host interaction that allows us to compare across phenomenological and mechanistic models. We demonstrate that current risk models predict only ranked risk among forest stands, as opposed to absolute risk, and thereby provide an explanation for their limited ability to predict risk in practice. By comparing existing models with the ecological framework, we identify the primary factors determining risk, and propose which dynamical processes should be modelled explicitly, and which might be strategically abstracted.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Balancing model complexity in predictive risk models is challenging for systems with complex ecology and imperfect information. Here we draw together a wide range of empirical and modelling work in the mountain pine beetle system to develop a strategic framework of the ecological interactions. Through this framework, we demonstrate why current risk models have been ineffective in predicting risk, and suggest a starting point for future risk models that explicitly describe the dynamical processes necessary to predict absolute risk.

AB Background. Cryptosporidium species are a common cause of diarrhea, which can be severe and protracted in young children and immunocompromised individuals.
   Methods. A cohort of 226 Bangladeshi children aged 2-5 years was prospectively followed for >3 years to study the role of host genetics in susceptibility to infection, as well as the community impact of cryptosporidiosis on this population.
   Results. Ninety-six children (42.5%) received a diagnosis of Cryptosporidium infection. A total of 51 (22.6%) had asymptomatic infection. Fifty-eight (25.7%) had cryptosporidiosis, of whom 17 (29.3%) had recurrent disease. Children with cryptosporidiosis presented early, and most had abdominal pain and a short course of diarrhea. Infected children were more likely to carry the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II DQB1*0301 allele, particularly those with asymptomatic and symptomatic infection (P = .009); a strong association was found between carriage of the DQB1*0301/DRB1*1101 haplotype and development of both asymptomatic and symptomatic infection (P = .008). Infected children were also more likely to carry the B*15 HLA class I allele.
   Conclusions. This is the first study to describe a possible genetic component of the immune response to Cryptosporidium infection, which includes HLA class I and II alleles. Cryptosporidiosis in Bangladeshi children aged 2-5 years is common and often recurrent, but the duration is shorter and the abdominal pain greater than that described in children aged <2 years.

TI Reducing tick burdens on chicks by treating breeding female grouse with

AB Ticks are important arthropod vectors of diseases of human, livestock, and wildlife hosts. In the United Kingdom, the sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus) is increasingly recognized as a main limiting factor of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus) populations, a game bird of high economic value. We evaluated the effectiveness of a new practical technique that could help managers reduce negative impacts of ticks on young grouse. In a replicated field experiment, we treated breeding females with leg bands impregnated with permethrin, a slow-releasing potent acaracide. We found that treatment reduced tick burdens on young chicks. Because this treatment is easily applied, it offers a new practical management tool to tackle problems caused by ticks in game bird populations.

TI Host-parasite interactions in oligotrophic stream ecosystems: the roles
   of life-history strategy and ecological niche
AB Biodiversity in fluvial ecosystems is under pressure as a consequence of their degradation. Conservation strategies for endangered freshwater molluscs and for salmonid fishes have been proposed but they are typically poorly integrated. Here, we examined for the first time the genetic structure of a critically endangered obligate mollusc invertebrate parasite, the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera), and its vertebrate host fish, the brown trout (Salmo trutta m. fario), in European headwater streams. We compared genetic differentiation and diversity with productivity and ecological habitat features of both species in nine different European streams from the drainage systems of the Danube, Elbe, Weser, Tuuloma, Kemijoki and Aulne. Genetic differentiation was more pronounced in pearl mussel than in brown trout, although the drainage-specific patterns were generally similar. Genetic diversity of host and parasite was negatively correlated. The most oligotrophic, postglacially colonized areas represented genetic diversity hotspots with high conservation priority for pearl mussels, whereas their host fish displayed low diversity in these areas. This pattern can be explained by differences in the ecological niches and in the life-history strategies of both species. These results question the effectiveness of single-species approaches in the conservation of genetic aquatic resources and suggest that genetic information from species with different life-history strategies, such as invertebrates and fish, should be considered simultaneously for geographical conservation prioritization in stream ecosystems.

TI Population dynamics of defensive symbionts in aphids
AB Vertically transmitted micro-organisms can increase in frequency in host populations by providing net benefits to hosts. While laboratory studies have identified diverse beneficial effects conferred by inherited symbionts of insects, they have not explicitly examined the population dynamics of mutualist symbiont infection within populations. In the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, the inherited facultative symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, provides protection against parasitism by the wasp, Aphidius ervi. Despite a high fidelity of vertical transmission and direct benefits of infection accruing to parasitized aphids, Hamiltonella remains only at intermediate frequencies in natural populations. Here, we conducted population cage experiments to monitor the dynamics of Hamiltonella and of another common A. pisum symbiont, Serratia symbiotica, in the presence and absence of parasitism. We also conducted fitness assays of Hamiltonella-infected aphids to search for costs to infection in the absence of parasitism. In the population cages, we found that the frequency of A. pisum infected with Hamiltonella increased dramatically after repeated exposure to parasitism by A. ervi, indicating that selection pressures from natural enemies can lead to the increase of particular inherited symbionts in insect populations. In our laboratory fitness assays, we did not detect a cost to infection with Hamiltonella, but in the population cages not exposed to parasitism, we found a significant decline in the frequency of both Hamiltonella and Serratia. The declining frequencies of Hamiltonella-infected aphids in population cages in the absence of parasitism indicate a probable cost to infection and may explain why Hamiltonella remains at intermediate frequencies in natural populations.

TI Persistence of the emerging pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
   outside the amphibian host greatly increases the probability of host
   extinction
AB Pathogens do not normally drive their hosts to extinction; however, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes amphibian chytridiomycosis, has been able to do so. Theory predicts that extinction can be caused by long-lived or saprobic free-living stages. The hypothesis that such a stage occurs in B. dendrobatidis is supported by the recent discovery of an apparently encysted form of the pathogen. To investigate the effect of a free-living stage of B. dendrobatidis on host population dynamics, a mathematical model was developed to describe the introduction of chytridiomycosis into a breeding population of Bufo bufo, parametrized from laboratory infection and transmission experiments. The model predicted that the longer that B. dendrobatidis was able to persist in water, either due to an increased zoospore lifespan or saprobic reproduction, the more likely it was that it could cause local B. bufo extinction (defined as decrease below a threshold level). Establishment of endemic B. dendrobatidis infection in B. bufo, with severe host population depression, was also possible, in agreement with field observations. Although this model is able to predict clear trends, more precise predictions will only be possible when the life history of B. dendrobatidis, including free-living stages of the life cycle, is better understood.

TI Trichomonas vaginalis infection and human immunodeficiency virus
   acquisition in African women
AB Background. Trichomoniasis vaginalis is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide, with a particularly high prevalence in regions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) endemicity. However, its impact as a cofactor for HIV acquisition is poorly understood.
   Methods. Samples from 213 women who experienced HIV seroconversion (cases) during a longitudinal study involving 4450 women in Uganda and Zimbabwe were matched with samples from HIV-uninfected women (controls). All samples underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for Trichomonas vaginalis DNA. For cases, analyzed samples were from the visit in which HIV seroconversion was detected and the visit preceding detection of seroconversion; for controls, one analyzed sample was from the visit matched by follow-up duration to the cases' seroconversion visit, and the other sample was from the visit immediately preceding the matched visit.
   Results. The prevalence of T. vaginalis infection before HIV infection was 11.3% in cases and 4.5% in controls (P = .002). In multivariable analysis controlling for hormonal contraception, other STIs, behavioral, and demographic factors, the adjusted odds ratio for HIV acquisition was 2.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.25-6.00) for T. vaginalis-positive cases. The presence of behavioral risk factors for HIV infection, study recruitment from a referral population at high-risk for HIV, primary sex partner-associated risk for HIV infection, and herpes simplex virus type 2 seropositivity were also predictive of incident HIV infection.
   Conclusions. T. vaginalis infection is strongly associated with an increased risk for HIV infection in this general population of African women. Given the high prevalence of T. vaginalis infection in HIV-endemic areas, T. vaginalis control may have a substantial impact on preventing HIV acquisition among women.

TI Ecology of avian influenza virus in birds
AB Avian influenza A virus (an orthomyxovirus) is a zoonotic pathogen with a natural reservoir entirely in birds. The influenza virus genome is an 8-segment single-stranded RNA with high potential for in situ recombination. Two segments code for the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) antigens used for host-cell entry. At present, 16 H and 9 N subtypes are known, for a total of 144 possible different influenza subtypes, each with potentially different host susceptibility. With > 10,000 species of birds found in nearly every terrestrial and aquatic habitat, there are few places on earth where birds cannot be found. The avian immune system differs from that of humans in several important features, including asynchronous B and T lymphocyte systems and a polymorphic multigene immune complex, but little is known about the immunogenetics of pathogenic response. Postbreeding dispersal and migration and a naturally high degree of environmental vagility mean that wild birds have the potential to be vectors that transmit highly pathogenic variants great distances from the original sources of infection.

TI Genetic strategy to prevent influenza virus infections in animals
AB The natural reservoirs of influenza viruses are aquatic birds. After adaptation, avian viruses can acquire the ability to infect humans and cause severe disease. Because domestic poultry serves as a key link between the natural reservoir of influenza viruses and epidemics and pandemics in human populations, an effective measure to control influenza would be to eliminate or reduce influenza virus infection in domestic poultry. The development and distribution of influenza-resistant poultry represents a proactive strategy for controlling the origin of influenza epidemics and pandemics in both poultry and human populations. Recent developments in RNA interference and transgenesis in birds should facilitate the development of influenza-resistant poultry.

TI Symbiont-mediated protection
AB Despite the fact that all vertically transmitted symbionts sequester resources from their hosts and are therefore costly to maintain, there is an extraordinary diversity of them in invertebrates. Some spread through host populations by providing their hosts with fitness benefits or by manipulating host sex ratio, but some do not: their maintenance in host lineages remains an enigma. In this review, I explore the evolutionary ecology of vertically transmitted symbionts and their impact on host resistance, and provide an overview of the evidence for the three-way interactions between these symbionts, natural enemies and invertebrate hosts. A number of recent empirical and theoretical studies suggest that vertically transmitted symbionts may protect their hosts from pathogens. If this 'symbiont-mediated protection' is widespread, it is likely that vertically transmitted symbionts contribute significantly to variation in measures of invertebrate resistance to natural enemies.

TI Epidemic dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever at the Texas-Mexico border:
   Results of a household-based seroepiderniologic survey, December 2005
AB A dengue-2 epidemic causing dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) occurred in the contiguous border cities of Matamoros, Tamaulipas (Mexico), and Brownsville, TX, in 2005. In December, we conducted a household-based epidemiologic survey to determine the incidence and seroprevalence of dengue infection among Matamoros and Brownsville residents and to identify risk factors associated with infection. Antibodies to dengue were measured in 273 individuals. The estimated incidence of recent dengue infection was 32% and 4% among Matamoros and Brownsville participants, respectively. The estimated prevalence of past dengue infection was 77% and 39% among Matamoros and Brownsville participants, respectively. The Breteau index was 28 in Matamoros and 16 in Brownsville, reflecting an abundant winter population of Aedes mosquitoes. Discarded waste tires and buckets were the two largest categories of infested containers found in both cities. Our results underscore the risk for epidemic dengue and DHF in the Texas-Mexico border region.

   equine encephalitis virus
AB Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) continues to circulate enzootically in Mexico with the potential to re-emerge and cause disease in equines and humans in North America. We infected two geographically distinct mosquito populations of eastern Psorophora columbiae form columbiae (Chiapas, Mexico and Texas, United States) and one mosquito population of western Psorophora columbiae form toltecum (California, United States) with epizootic and enzootic IE VEEV and epizootic IAB VEEV. We detected no differences between epizootic and enzootic IE viruses in their ability to infect any of the mosquito populations analyzed, which suggested that neither species selects for epizootic IE viruses. Psorophora columbiae f. columbiae (Texas) were significantly less susceptible to infection by epizootic IE than Ps. columbiae f. columbiae (Mexico). Psorophora columbiae f. toltecum populations were more susceptible than Ps. columbiae f. columbiae populations to epizootic IE and IAB viruses.

TI A meta-analysis of factors affecting local adaptation between
   interacting species
AB Adaptive divergence among populations can result in local adaptation, whereby genotypes in native environments exhibit greater fitness than genotypes in novel environments. A body of theory has developed that predicts how different species traits, such as rates of gene flow and generation times, influence local adaptation in coevolutionary species interactions. We used a meta-analysis of local-adaptation studies across a broad range of host-parasite interactions to evaluate predictions about the effect of species traits on local adaptation. We also evaluated how experimental design influences the outcome of local adaptation experiments. In reciprocally designed experiments, the relative gene flow rate of hosts versus parasites was the strongest predictor of local adaptation, with significant parasite local adaptation only in the studies in which parasites had greater gene flow rates than their hosts. When nonreciprocal studies were included in analyses, species traits did not explain significant variation in local adaptation, although the overall level of local adaptation observed was lower in the nonreciprocal than in the reciprocal studies. This formal meta-analysis across a diversity of host-parasite systems lends insight into the role of both biology (species traits) and biologists (experimental design) in detecting local adaptation in coevolving species interactions.

TI Chytridiomycosis survey in wild and captive Mexican amphibians
AB Mexico, a rich country in terms of amphibian diversity, hosts about 375 described species. Population declines have been documented for several species where it is evident that their habitat is being destroyed or modified. However, other species which inhabit pristine areas are declining as well. It has been suggested that the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (B.d.) may be one of the causes of the enigmatic declines in Mexico. We surveyed a total of 45 localities, in 12 states across Mexico, examining a total of 360 specimens representing 14 genera and 30 species. We also examined 91 specimens of Ambystoma mexicanum from a captive population in Mexico City as well as one Pachymedusa dacnicolor obtained in a pet shop. We used a two-tiered technique to detect the pathogen. For wild-caught specimens, we utilized light microscopy to identify presence of B.d. sporangia in amphibian skin. Then, to verify the infection, we used a quantitative real-time PCR assay on collected skin sections which is specific for B.d. For captive animals, we used a nonlethal version of the real-time PCR technique. We found evidence of B.d. infection in 111 animals comprising 14 species in 13 localities. A large percentage (84%) of Ambystoma mexicanum from the colony were infected with B.d. The two most highly infected individuals were the endangered Ambystoma mexicanum, from a captive colony, and Pachymedusa dacnicolor, purchased at a pet shop.

TI Influence of warming tendency on Culex pipiens population abundance and
   on the probability of West Nile Fever outbreaks (Israeli case study:
   2001-2005)
AB Climate change and West Nile fever (WNV) are both subjects of global importance. Many mosquitoes and the diseases they carry, including West Nile virus (WNV), are sensitive to temperature increase. The current study analyzes the lag correlations between weather conditions (especially air temperature) and 1) Culex pipiens mosquito population abundance, and 2) WNF frequency in humans, between 2001 and 2005 in Israel. These 5 years follow a long period with a documented tendency for temperature increase in the hot season in the country. Monthly anomalies of minimum and maximum temperatures, relative seasonal rainfall contribution, mosquito samplings (hazard level), and WNF cases (hospital admission dates and patients' addresses) were analyzed. Logistic regression was calculated between the climatic data and the mosquito samples, as Spearman correlations and Pearson cross-correlations were calculated between daily temperature values (or daily precipitation amounts) and the hospital admission dates. It was found that the disease appearance reflects the population distribution, while the risk tends to escalate around the metropolis characterized by an urban heat island. Positive anomalies of the temperature during the study period appear to have facilitated the mosquito abundance and, consequently, the disease emergence in humans. An important finding is the potential influence of extreme heat in the early spring on the vector population increase and on the disease's appearance weeks later. Awareness of such situations at the beginning of the spring may help authorities to reduce the disease risk before it becomes a real danger.

TI Urban wet environment as mosquito habitat in the upper midwest
AB Sampling of Culex larval habitat plays an important role in West Nile virus surveillance and control programs. Although many cities have established mosquito sampling programs and abatement districts, there is relatively little information describing the extent and ecology of urban surface waters and stormwater systems in different geographic areas and how these parameters affect mosquito communities and control strategies. An aerial survey of the city of Madison, Wisconsin revealed 521 above-ground wet sites. These included both constructed stormwater systems (ditches, retention ponds, detention ponds) and natural wetlands (marshes, flood areas, creeks, and rivers). Repeat sampling of 351 of these sites was conducted during 2004 and 2005. The majority of sites, 58% in 2004 and 72% in 2005, yielded no mosquito larvae, suggesting that physical and biological features of these wet sites limit the development of mosquito larvae. For both years, analysis of the positive samples revealed that less than 25% of sites produced Culex spp. while a small number of ditches and detention ponds were consistent "superproducers" of Culex larvae from year to year. This information will facilitate comparisons across geographical areas and provides insight into local variation in the public health risk due to mosquito transmission of human disease agents.

TI Antagonistic effects of a Mhc class I allele on malaria-infected house
   sparrows
AB Genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (Mhc) play a fundamental role during the immune response because MHC molecules expressed on cell surface allow the recognition and presentation of antigenic peptides to T-lymphocytes. Although Mhc alleles have been found to correlate with pathogen resistance in several host-parasite systems, several studies have also reported associations between Mhc alleles and an accrued infection risk or an accelerated disease progression. The existence of these susceptibility alleles is puzzling, as the cost generated by the infection should rapidly eliminate them from the population. Here, we show that susceptibility alleles may be maintained in a population of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) if they have antagonistic effects on different malaria parasites. We found that one Mhc class I allele was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in the risk to be infected with a Plasmodium strain, but with a 6.4-fold reduction in the risk to harbour a Haemoproteus strain. We suggest that this antagonistic effect might arise because Mhc genes can alter the competitive interactions between malaria parasites within the host.

TI Self-structuring in spatial evolutionary ecology
AB Spatial self-structuring has been a focus of recent interest among evolutionary ecologists. We review recent developments in the study of the interplay between spatial self-structuring and evolution. We first discuss the relative merits of the various theoretical approaches to spatial modelling in ecology. Second, we synthesize the main theoretical studies of the evolution of cooperation in spatially structured populations. We show that population viscosity is generally beneficial to cooperation, because cooperators can reap additional benefits from being clustered. A similar mechanism can explain the evolution of honest communication and of reduced virulence in host-parasite interactions. We also discuss some recent innovative empirical results that test these theories. Third, we show the relevance of these results to the general field of evolutionary ecology. An important conclusion is that kin selection is the main process that drives evolution of cooperation in viscous populations. Many results of kin selection theory can be recovered as emergent properties of spatial ecological dynamics. We discuss the implications of these results for the study of multilevel selection and evolutionary transitions. We conclude by sketching some perspectives for future research, with a particular emphasis on the topics of evolutionary branching, criticality, spatial fluctuations and experimental tests of theoretical predictions.

AB Recently, a changing pattern of hepatitis A epidemiology has been reported in the Indian population indicating a rise in the rate of hepatitis A infection among adults. The study's objective was to assess anti-HAV prevalence in voluntary blood donors from middle and high socioeconomic strata. Serum samples collected from voluntary blood donors from Pune city and its suburbs in the years 2002 and 2004-2005 were tested for anti-HAV IgG antibodies. Serum samples collected during 2004-2005 were examined for anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Positive samples were tested for HAV-RNA. Agewise anti-HAV positivity was significantly low in adults aged 18-25 years (90.4%) compared to those aged > 25 years (97.4%) (P<0.01). A decline in anti-HAV prevalence was significant in 2004-2005 compared to that in 2002 (96.5% vs. 92.1%) (P<0.01). Overall, in both adult age groups, the proportion of anti-HAV positivity was remarkably low in the high socioeconomic group (HSG) (88.96%) compared to that of the middle socioeconomic group (MSG) (95.86%) (P < 0.01). Anti-HAV IgM positivity was not significant (similar to 1%), however, presence of HAV-RNA in one of the samples indicated the possibility of horizontal transmission of HAV. Increase in seronegativity to HAV in HSG implicates a rise in the susceptible pool and indicates the need for vaccination against hepatitis A.

TI Density dependence and the spread of anthelmintic resistance
AB Variation in the strength of selection pressures acting upon different subpopulations may cause density-dependent regulatory processes to act differentially on particular genotypes and may influence the rate of selection of adaptive traits. Using host-helminth parasite systems as examples, we investigate the impact of different positive and negative density dependence on the potential spread of anthelmintic resistance. Following chemotherapy, the negative density-dependent processes restricting parasite population growth will be relaxed, increasing the genetic contribution of resistant parasites to the next generation. Simple deterministic models of directly transmitted nematodes that merge population dynamics and genetics show that the frequency of drug-resistant alleles may increase faster in species whose population size is down-regulated by density-dependent parasite fecundity than in species with density-dependent establishment or parasite mortality. A genetically structured population dynamics model of an indirectly transmitted nematode is used to highlight how population regulation will influence the resistance allele frequency in different parasite lifestages. Results indicate that surveys aimed at monitoring the evolution of drug resistance should consider carefully which life stage to sample, and the time following treatment samples should be collected. Anthelmintic resistance offers a good opportunity to apply fundamental evolutionary and ecological principles to the management of a potentially crucial public health problem.

AB Epidemiological models illustrate that parasites can drive fluctuations in host populations, but small-mammal ecologists have tended to reject parasitism as an important factor. In one of the few experimental tests of the impact of parasites on wildlife population dynamics, Pedersen and Greives reduced prevalence of intestinal nematodes in free-ranging populations of Peromyscus mice with and without access to supplemental food. In isolation, parasite removal and food addition reduced rates of population decline only modestly, but the two factors acted synergistically to strongly alleviate declines. It is tempting to disregard factors that, in isolation, have weak effects, but the results from Pedersen and Greives' multifactor experiment remind ecologists that complex factor interactions pervade real ecosystems.

TI Habitat fragmentation as a result of biotic and abiotic factors controls
   pathogen transmission throughout a host population
AB 1. The hypothesis that habitat fragmentation (biotic or abiotic) alters the transmission of disease within a population is explored using field data from a well-studied amphibian-pathogen system.
   2. We used the Ambystoma tigrinum-A. tigrinum virus (ATV) model system to show how habitat fragmentation as a result of emergent vegetation and habitat management affects disease transmission dynamics in ponds across a landscape.
   3. We quantified variation in ATV infection over time and across the landscape. ATV infection was significantly higher in ponds modified for livestock use (P = 0.032). Disease incidence decreased with increased amounts of emergent vegetation (P < 0.001). These factors appear to control disease transmission by altering the host contact rate and with it disease transmission.
   4. A field experiment to test the effect of emergent vegetation on the distribution of larvae in ponds demonstrated a behavioural change in larvae found in sparsely vegetated ponds. Microhabitat choices resulted in larvae being concentrated at the pond edge resulting in a 'halo effect' in sparsely vegetated ponds, whereas larvae in heavily vegetated ponds were distributed more evenly throughout. Microhabitat choice affects the effective density that larvae experience. This 'halo effect' increases contact rates in the shallows of sparsely vegetated ponds and increases the transmission of a directly transmitted pathogen.
   5. Despite recurrent epidemics of a lethal Ranavirus in tiger salamanders on the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona, USA, these populations persist. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of density-dependent transmission and homogeneous mixing, two increases key assumptions of epidemiological theory.

TI The interaction of parasites and resources cause crashes in a wild mouse
   population
AB 1. Populations of white-footed mice Peromyscus leucopus and deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus increase dramatically in response to food availability from oak acorn masts. These populations subsequently decline following this resource pulse, but these crashes cannot be explained solely by resource depletion, as food resources are still available as population crashes begin.
   2. We hypothesized that intestinal parasites contribute to these post-mast crashes; Peromyscus are infected by many intestinal parasites that are often transmitted by density-dependent contact and can cause harm to their hosts. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a factorial experiment in natural populations by supplementing food to mimic a mast and by removal of intestinal nematodes with the drug, ivermectin.
   3. Both food supplementation and the removal of intestinal nematodes lessened the rate and magnitude of the seasonal population declines as compared with control populations. However, the combination of food supplementation and removal of intestinal nematodes prevented seasonal population crashes entirely.
   4. We also showed a direct effect on the condition of individuals. Faecal corticosterone levels, an indicator of the stress response, were significantly reduced in populations receiving both food supplementation and removal of intestinal nematodes. This effect was observed in autumn, before the overwinter crash observed in control populations, which may indicate that stress caused by the combination of food limitation and parasite infection is a physiological signal that predicts low winter survival and reproduction.
   5. This study is one of the few to demonstrate that the interaction between resource availability and infectious disease is important for shaping host population dynamics and emphasizes that multiple factors may drive oscillations in wild animal populations.

TI Disease effects on reproduction can cause population cycles in seasonal
   environments
AB 1. Recent studies of rodent populations have demonstrated that certain parasites can cause juveniles to delay maturation until the next reproductive season. Furthermore, a variety of parasites may share the same host, and evidence is beginning to accumulate showing nonindependent effects of different infections.
   2. We investigated the consequences for host population dynamics of a disease-induced period of no reproduction, and a chronic reduction in fecundity following recovery from infection (such as may be induced by secondary infections) using a modified SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) model. We also included a seasonally varying birth rate as recent studies have demonstrated that seasonally varying parameters can have important effects on long-term host-parasite dynamics. We investigated the model predictions using parameters derived from five different cyclic rodent populations.
   3. Delayed and reduced fecundity following recovery from infection have no effect on the ability of the disease to regulate the host population in the model as they have no effect on the basic reproductive rate. However, these factors can influence the long-term dynamics including whether or not they exhibit multiyear cycles.
   4. The model predicts disease-induced multiyear cycles for a wide range of realistic parameter values. Host populations that recover relatively slowly following a disease-induced population crash are more likely to show multiyear cycles. Diseases for which the period of infection is brief, but full recovery of reproductive function is relatively slow, could generate large amplitude multiyear cycles of several years in length. Chronically reduced fecundity following recovery can also induce multiyear cycles, in support of previous theoretical studies.
   5. When parameterized for cowpox virus in the cyclic field vole populations (Microtus agrestis) of Kielder Forest (northern England), the model predicts that the disease must chronically reduce host fecundity by more than 70%, following recovery from infection, for it to induce multiyear cycles. When the model predicts quasi-periodic multiyear cycles it also predicts that seroprevalence and the effective date of onset of the reproductive season are delayed density-dependent, two phenomena that have been recorded in the field.

TI Bringing back the fruit into fruit fly-bacteria interactions
AB Female Mediterranean fruit flies (Ceratitis capitata) oviposit in fruits, within which the larvae develop. This development is associated with rapid deterioration of the fruit, and frequently with invasion by secondary pests. Most research on the associations between medflies and microorganisms has focused on the bacteria inhabiting the digestive system of the adult fly, while the role of the fruit in mediating, amplifying or regulating the fruit fly microflora has been largely neglected. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that the host fruit plays a role in perpetuating the fly-associated bacterial community. Using direct and cultured-based approaches, we show that this community is composed in its very large majority of diazotrophic and pectinolytic Enterobacteriaceae. Our data suggest that this fly-associated enterobacterial community is vertically transmitted from the female parent to its offspring. During oviposition, bacteria are transferred to the fruit, establish and proliferate within it, causing its decay. These results show that the host fruit is indeed a central partner in the fruit fly-bacterial interaction as these transmitted bacteria are amplified by the fruit, and subsequently maintained throughout the fly's life. This enterobacterial community may contribute to the fly's nitrogen and carbon metabolism, affecting its development and ultimately, fitness.

   Taxa; Phylogeography and the Current Distribution of Asian
   Schistosomiasis
AB Background: Schistosomiasis in humans along the lower Mekong River has proven a persistent public health problem in the region. The causative agent is the parasite Schistosoma mekongi (Trematoda: Digenea). A new transmission focus is reported, as well as the first study of genetic variation among S. mekongi populations. The aim is to confirm the identity of the species involved at each known focus of Mekong schistosomiasis transmission, to examine historical relationships among the populations and related taxa, and to provide data for use (a priori) in further studies of the origins, radiation, and future dispersal capabilities of S. mekongi.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: DNA sequence data are presented for four populations of S. mekongi from Cambodia and southern Laos, three of which were distinguishable at the COI (cox1) and 12S (rrnS) mitochondrial loci sampled. A phylogeny was estimated for these populations and the other members of the Schistosoma sinensium group. The study provides new DNA sequence data for three new populations and one new locus/population combination. A Bayesian approach is used to estimate divergence dates for events within the S. sinensium group and among the S. mekongi populations.
   Conclusions/Significance: The date estimates are consistent with phylogeographical hypotheses describing a Pliocene radiation of the S. sinensium group and a mid-Pleistocene invasion of Southeast Asia by S. mekongi. The date estimates also provide Bayesian priors for future work on the evolution of S. mekongi. The public health implications of S. mekongi transmission outside the lower Mekong River are also discussed.

TI Infections with Immunogenic Trypanosomes Reduce Tsetse Reproductive
   Fitness: Potential Impact of Different Parasite Strains on Vector
   Population Structure
AB The parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and its insect vector Glossina morsitans morsitans were used to evaluate the effect of parasite clearance (resistance) as well as the cost of midgut infections on tsetse host fitness. Tsetse flies are viviparous and have a low reproductive capacity, giving birth to only 6-8 progeny during their lifetime. Thus, small perturbations to their reproductive fitness can have a major impact on population densities. We measured the fecundity (number of larval progeny deposited) and mortality in parasite-resistant tsetse females and untreated controls and found no differences. There was, however, a typanosome-specific impact on midgut infections. Infections with an immunogenic parasite line that resulted in prolonged activation of the tsetse immune system delayed intrauterine larval development resulting in the production of fewer progeny over the fly's lifetime. In contrast, parasitism with a second line that failed to activate the immune system did not impose a fecundity cost. Coinfections favored the establishment of the immunogenic parasites in the midgut. We show that a decrease in the synthesis of Glossina Milk gland protein (GmmMgp), a major female accessory gland protein associated with larvagenesis, likely contributed to the reproductive lag observed in infected flies. Mathematical analysis of our empirical results indicated that infection with the immunogenic trypanosomes reduced tsetse fecundity by 30% relative to infections with the non-immunogenic strain. We estimate that a moderate infection prevalence of about 26% with immunogenic parasites has the potential to reduce tsetse populations. Potential repercussions for vector population growth, parasite-host coevolution, and disease prevalence are discussed.

This organism is not yet described or well studied, and its pathogenicity is unknown; however, investigations of the organism are warranted because of its high prevalence in A. americanum. This tick is extremely abundant at military training facilities in the south, central, and Mid-Atlantic United States, and many soldiers experience multiple concurrent tick bites. Bites by R. amblyommii-infected A. americanum may account for rates of SFG rickettsia seropositivity that are higher than reported rates of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) cases from the same location. Seroconversion to SFG rickettsia following bites of A. americanum may suggest that R. amblyommii is infectious in humans. Subclinical infection in the numerous A. americanum tick bite victims could contaminate donated blood and compromise immunodeficient recipients. Detection of R. amblyommii in questing A. americanum larvae suggests transovarial transmission. The absence of R. rickettsii, the agent of RMSF, in A. americanum may be due to transovarial interference by R. amblyommii. The likelihood of pathogen transmission by larvae is magnified by their habit of mass attack. The very small size of the larvae is also a risk factor for pathogen transmission. High R. amblyommii prevalence in populations of A. americanum presage co-infection with other A. americanum-borne pathogens. A. americanum nymphs and adults from APG were found to be co-infected with R. amblyommii and Borrelia lonestari, Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii, respectively, and larval pools were infected with both R. amblyommii and B. lonestari. Co-infections can compound effects and complicate diagnosis of tick-borne disease.

TI West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease incidence in the United States,
   2002-2006
AB As the geographic range of reported human West Nile virus (WNV) disease has expanded across the United States, seasonal transmission and outbreaks have persisted over several years in many areas of the country. West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease (WNND) case reports from 2002 to 2006 were reviewed to determine which areas of the country have the highest reported cumulative incidence and whether those areas have had consistently high annual incidence. During the 5-year period examined, 9632 cases of WNND were reported nationwide. The cumulative incidence of WNND ranged from 0.2 to 32.2 per 100,000 population by state and from 0.1 to 241.2 per 100,000 population by county. States and counties with the highest cumulative incidence were primarily located in the northern Great Plains. States with consistently high annual incidence included South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, New Mexico, Mississippi, Nebraska, Louisiana, and Colorado. All of these states, with the exception of New Mexico, were also among the states with the highest cumulative incidence. Counties with repeatedly high annual incidence were also primarily in the Great Plains and mid-South. The risk of WNND appears to be highest in areas where the primary WNV vectors are Culex tarsalis and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes.

TI Reproductive characteristics of Mastomys natalensis and Lassa virus
   prevalence in Guinea, West Africa
AB We recently reported increased prevalence of Lassa virus (LASV) infection in Mastomys natalensis during the rainy season in Guinea, West Africa. Here, the association of LASV prevalence with fecundity, fertility, and the age structure of the rodent population was analyzed using data from the previous study. The animals reproduced throughout the year, but highest fecundity was observed during the rainy season. Accordingly, the rodent population was aged at the beginning and young at the end of the rainy season. Lassa virus infection was observed in all age groups, including the very young, which is compatible with vertical transmission. However, since the prevalence of infection showed a trend with increasing age in the younger age groups, horizontal transmission by yet unknown mechanisms may also play a role in LASV transmission. Multivariate analysis did not show an association of LASV prevalence with any demographic variable studied. Rodent behavior influencing virus transmissibility and contaminated environment may therefore be responsible for spatial and seasonal variations in LASV prevalence in M. natalensis.

TI Differential exposure to Anaplasma phagocytophilum in rodent species in
   northern California
AB Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a zoonotic tick-borne rickettsial pathogen that causes granulocytic anaplasmosis (GA) in humans, horses, and dogs. In California, dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) are a putative reservoir host, and Ixodes pacificus is a vector for transmission from rodents to humans, dogs, and horses. Cases are clustered in coastal and Sierra Nevada foothill regions, but not necessarily in proximity to infected woodrats. This study was designed to compare exposures and active infections of A. phagocytophilum in multiple rodents at a fine spatial scale in a hyperenzootic area and to evaluate the spatial clustering of infections. Of 331 rodents, the seroprevalence was 14.5%, with 60% in tree squirrels (Sciurus griseus and Tamiasciurus douglasii), 29% in woodrats, 14% in flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), and 5% in chipmunks (Tamias senex). No seropositive ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) were detected. The seroprevalence was significantly higher west of the Trinity River (23.1%) than east (11.8%) of the river. One Douglas squirrel and one western gray squirrel were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive. There was more spatial clustering among seropositive animals compared with all animals tested across the spatial scales evaluated, and this clustering was significantly greater than expected by chance alone. A significant cluster of 24 seropositive animals was found west of the Trinity River, with a population of 56 animals considered within the 50% population-at-risk, and a radius of 362.8 meters. The diversity of cricetine and sciurid rodents infected suggests that squirrels and chipmunks may be underappreciated contributors to A. phagocytophilum ecology in the western United States. The spatial clustering of exposed animals suggests interesting underlying spatially heterogeneous environmental variables that could facilitate the persistence of A. phagocytophilum in nature.

TI Seasonality, cohort-dependence and the development of immunity in a
   natural host-nematode system
AB Acquired immunity is known to be a key modulator of the dynamics of many helminth parasites in domestic and human host populations, but its relative importance in natural populations is more controversial. A detailed long-term dataset on the gastrointestinal nematode Trichostrongylus retortaeformis in a wild population of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) shows clear evidence of seasonal acquired immunity in the age-structured infection profiles. By fitting a hierarchy of demographic infection immunity models to the observed age-structured infection patterns, we are able to quantify the importance of different components (seasonality, immunity and host age structure) of the parasite dynamics. We find strong evidence that the hosts' immunocompetence waxes and wanes with the seasons, but also contains a lifelong cohort factor, possibly acting through a maternal effect dependent on the host's month of birth. These observations have important and broad implications for the ecology of parasite infection in seasonal natural herbivore systems.

TI Combining mosquito vector and human disease data for improved assessment
   of spatial west nile virus disease risk
AB Assessments of spatial risk of exposure to vector-borne pathogens that combine vector and human disease data are needed for areas encompassing large tracts of public land with low population bases. We addressed this need for West Nile virus (WNV) disease in the northern Colorado Front Range by developing not only a spatial model for entomological risk of exposure to Culex tarsalis WNV vectors and an epidemiological risk map for WNV disease but also a novel risk-classification index combining data for these independently derived measures of entomological and epidemioloeical risk. Risk of vector exposure was high in the densely populated eastern plains portion of the Front Range but low in cooler montane areas to the west that are sparsely populated but used heavily for recreation in the summer. The entomological risk model performed well when applied to the western, mountainous part of Colorado and validated against epidemiologic data.

TI Selective predation and rapid evolution can jointly dampen effects of
   virulent parasites on Daphnia Populations
AB Parasites are ubiquitous and often highly virulent, yet clear examples of parasite-driven changes in host density in natural populations are surprisingly scarce. Here, we illustrate an example of this phenomenon and offer a theoretically reasonable resolution. We document the effects of two parasites, the bacterium Spirobacillus cienkowskii and the yeast Metschnikowia bicuspidata, on a common freshwater invertebrate, Daphnia dentifera. We show that while both parasites were quite virulent to individual hosts, only bacterial epidemics were associated with significant changes in host population dynamics and density. Our theoretical results may help explain why yeast epidemics did not significantly affect population dynamics. Using a model parameterized with data we collected, we argue that two prominent features of this system, rapid evolution of host resistance to the parasite and selective predation on infected hosts, both decrease peak infection prevalence and can minimize decline in host density during epidemics. Taken together, our results show that understanding the outcomes of host-parasite interactions in this Daphnia-microparasite system may require consideration of ecological context and evolutionary processes and their interaction.

TI Temperature-mediated patterns of local adaptation in a natural
   plant-pathogen metapopulation
AB There have been numerous investigations of parasite local adaptation, a phenomenon important from the perspectives of both basic and applied evolutionary ecology. Recent work has demonstrated that temperature has striking effects on parasite performance by mediating trade-offs in parasite life history and through genotype X environment interactions. To test whether parasite local adaptation is mediated by temperature, I measured the performance of sympatric populations against allopatric populations of a fungal pathogen, Podosphaera plantaginis, on its host Plantago lanceolata, across a temperature gradient. I used data on parasite life history and epidemiology to derive fitness estimates to measure local adaptation. The results demonstrate unambiguously that trajectories of host-parasite co-evolution are tightly coupled with parasite adaptation to the abiotic habitat, as the strength, and even direction, of local adaptation varied with temperature. Patterns of local adaptation further depended on how parasite fitness was estimated, highlighting the importance of choosing relevant fitness measures in studies of local adaptation.

TI Detection and prevalence patterns of group I coronaviruses in bats,
   northern Germany
AB We tested 315 bats from 7 different bat species in northern Germany for coronaviruses by reverse transcription-PCR. The overall prevalence was 9.8%. There were 4 lineages of group I coronaviruses in association with 4 different species of verspertilionid bats (Myotis dasycneme, M. daubentonii, Pipistrellus nathusii, P pygmaeus). The lineages formed a monophyletic clade of bat coronaviruses found in northern Germany. The clade of bat coronaviruses have a sister relationship with a clade of Chinese type I coronaviruses that were also associated with the Myotis genus (M. ricketti). Young age and ongoing lactation, but not sex or existing gravidity, correlated significantly with coronavirus detection. The virus is probably maintained on the population level by amplification and transmission in maternity colonies, rather than being maintained in individual bats.

   virus in a sahelian ecosystem
AB During the 2003 rainy season, a follow-up survey in sentinel chickens was undertaken to assess the seasonal transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) in a salielian ecosystem: the Ferlo (Senegal). The estimated incidence rate in chickens was 14% (95%, CI 7-29), with it very low level of transmission between July and September, and a transmission peak occurring between September and October. Comparing these results with the estimate obtained from a previous transversal serological study performed on horses the same year in the same area, the relevance of sentinel chickens in estimating the WNV transmission rate is highlighted. Conventionally adult mosquito populations disappear during the dry season but WN disease was shown to be endemic in the study area. The mechanisms of virus maintenance are discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether a temporary rise in sexual risk behaviour during war in Guinea-Bissau could explain the observed trends in HIV-1 and HIV-2 prevalence, and to explore the possible contribution of competitive elimination of HIV-2 by HIV-1 A simulation model of the heterosexual transmission of sexually transmitted infections was parameterized using demographic, behavioural and epidemiological data from rural Guinea-Bissau, and fitted to the observed HIV-1 and HIV-2 trends with and without a historic rise in risk behaviour. The observed trends could only be simulated by assuming a temporary rise in risk behaviour. Around 30% of the projected decline in HIV-2 prevalence from a peak of 8 center dot 7% to 4 center dot 3% in 2010 was due to competitive elimination by HIV-1. Importantly for public health, HIV-1 prevalence was predicted to continue increasing and to become the dominant HIV type by 2010. Data collection is required to validate this prediction.

TI Spatial pattern formation facilitates eradication of infectious diseases
AB 1. Control of animal-born diseases is a major challenge faced by applied ecologists and public health managers. To improve cost-effectiveness, the effort required to control such pathogens needs to be predicted as accurately as possible. In this context, we reviewed the anti-rabies vaccination schemes applied around the world during the past 25 years.
   2. We contrasted predictions from classic approaches based on theoretical population ecology (which governs rabies control to date) with a newly developed individual-based model. Our spatially explicit approach allowed for the reproduction of pattern formation emerging from a pathogen's spread through its host population.
   3. We suggest that a much lower management effort could eliminate the disease than that currently in operation. This is supported by empirical evidence from historic field data. Adapting control measures to the new prediction would save one-third of resources in future control programmes.
   4. The reason for the lower prediction is the spatial structure formed by spreading infections in spatially arranged host populations. It is not the result of technical differences between models.
   5. Synthesis and applications. For diseases predominantly transmitted by neighbourhood interaction, our findings suggest that the emergence of spatial structures facilitates eradication. This may have substantial implications for the cost-effectiveness of existing disease management schemes, and suggests that when planning management strategies consideration must be given to methods that reflect the spatial nature of the pathogen-host system.

TI Persistence of measles, mumps, and rubella antibodies in an
   MMR-vaccinated cohort: A 20-year follow-up
AB Background. The persistence of antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella induced by the measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR) vaccine and the kinetics of antibody decline after the second MMR vaccine dose were studied in the same cohort for 20 years.
   Methods. Measles, mumps, and rubella antibodies were measured by enzyme immunoassay in 20-year follow-up serum samples ( n = 183) of twice-vaccinated individuals, and measles antibodies were also measured in oral fluids ( n = 177). Antibody decay was determined in a group ( n = 58) with subsequent samples collected 1, 8, and 15 years after the second MMR dose.
   Results. In total, 95%, 74%, and 100% of 183 vaccinees were still seropositive for measles, mumps, and rubella, respectively, and 85% of 177 vaccinees had measurable measles antibodies in their oral fluids. The antibody levels declined significantly after the second dose, but subsequently the rate of decline was slower.
   Conclusions. A high rate of seropositivity was found 20 years after the first MMR dose, particularly for rubella and measles. Our results show that MMR vaccine-induced antibodies wane significantly after the second dose. According to epidemiological data, the protection induced by MMR vaccination in Finland seems to persist at least until early adulthood. However, the situation requires constant vigilance.

TI Differential Release and Phagocytosis of Tegument Glycoconjugates in
   Neurocysticercosis: Implications for Immune Evasion Strategies
AB Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is an infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by the metacestode of the helminth Taenia solium. The severity of the symptoms is associated with the intensity of the immune response. First, there is a long asymptomatic period where host immunity seems incapable of resolving the infection, followed by a chronic hypersensitivity reaction. Since little is known about the initial response to this infection, a murine model using the cestode Mesocestoides corti (syn. Mesocestoides vogae) was employed to analyze morphological changes in the parasite early in the infection. It was found that M. corti material is released from the tegument making close contact with the nervous tissue. These results were confirmed by infecting murine CNS with ex vivo-labeled parasites. Because more than 95% of NCC patients exhibit humoral responses against carbohydrate- based antigens, and the tegument is known to be rich in glycoconjugates (GCs), the expression of these types of molecules was analyzed in human, porcine, and murine NCC specimens. To determine the GCs present in the tegument, fluorochrome- labeled hydrazides as well as fluorochrome-labeled lectins with specificity to different carbohydrates were used. All the lectins utilized labeled the tegument. GCs bound by isolectinB4 were shed in the first days of infection and not resynthesized by the parasite, whereas GCs bound by wheat germ agglutinin and concavalinA were continuously released throughout the infectious process. GCs bound by these three lectins were taken up by host cells. Peanut lectin-binding GCs, in contrast, remained on the parasite and were not detected in host cells. The parasitic origin of the lectin- binding GCs found in host cells was confirmed using antibodies against T. solium and M. corti. We propose that both the rapid and persistent release of tegumental GCs plays a key role in the well-known immunomodulatory effects of helminths, including immune evasion and life-long inflammatory sequelae seen in many NCC patients.

TI An Analysis of Genetic Diversity and Inbreeding in Wuchereria bancrofti:
   Implications for the Spread and Detection of Drug Resistance
AB Estimates of genetic diversity in helminth infections of humans often have to rely on genotyping (immature) parasite transmission stages instead of adult worms. Here we analyse the results of one such study investigating a single polymorphic locus (a change at position 200 of the beta-tubulin gene) in microfilariae of the lymphatic filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. The presence of this genetic change has been implicated in benzimidazole resistance in parasitic nematodes of farmed ruminants. Microfilariae were obtained from patients of three West African villages, two of which were sampled prior to the introduction of mass drug administration. An individual-based stochastic model was developed showing that a wide range of allele frequencies in the adult worm populations could have generated the observed microfilarial genetic diversity. This suggests that appropriate theoretical null models are required in order to interpret studies that genotype transmission stages. Wright's hierarchical F-statistic was used to investigate the population structure in W. bancrofti microfilariae and showed significant deficiency of heterozygotes compared to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; this may be partially caused by a high degree of parasite genetic differentiation between hosts. Studies seeking to quantify accurately the genetic diversity of helminth populations by analysing transmission stages should increase their sample size to account for the variability in allele frequency between different parasite life-stages. Helminth genetic differentiation between hosts and non-random mating will also increase the number of hosts (and the number of samples per host) that need to be genotyped, and could enhance the rate of spread of anthelmintic resistance.

TI Isolations of Jamestown Canyon virus (Bunyaviridae : Orthobunyavirus)
   from field-collected mosquitoes (Diptera : Culicidae) in Connecticut,
   USA: A ten-year analysis, 1997-2006
AB Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) (Bunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus) is a mosquito-borne zoonosis belonging to the California serogroup. It has a wide geographic distribution, occurring throughout much of temperate North America. White-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus are the principal amplification hosts, and boreal Aedes and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes are the primary vectors. A 10-year study was undertaken to identify potential mosquito vectors in Connecticut, quantify seasonal prevalence rates of infection, and define the geographic distribution of JCV in the state as a function of land use and white-tailed deer populations, which have increased substantially over this period. Jamestown Canyon virus was isolated from 22 mosquito species. Five of them, Ochlerotatus canadensis, Oc. cantator, Anopheles punctipennis, Coquillettidia perturbans, and Oc. abserratus were incriminated as the most likely vectors, based on yearly isolation frequencies and the spatial geographic distribution of infected mosquitoes. Jamestown Canyon virus was isolated from Oc. canadensis more consistently and from a greater range of collection sites than any other species. Frequent virus isolations were also made from Aedes cinereus, Aedes vexans, and Oc. sticticus, and new North American isolation records were established for Anopheles walkeri, Culex restuans, Culiseta morsitans, Oc. sticticus, Oc. taeniorhynchus, and Psorophora ferox. Other species from which JCV was isolated included C. melanura, Oc. aurifer, Oc. communis, Oc. excrucians, Oc. provocans, Oc. sollicitans, Oc. stimulans, Oc. triseriatus, and Oc. trivittatus. Jamestown Canyon virus was widely distributed throughout Connecticut and found to consistently circulate in a diverse array of mosquito vectors. Infected mosquitoes were collected from June through September, and peak infection rates paralleled mosquito abundance from mid-June through mid-July. Infection rates in mosquitoes were consistent from year to year, and overall virus activity was directly related to local mosquito abundance. Infected mosquitoes were equally distributed throughout the state, irrespective of land use, and infection rates were not directly associated with the abundance of white-tailed deer, possibly because of their saturation throughout the region.

TI Investigating transmission in a two-wave epidemic of Chikungunya fever,
   Reunion Island
AB An epidemic of Chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, spectacularly swept through Reunion Island (population 780,000) in 2005-2006. There were 3000 cases in a first wave (March-June 2005) and more than 250,000 cases in a second (December 2005-April 2006). Adapting newly developed epidemiological tools to vector-borne diseases, we show that despite this massive difference in magnitude, the transmission potential as measured by the number of secondary cases per index case (or reproduction number), remained similar during the two consecutive waves: The best estimate for the initial reproduction number R-0 was 3.7, with a possible range from 2 to 11 depending on incubation duration and lifespan of the mosquito. We conclude that an increase in virulence between the two seasons was not necessary to explain the change in magnitude of the epidemics, and that the attack rate may be well over 50% in Chikungunya fever epidemics in the absence of intervention.

   (Myodes glareolus) Puumala virus infection in an area with low human
   incidence
AB In this study, the distribution of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection in local bank vole Myodes glareolus populations in an area with low human PUUV infection (nephropathia epidemica [NE]) incidence in northern Belgium was monitored for 2 consecutive years. Bank voles were trapped in preferred habitat and tested for anti-PUUV IgG. Infection data were related to individual bank vole features, population demography, and environmental variables. Rare occurrence of PUUV infection was found and PUUV prevalence was low compared with data from the high NE incidence area in southern Belgium. Small-scale climatic differences seemed to play a role in PUUV occurrence, vegetation index and deciduous forest patch size both influenced PUUV prevalence and number of infected voles in a positive way. The data suggested a density threshold in vole populations below which PUUV infection does not occur. This threshold may vary between years, but the abundance of bank voles does not seem to affect the degree of PUUV seroprevalence further. We found indications for a dilution effect on PUUV prevalence, dependent on the relative proportion of nonhost wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus in a study site. In conclusion, we regard the combination of a dilution effect, a possible threshold density that depends on local conditions, and a higher fragmentation of suitable bank vole habitat in our study area as plausible explanations for the sparse occurrence of PUUV infection and low prevalence detected. Thus, beside human activity patterns, local environmental conditions and rodent community structure are also likely to play a role in determining PUUV infection risk for humans.

TI Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus infections: A review of
   history, ecology, and predictive models, with implications for tropical
   northern Australia
AB The purpose of the present article is to present a review of the Ross River virus (RRV) and Barmah Forest virus (BFV) literature in relation to potential implications for future disease in tropical northern Australia. Ross River virus infection is the most common and most widespread arboviral disease in Australia, with an average of 4,800 national notifications annually. Of recent concern is the sudden rise in BFV infections; the 2005-2006 summer marked the largest BFV epidemic on record in Australia, with 1,895 notifications. Although not life-threatening, infection with either virus can cause arthritis, myalgia, and fatigue for 6 months or longer, resulting in substantial morbidity and economic impact. The geographic distribution of mosquito species and their seasonal activity is determined in large part by temperature and rainfall. Predictive models can be useful tools in providing early warning systems for epidemics of RRV and BFV infection. Various models have been developed to predict RRV outbreaks, but these appear to be mostly only regionally valid, being dependent on local ecological factors. Difficulties have arisen in developing useful models for the tropical northern parts of Australia, and to date no models have been developed for the Northern Territory. Only one model has been developed for predicting BFV infections using climate and tide variables. It is predicted that the exacerbation of current greenhouse conditions will result in longer periods of high mosquito activity in the tropical regions where RRV and BFV are already common. In addition, the endemic locations may expand further within temperate regions, and epidemics may become more frequent in those areas. Further development of predictive models should benefit public health planning by providing early warning systems of RRV and BFV infection outbreaks in different geographical locations.

TI Population dynamics and sex ratio of a parasitoid altered by
   fungal-infected diet of host butterfly
AB Variation of host quality affects population dynamics of parasitoids, even at the landscape scale. What causes host quality to vary and the subsequent mechanisms by which parasitoid population dynamics are affected can be complex. Here, we examine the indirect interaction of a plant pathogen with a parasitoid wasp. Under laboratory conditions, parasitoids from hosts fed fungus-infected plants weighed less than those from hosts fed uninfected plants,. indicating that the fungus causes the hosts to be of poor quality. However, parasitoids reared from hosts fed fungal-infected diet also tended to be female, a characteristic associated with high host quality. The pathogen, herbivore and parasitoid persist regionally as metapopulations in a shared landscape in A land, Finland. In an analysis of the metapopulation dynamics of the parasitoid over 6 years, the probability of colonization of a host population increased by more than twofold in patches occupied by the plant pathogen. While we cannot determine that the relationship is causal, a compelling explanation is that the plant pathogen facilitates the establishment by the parasitoid by increasing the fraction of female offspring. This is a novel mechanism of spatial multi-trophic level interactions.

TI How populations persist when asexuality requires sex: the spatial
   dynamics of coping with sperm parasites
AB The twofold cost of sex implies that sexual and asexual reproduction do not coexist easily. Asexual forms tend to outcompete sexuals but may eventually suffer higher extinction rates, creating tension between short- and long-term advantages of different reproductive modes. The 'short-sightedness' of asexual reproduction takes a particularly intriguing form in gynogenetic species complexes, in which an asexual species requires sperm from a related sexual host species to trigger embryogenesis. Asexuals are then predicted to outcompete their host, after which neither species can persist. We examine whether spatial structure can explain continued coexistence of the species complex, and assess the evidence based on data on the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa). A modification of the Levins metapopulation model creates two regions of good prospects for coexistence, connected by a region of poorer patch occupancy levels. In the first case, mate discrimination and/or niche differentiation keep local extinction rates low, and most patches contain both species; the other possibility resembles host-parasite dynamics where parasites frequently drive the host locally extinct. Several dynamical features are counterintuitive and relate to the parasitic nature of interactions in the species complex: for example, high local extinction rates of the asexual species can be beneficial for its own persistence. This creates a link from the evolution of sexual reproduction to that of prudent predation.

TI A quantitative test of the relationship between parasite dose and
   infection probability across different host-parasite combinations
AB Epidemiological models generally assume that the number of susceptible individuals that become infected within a unit of time depends on the density of the hosts and the concentration of parasites (i.e. mass-action principle). However, empirical studies have found significant deviations from this assumption due to biotic and abiotic factors, such as seasonality, the spatial structure of the host population and host heterogeneity with respect to immunity and susceptibility. In this paper, we examine the effect of the dose level of the bacterial endoparasite Pasteuria ramosa on the infection rate of its host, the water flea Daphnia magna. Using seven host clones and two parasite isolates, we measure the fraction of infected hosts after exposure to eight different parasite doses to determine whether there is variation in the infection process across different host clone-parasite isolate combinations. In five combinations, a pronounced dose-dependent infection pattern was found. Using a likelihood approach, we compare the infection data of these five combinations to the fit of three mathematical models: a mass-action model, a parasite antagonism model (i.e. an increase in the parasite dose leads to an under-proportionate increase in the infection rate per host) and a heterogeneous host model. We found that the host heterogeneity model, in which we assumed the existence of non-inherited phenotypic differences in host susceptibilities to the parasite, provides the best fit. Our analysis suggests that among 5 out of the 14 host clone-parasite isolate combinations that resulted in appreciable infections, non-genetic host heterogeneity plays an important role.

TI Reproduction and nutritional stress are risk factors for Hendra virus
   infection in little red flying foxes (Pteropus scapulatus)
AB Hendra virus (HeV) is a lethal paramyxovirus which emerged in humans in 1994. Poor understanding of HeV dynamics in Pteropus spp. (flying fox or fruit bat) reservoir hosts has limited our ability to determine factors driving its emergence. We initiated a longitudinal field study of HeV in little red flying foxes (LRFF; Pteropus scapulatus) and examined individual and population risk factors for infection, to determine probable modes of intraspecific transmission. We also investigated whether seasonal changes in host behaviour, physiology and demography affect host-pathogen dynamics. Data showed that pregnant and lactating females had significantly higher risk of infection, which may explain previously observed temporal associations between HeV outbreaks and flying fox birthing periods. Age-specific seroprevalence curves generated from field data imply that HeV is transmitted horizontally via faeces, urine or saliva. Rapidly declining seroprevalence between two field seasons suggests that immunity wanes faster in LRFF than in other flying fox species, and highlights the potentially critical role of this species in interspecific viral persistence. The highest seroprevalence was observed when animals showed evidence of nutritional stress, suggesting that environmental processes that alter flying fox food sources, such as habitat loss and climate change, may increase HeV infection and transmission. These insights into the ecology of HeV in flying fox populations suggest causal links between anthropogenic environmental change and HeV emergence.

TI Counter-intuitive developmental plasticity induced by host quality
AB Adaptation to different hosts plays a central role in the evolution of specialization and speciation in phytophagous insects and parasites, and our ability to experimentally rank hosts by their quality is critical to research to understand these processes. Here we provide a counter-intuitive example in which growth is faster on poor quality hosts. The leaf beetles Oreina elongata and Oreina cacaliae share their host plant with the rust Uromyces cacaliae. Larvae reared on infected Adenostyles alliariae show reduced growth rate, reduced maximum weight and longer development time. However, they normally respond adaptively to the rust's mid-season arrival. When switched during development from healthy to infected leaves, larvae accelerate growth and reduce development time, but pupate at lower body weight. In this novel plant insect-fungus interaction, infection forms the cue to trade off life-history traits in order to complete development within the brief alpine summer. It represents a novel mode of developmental plasticity, which is likely to be found in other host-parasite systems whenever host quality deteriorates due to multiple infection or ageing. This phenotypic plasticity would modify competition after co-infection and the mutual selection imposed by hosts and parasites, and creates a paradoxical negative correlation between growth rate and environmental quality.

TI Integrating genetic and epidemiological data to determine transmission
   pathways of foot-and-mouth disease virus
AB Estimating detailed transmission trees that reflect the relationships between infected individuals or populations during a disease outbreak often provides valuable insights into both the nature of disease transmission and the overall dynamics of the underlying epidemiological process. These trees may be based on epidemiological data that relate to the timing of infection and infectiousness, or genetic data that show the genetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from infected individuals. Genetic data are becoming increasingly important in the estimation of transmission trees of viral pathogens due to their inherently high mutation rate. Here, we propose a maximum-likelihood approach that allows epidemiological and genetic data to be combined within the same analysis to infer probable transmission trees. We apply this approach to data from 20 farms infected during the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, using complete viral genome sequences from each infected farm and information on when farms were first estimated to have developed clinical disease and when livestock on these farms were culled. Incorporating known infection links due to animal movement prior to imposition of the national movement ban results in the reduction of the number of trees from 41 472 that are consistent with the genetic data to 1728, of which just 4 represent more than 95% of the total likelihood calculated using a model that accounts for the epidemiological data. These trees differ in several ways from those constructed prior to the availability of genetic data.

TI Two arms are better than one: parasite variation leads to combined
   inducible and constitutive innate immune responses
AB Parasites represent a major threat to all organisms which has led to the evolution of an array of complex and effective defence mechanisms. Common to both vertebrates and invertebrates are innate immune mechanisms that can be either constitutively expressed or induced on exposure to infection. In nature, we find that a combination of both induced and constitutive responses are employed by vertebrates, invertebrates and, to an extent, plants when they are exposed to a parasite. Here we use a simple within-host model motivated by the insect immune system, consisting of both constitutive and induced responses, to address the question of why both types of response are maintained so ubiquitously. Generally, induced responses are thought to be advantageous because they are only used when required but are too costly to maintain constantly, while constitutive responses are advantageous because they are always ready to act. However, using a simple cost function but with no a priori assumptions about relative costs, we show that variability in parasite growth rates selects for a strategy that combines both constitutive and induced defences. Differential costs are therefore not necessary to explain the adoption of both forms of defence. Clearly, hosts are likely to be challenged by variable parasites in nature and this is sufficient to explain why it is optimal to deploy both arms of the innate immune system.

TI Evaluation of mosquito densoviruses for controlling Aedes aegypti
   (Diptera : Culicidae): Variation in efficiency due to virus strain and
   geographic origin of mosquitoes
AB Four mosquito densovirus strains were assayed for mortality and infectivity against Aedes aegypti larvae from different geographic regions. The viral titers were quantified by real-time PCR using TaqMan technology. First-instar larvae were exposed to the same titer of each densovirus strain for 48 hours. All strains of densoviruses exhibited larvicidal activity and caused more than 80% mortality and infectivity in the three mosquito strains. Aa/DNV-exposed larvae had the highest mortality rate. The mean time to death of Aa/DNV-exposed larvae was shorter than other DNVs-exposed larvae. We can conclude that different densovirus strains exhibit some variations in their pathogenicity to different populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. A few mosquitoes from Chachoengsao and Bangkok exposed to AeDNV and A ThDNV survived to the adult stage to lay eggs and showed 22% to 50% vertical transmission in the F1 generation. Phylogenetic analysis of four densovirus strains indicated that mosquito densoviruses are separated into two distinct clades.

TI Moving beyond common-garden and transplant designs: Insight into the
   causes of local adaptation in species interactions
AB Theoretical and empirical studies of local adaptation in species interactions have increased greatly over the past decade, yielding new insights into the conditions that favor local adaptation or maladaptation. Generalizing the results of these studies is difficult, however, because of the different experimental designs that have been used to infer local adaptation. Particularly challenging is comparing results across empirical studies conducted in a common laboratory or garden environment with results of those conducted using transplants in natural environments. Here we develop simple and easily interpretable mathematical expressions for the quantities measured by these two different types of studies. Our results reveal that common-garden designs measure only a single component of local adaptation - the spatial covariance between the genotype frequencies of the interacting species - and thus provide only a partial description of local adaptation. In contrast, reciprocal-transplant designs incorporate additional terms that measure the contribution of spatial variability in the ecological environment. Consequently, the two types of studies should yield identical results only when local adaptation is caused by spatial variability in the genotype frequencies of the interacting species alone. In order to unify these disparate approaches, we develop a new methodology that can be used to estimate the individual components of local adaptation. When implemented in an appropriate experimental system, this partitioning allows the examination of fundamental questions such as the relative proportion of local adaptation attributable to interactions between species or to the abiotic environment.

TI Pathogens promote plant diversity through a compensatory response
AB Pathogens are thought to promote diversity in plant communities by preventing competitive exclusion. Previous studies have focussed primarily on single-plant, single-pathogen interactions, yet the interactions between multiple pathogens and multiple hosts may have non-additive impacts on plant community composition. Here, we report that both a bacterial and a fungal pathogen maintained the diversity of a four-species plant community across five generations; however, significant interactions between the pathogens resulted in less plant diversity when the two pathogens were present than when the fungal pathogen was present alone. Standard models predict that pathogens will maintain plant diversity when they cause a disproportionate loss of fitness in the dominant plant species. In our experiment, however, pathogens maintained plant diversity because the rare species produced more seeds through a compensatory response to pathogen infection. Finally, we found that the influence of pathogens on maintaining plant diversity was 5.5 times greater than the influence of nutrient resource heterogeneity. Pathogens may be a major factor in maintaining plant diversity, and our findings emphasize the importance of investigating the roles of pathogens in natural plant communities.

TI Efficacy of aerial spraying of mosquito adulticide in reducing incidence
   of West Nile virus, California, 2005
AB Epidemic transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) in Sacramento County, California, in 2005 prompted aerial application of pyrethrin, a mosquito adulticide, over a large urban area. Statistical analyses of geographic information system datasets indicated that adulticiding reduced the number of human WNV cases within 2 treated areas compared with the untreated area of the county. When we adjusted for maximum incubation period of the virus from infection to onset of symptoms, no new cases were reported in either of the treated areas after adulticiding; 18 new cases were reported in the untreated area of Sacramento County during this time. Results indicated that the odds of infection after spraying were, approximate to 6x higher in the untreated area than in treated areas, and that the treatments successfully disrupted the WNV transmission cycle. Our results provide direct evidence that aerial mosquito adulticiding is effective in reducing human illness and potential death from WNV infection.

TI You can't keep a good parasite down: Evolution of a male-killer
   suppressor uncovers cytoplasmic incompatibility
AB Maternally inherited parasites are known to impose a wide variety of reproductive manipulations upon their host. These often produce strong selection on the host to suppress the parasite, resulting in a reduction in the frequency of the parasite. However, in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina, infected with a Wolbachia bacterium, field data demonstrate that suppression of the male-killing phenotype does not depress parasite frequency. Here we test and verify one hypothesis to explain this apparent paradox-Wolbachia induces a second phenotype, Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI), in populations where host suppression has evolved. We further demonstrate that the capacity to induce CI has not evolved de novo, but instead is instantaneously expressed upon the survival of infected males. The significance of these results is threefold: (1) multiple phenotypes can provide Wolbachia with the means to maintain itself in a host following suppression of a single manipulative phenotype; (2) the ability to induce CI can remain hidden in systems in which male-killing is observed, just as the ability to induce male-killing may be obscured in strains exhibiting CI; (3) the evolutionary maintenance of CI in a system in which it is not expressed suggests a functional link with male-killing or other traits under selection.

TI Seasonal variation in Plasmodium prevalence in a population of blue tits
   Cyanistes caeruleus
AB Seasonal variation in environmental conditions is ubiquitous and can affect the spread of infectious diseases. Understanding seasonal patterns of disease incidence can help to identify mechanisms, such as the demography of hosts and vectors, which influence parasite transmission dynamics.
   We examined seasonal variation in Plasmodium infection in a blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus population over 3 years using sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques, in light of Beaudoin et al.'s (1971; Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 7, 5-13) model of seasonal variation in avian malaria prevalence in temperate areas. This model predicts a within-year bimodal pattern of spring and autumn peaks with a winter absence of infection.
   Avian malaria infections were mostly Plasmodium (24.4%) with occasional Haemoproteus infections (0.8%). Statistical nonlinear smoothing techniques applied to longitudinal presence/absence data revealed marked temporal variation in Plasmodium prevalence, which apparently showed a within-year bimodal pattern similar to Beaudoin et al.'s model. However, of the two Plasmodium morphospecies accounting for most infections, only the seasonal pattern of Plasmodium circumflexum supported Beaudoin et al.'s model. On closer examination there was also considerable age structure in infection: Beaudoin et al.'s seasonal pattern was observed only in first year and not older birds. Plasmodium relictum prevalence was less seasonally variable.
   For these two Plasmodium morphospecies, we reject Beaudoin et al.'s model as it does not survive closer scrutiny of the complexities of seasonal variation among Plasmodium morphospecies and host age classes. Studies of host-parasite interactions should consider seasonal variation whenever possible. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of seasonal variation in disease prevalence.

TI Host defence mediates interspecific competition in ectoparasites
AB Interspecific competition influences which, how many and where species coexist in biological communities. Interactions between species in different trophic levels can mediate interspecific competition; e.g. predators are known to reduce competition between prey species by suppressing their population sizes. A parallel phenomenon may take place in host-parasite systems, with host defence mediating competition between parasite species.
   We experimentally investigated the impact of host defence (preening) on competitive interactions between two species of feather-feeding lice: 'wing' lice Columbicola columbae and 'body' lice Campanulotes compar. Both species are host-specific parasites that co-occur on rock pigeons Columba livia.
   We show that wing lice and body lice compete and that host defence mediates the magnitude of this competitive interaction.
   Competition is asymmetrical; wing louse populations are negatively impacted by body lice, but not vice versa. This competitive asymmetry is consistent with the fact that body lice predominate in microhabitats on the host's body that offer the most food and the most space.
   Our results indicate that host-defence-mediated competition can influence the structure of parasite communities and may play a part in the evolution of parasite diversity.

TI Fecundity of the autumnal moth depends on pooled geometrid abundance
   without a time lag: implications for cyclic population dynamics
AB The abundance and fecundity-related body size variation of the cyclic autumnal moth Epirrita autumnata were monitored from the early increase phase and throughout the outbreak to the end of the density decline in northernmost Norway during 1999-2006. Another geometrid, the winter moth Operophtera brumata, did not increase in density until the autumnal moth had its post-peak in 2004, and was at its own peak concurrent with the steeply declining autumnal moth abundance in 2005-06.
   The body size variables measured (forewing lengths of males and females and hind femur lengths of males) of the autumnal moth showed a similar density-dependent response, i.e. increasing density was associated with decreasing body size and fecundity. Nevertheless, regression analyses clearly ranked the pooled geometrid abundance without a time lag as the best predictor for the body size variation, ahead of the abundance of the autumnal moth or past abundance of all geometrids.
   Nondelayed effects of lowered food quality and absolute shortage of foliage under congested conditions are the most plausible reasons for reduced body size.
   Two most commonly proposed causal factors of the autumnal moth population cycle, i.e. delayed inducible resistance of the host plant (mountain birch Betula pubescens czerepanovii) and delayed density-dependent parasitism by specialized hymenopteran parasitoids, cannot easily explain the diverging population trends between the autumnal and winter moths.
   We suggest that either the inducible resistance of the host tree or the host utilization of the most important parasitoids and/or pathogens have to be strictly species-specific between these closely related moth species to produce the population dynamics observed. That fecundity of the autumnal moth was best related to the pooled geometrid abundance weakens support for the former hypothesis, while our lack of host-specific information limits conclusions about the role of natural enemies.

TI Experimental infection magnifies inbreeding depression in house mice
AB It is often assumed that inbreeding reduces resistance to pathogens, yet there are few experimental tests of this idea in vertebrates, and no tests for the effects of moderate levels of inbreeding more commonly found in nature. We mated wild-derived mice with siblings or first cousins and compared the resistance of their offspring to Salmonella infection with outbred controls under laboratory and seminatural conditions. In the laboratory, full-sib inbreeding reduced resistance to Salmonella and survivorship, whereas first-cousin inbreeding had no detectable effects. In competitive population enclosures, we found that first-cousin inbreeding reduced male fitness by 57% in infected vs. only 34% in noninfected control populations. Our study provides experimental evidence that inbreeding reduces resistance and ability to survive pathogenic infection, and moreover, it shows that even moderate inbreeding can cause significant fitness declines under naturalistic conditions of social stress, and especially with exposure to infectious agents.

TI Increasing productivity accelerates host-parasite coevolution
AB Host-parasite coevolution is believed to influence a range of evolutionary and ecological processes, including population dynamics, evolution of diversity, sexual reproduction and parasite virulence. The impact of coevolution on these processes will depend on its rate, which is likely to be affected by the energy flowing through an ecosystem, or productivity. We addressed how productivity affected rates of coevolution during a coevolutionary arms race between experimental populations of bacteria and their parasitic viruses (phages). As hypothesized, the rate of coevolution between bacterial resistance and phage infectivity increased with increased productivity. This relationship can in part be explained by reduced competitiveness of resistant bacteria in low compared with high productivity environments, leading to weaker selection for resistance in the former. The data further suggest that variation in productivity can generate variation in selection for resistance across landscapes, a result that is crucial to the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.

   molecule A, NKG2D, and transforming growth factor-beta in the liver of
   humans with alveolar echinococcosis: New actors in the tolerance to
   parasites?
AB Background. Echinococcus multilocularis growth and persistent granuloma, which lead to the development of the severe parasitic disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE), might be caused by abnormal expression of stress-induced proteins, with subsequent abnormalities in T cell activation. Similar to its involvement in tumors, the NKG2D-major histocompatability complex class I chain-related molecules A and B (MICA/B) signaling system could be involved in host-parasite interactions; however, its involvement in helminthic diseases has never been studied.
   Methods. Westudied MICA/B, NKG2D, and transforming growth factor-beta(TGF-beta) expression on liver sections and measured levels of soluble MICA in serum samples obtained from patients with progressive AE. Livers from healthy and cirrhotic subjects were studied as controls.
   Results. Expression of MICA/B proteins was strongly enhanced in the hepatocytes and endothelial and bile duct cells; in the CD68(+) cells of the periparasitic infiltrate, especially epithelioid and giant cells; and, also, in the metacestode germinal layer. Strong expression of MICA/B in the liver contrasted with low numbers of NK cells and lack of expression of NKG2D on the numerous CD8(+) T lymphocytes of the periparasitic infiltrate, as well as with the absence of soluble MICA in serum. TGF-beta was strongly expressed by most of the infiltrating lymphocytes.
   Conclusions. Sustained expression of MICA/B molecules and TGF-beta might lead to modulation of NKG2D with subsequent inhibition of NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity. Abnormalities of this signaling system could contribute to parasitic evasion of the host's immunity.

TI Microsatellite-based parentage analysis reveals non-ideal free
   distribution in a parasitoid population
AB Habitat selection by dispersers is the focus of much theoretical models, most of which are based on the assumption of negative density dependence. The archetype of these models is the ideal free distribution, characterized by an evolutionary stable state where more competitors aggregate in better habitats, so that the fitness benefit of resource abundance is equally offset by the cost of competition in all habitats. In this study, we used parentage analysis on microsatellite genotypes to test the ideal free distribution in a natural population of aphid parasitoids. Parentage analysis was conducted on parasitoids emerging from aphid colonies. We inferred the number of foundress females which had reproduced in each colony, as well as the number of offspring for each foundress. As predicted by the ideal free distribution, the number of offspring per foundress per colony did not depend on the number of hosts per colony. However, contrary to ideal free distribution predictions, it was affected by the number of foundresses per colony. In surprising contrast with the basic assumption of negative density dependence, individual fitness increased with the number of foundresses. Moreover, parentage analysis revealed a very low number of offspring per foundress per colony (mean = 1.8). This observed distribution questions the validity of classical models of habitat choice based on competition. Indeed, our results provide a new illustration reinforcing a growing body of theory and data on positive density dependence. Our results also suggest that the avoidance of hyperparasitism and predation, although generally neglected, may shape the distribution of parasitoids in the field.

TI Diverse historical processes shape deep phylogeographical divergence in
   the pollinating seed parasite Greya politella
AB Understanding the historical framework in which species interactions have diversified across landscapes may help to partition the effects of vicariance and geographically variable selection in shaping the geographical mosaic of coevolving species. We used phylogeographical analyses of the pollinating seed parasite Greya politella (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) to define the historical processes that may have structured interactions of this species with its host plants across major biogeographical breaks in western North America. Using 648 bp of cytochrome oxidase I and amplified fragment length polymorphisims, we identified deep genetic breaks among some populations consistent with some definitions of cryptic species. A combination of phylogenetic and population genetic approaches indicates that different historical processes may have structured G. politella genetic diversity in four regions: northern Pacific Northwest, southern Oregon, southern Sierra Nevada, and the remainder of California. The northern Pacific Northwest had high genetic diversity likely due to glacial refugia and subsequent spatial expansion, concordant with some other taxa. Populations in southern Oregon possessed unique, closely related haplotypes with restricted gene flow, possibly indicating a long-standing set of populations in this endemic-rich region. Analyses of California populations showed evidence of restricted gene flow and spatial expansion with many closely related haplotypes that occupy a broad geographical range. Southern Sierra Nevada populations were genetically distinct and highly diverse, possibly due to a localized glacial refugium. Together, these results suggest that vicariance and population expansion, possibly in combination with geographically variable selection, have shaped the diversification of G. politella and its interactions with its host plants.

TI Do mosquitoes filter the access of Plasmodium cytochrome b lineages to
   an avian host?
AB Many parasites show fidelity to a set of hosts in ecological time but not evolutionary time and the determinants of this pattern are poorly understood. Malarial parasites use vertebrate hosts for the asexual stage of their life cycle but use Dipteran hosts for the sexual stage. Despite the potential evolutionary importance of Dipteran hosts, little is known of their role in determining a parasite's access to vertebrate hosts. Here, we use an avian malarial system in Panama to explore whether mosquitoes act as an access filter that limits the range of vertebrate hosts used by particular parasite lineages. We amplified and sequenced Plasmodium mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Turdus grayi (clay-coloured robin) and from mosquitoes at the same study site. We trapped and identified to species 123 141 female mosquitoes and completed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for Plasmodium parasites in 435 pools of 20 mosquitoes per pool (8700 individuals total) spanning the 11 most common mosquito species. Our primers amplified nine Plasmodium lineages, whose sequences differed by 1.72%-10.0%. Phylogenetic analyses revealed partial clustering of lineages that co-occurred in mosquito hosts. However PAN3 and PAN6, the two primary parasite lineages of T. grayi, exhibited sequence divergence of 8.59% and did not cluster in the phylogeny. We detected these two lineages exclusively in mosquitoes from different genera - PAN3 was found only in Culex (Melanoconion) ocossa, and PAN6 was found only in Aedeomyia squamipennis. Furthermore, each of these two parasite lineages co-occurred in mosquitoes with other Plasmodium lineages that were not found in the vertebrate host T. grayi. Together, this evidence suggests that parasite-mosquito associations do not restrict the access of parasites to birds but instead may actually facilitate the switching of vertebrate hosts that occurs over evolutionary time.

TI Viral population estimation using pyrosequencing
AB The diversity of virus populations within single infected hosts presents a major difficulty for the natural immune response as well as for vaccine design and antiviral drug therapy. Recently developed pyrophosphate-based sequencing technologies (pyrosequencing) can be used for quantifying this diversity by ultra-deep sequencing of virus samples. We present computational methods for the analysis of such sequence data and apply these techniques to pyrosequencing data obtained from HIV populations within patients harboring drug-resistant virus strains. Our main result is the estimation of the population structure of the sample from the pyrosequencing reads. This inference is based on a statistical approach to error correction, followed by a combinatorial algorithm for constructing a minimal set of haplotypes that explain the data. Using this set of explaining haplotypes, we apply a statistical model to infer the frequencies of the haplotypes in the population via an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We demonstrate that pyrosequencing reads allow for effective population reconstruction by extensive simulations and by comparison to 165 sequences obtained directly from clonal sequencing of four independent, diverse HIV populations. Thus, pyrosequencing can be used for cost-effective estimation of the structure of virus populations, promising new insights into viral evolutionary dynamics and disease control strategies.

TI High Levels of Genetic Differentiation between Ugandan Glossina fuscipes
   fuscipes Populations Separated by Lake Kyoga
AB Background: Glossina fuscipes fuscipes is the major vector of human African trypanosomiasis, commonly referred to as sleeping sickness, in Uganda. In western and eastern Africa, the disease has distinct clinical manifestations and is caused by two different parasites: Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense. Uganda is exceptional in that it harbors both parasites, which are separated by a narrow 160-km belt. This separation is puzzling considering there are no restrictions on the movement of people and animals across this region.
   Methodology and Results: We investigated whether genetic heterogeneity of G. f. fuscipes vector populations can provide an explanation for this disjunct distribution of the Trypanosoma parasites. Therefore, we examined genetic structuring of G. f. fuscipes populations across Uganda using newly developed microsatellite markers, as well as mtDNA. Our data show that G. f. fuscipes populations are highly structured, with two clearly defined clusters that are separated by Lake Kyoga, located in central Uganda. Interestingly, we did not find a correlation between genetic heterogeneity and the type of Trypanosoma parasite transmitted.
   Conclusions: The lack of a correlation between genetic structuring of G. f. fuscipes populations and the distribution of T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense indicates that it is unlikely that genetic heterogeneity of G. f. fuscipes populations explains the disjunct distribution of the parasites. These results have important epidemiological implications, suggesting that a fusion of the two disease distributions is unlikely to be prevented by an incompatibility between vector populations and parasite.

   cultivation in the Americas
AB The domestication of crops and the development of agricultural societies not only brought about major changes in human interactions with the environment but also in plants' interactions with the diseases that challenge them. We evaluated the impact of the domestication of maize from teosinte and the widespread cultivation of maize on the historical demography of Ustilago maydis, a fungal pathogen of maize. To determine the evolutionary response of the pathogen's populations, we obtained multilocus genotypes for 1088 U. maydis diploid individuals from two teosinte subspecies in Mexico and from maize in Mexico and throughout the Americas. Results identified five major U. maydis populations: two in Mexico; two in South America; and one in the United States. The two populations in Mexico diverged from the other populations at times comparable to those for the domestication of maize at 6000-10000 years before present. Maize domestication and agriculture enforced sweeping changes in U. maydis populations such that the standing variation in extant pathogen populations reflects evolution only since the time of the crop's domestication.

TI Genetic variation and covariation of susceptibility to parasitoids in
   the aphid Myzus persicae: no evidence for trade-offs
AB Parasitoids are an important mortality factor for insects. Susceptibility to parasitoids should thus be under strong negative selection. Nevertheless, ample genetic variation for susceptibility to parasitoids is commonly observed in natural populations, suggesting that trade-offs may constrain the evolution of reduced susceptibility. This can be studied by assessing genetic variation for susceptibility and its covariation with other components of fitness. In a set of 17 clones of the peach potato aphid, Myzus persicae, for which good estimates of heritable variation for life-history traits were available, we found significant clonal variation for susceptibility to two of their common parasitoids: Aphidius colemani and Diaeretiella rapae. One clone, the only one harbouring a facultative endosymbiotic bacterium, Regiella insecticola, was entirely resistant to both parasitoids. Susceptibilities to the two parasitoids exhibited a positive genetic correlation close to unity, implying a general mechanism of defence. However, the susceptibility to parasitoids was uncorrelated to the clones' fecundity or rate of increase, providing no evidence for costs of the ability to resist parasitoids.

TI Reduced mother-to-child transmission of HIV associated with infant but
   not maternal GB virus C infection
AB Background. Prolonged coinfection with GB virus C (GBV-C) has been associated with improved survival in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults. We investigated whether maternal or infant GBV-C infection was associated with mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 infection.
   Methods. The study population included 1364 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled in 3 studies of MTCT of HIV in Bangkok, Thailand (the studies were conducted from 1992-1994, 1996-1997, and 1999-2004, respectively). We tested plasma collected from pregnant women at delivery for GBV-C RNA, GBV-C antibody, and GBV-C viral genotype. If GBV-CRNA was detected in the maternal samples, the 4- or 6-month infant sample was tested for GBV-C RNA. The rates of MTCT of HIV among GBV-C-infected women and infants were compared with the rates among women and infants without GBV-C infection.
   Results. The prevalence of GBV-C RNA in maternal samples was 19%. Of 245 women who were GBV-C RNA positive, 101 (41%) transmitted GBV-C to their infants. Of 101 infants who were GBV-C RNA positive, 2 (2%) were infected with HIV, compared with 162 (13%) of 1232 infants who were GBV-C RNA negative (odds ratio [OR] adjusted for study, 0.13 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.03-0.54]). This association remained after adjustment for maternal HIV viral load, receipt of antiretroviral prophylaxis, CD4(+) count, and other covariates. MTCT of HIV was not associated with the presence of GBV-C RNA (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.62-1.42]) or GBV-C antibody (aOR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.54-1.50]) in maternal samples.
   Conclusions. Reduced MTCT of HIV was significantly associated with infant acquisition of GBV-C but not with maternal GBV-C infection. The mechanism for this association remains unknown.

TI HIV-1 tropism and survival in vertically infected Ugandan infants
AB Background. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) may utilize the CXCR4 coreceptor (X4 virus), the CCR5 coreceptor (R5 virus), or both (dual/mixed [DM] virus). We analyzed HIV-1 coreceptor tropism in Ugandan infants enrolled in the HIVNET (HIV Network for Prevention Trials) 012 trial.
   Methods. Plasma or serum was analyzed using a commercial coreceptor tropism assay. HIV env subtype was determined by phylogenetic methods.
   Results. Tropism results were obtained for 57 samples from infants collected 6-14 weeks after birth. Fifty-two infants had only R5 virus, and 5 had either X4 or DM virus. The mothers of those 5 infants also had X4 or DM virus. In infants, subtype D infection was associated with high-level infectivity in CCR5-bearing cells and also with the detection of X4 or DM strains. High-level infectivity in CCR5-bearing cells was associated with decreased infant survival, but infection with X4 or DM virus was not. HIV clones from infants with DM viral populations showed different patterns of coreceptor use. V3 loop sequence-based algorithms predicted the tropism of some, but not all, env clones.
   Conclusions. Complex patterns of HIV tropism were found in HIV-infected newborn infants. Subtype D infection was associated with X4 virus and with high-level replication in CCR5-bearing cells. High-level replication of R5 virus was associated with decreased infant survival.

TI Coinfection with herpes simplex virus type 2 is associated with reduced
   HIV-specific T cell responses and systemic immune activation
AB Background. Chronic coinfection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with an increased HIV viral load and more rapid disease progression, perhaps related to HSV-2 -associated alterations in host immunity.
   Methods. Studies were nested within (1) a cross-sectional study of men coinfected with HIV and HSV-2 and (2) women not infected with HIV, both before and after HSV-2 acquisition. HSV-2 infection status was determined by ELISA. HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell epitopes were mapped, and proliferation of HIV-specific cells was also assessed. Systemic inflammatory and regulatory T cell populations were assayed by flow cytometry.
   Results. The breadth of both the HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell interferon-gamma and proliferative responses was reduced in participants coinfected with HIV and HSV-2, independent of the HIV plasma viral load and CD4(+) T cell count, and the magnitude of the responses was also reduced. HSV-2 infection in this group was associated with increased T cell CD38 expression but not with differences in the proportion of CD4(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells. However, in women not infected with HIV, acquisition of HSV-2 was associated with an increase in the proportion of regulatory T cells.
   Conclusions. HSV-2 coinfection was associated with reduced HIV-specific T cell responses and systemic inflammation. The immune effects of HSV-2 may underlie the negative impact that this coinfection has on the clinical course of HIV infection.

AB The rise of drug resistance remains a major impediment to the treatment of some diseases caused by fast-evolving pathogens that undergo genetic mutations. Models describing the within-host infectious dynamics suggest that the resistance is unlikely to emerge if the pathogen-specific immune responses are maintained above a certain threshold during therapy. However, emergence of resistance in the population involves both within-host and between-host infection mechanisms. Here, we employ a mathematical model to identify an effective treatment strategy for the management of drug resistance in the population. We show that, in the absence of pre-existing immunity, the population-wide spread of drug-resistant pathogen strains can be averted if a sizable portion of susceptible hosts is depleted before drugs are used on a large scale. The findings, based on simulations for influenza infection as a case study, suggest that the initial prevalence of the drug-sensitive strain under low pressure of drugs, followed by a timely implementation of intensive treatment, can minimize the total number of infections while preventing outbreaks of drug-resistant infections.

TI CD4(+)T cells do not mediate within-host competition between genetically
   diverse malaria parasites
AB Ecological interactions between microparasite populations in the same host are an important source of selection on pathogen traits such as virulence and drug resistance. In the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice, parasites that are more virulent can competitively suppress less virulent parasites in mixed infections. There is evidence that some of this suppression is due to immune-mediated apparent competition, where an immune response elicited by one parasite population suppress the population density of another. This raises the question whether enhanced immunity following vaccination would intensify competitive interactions, thus strengthening selection for virulence in Plasmodium populations. Using the P. chabaudi model, we studied mixed infections of virulent and avirulent genotypes in CD4(+)T cell-depleted mice. Enhanced efficacy of CD4(+)T cell-dependent responses is the aim of several candidate malaria vaccines. We hypothesized that if immune-mediated interactions were involved in competition, removal of the CD4(+)T cells would alleviate competitive suppression of the avirulent parasite. Instead, we found no alleviation of competition in the acute phase, and significant enhancement of competitive suppression after parasite densities had peaked. Thus, the host immune response may actually be alleviating other forms of competition, such as that over red blood cells. Our results suggest that the CD4(+)-dependent immune response, and mechanisms that act to enhance it such as vaccination, may not have the undesirable affect of exacerbating within-host competition and hence the strength of this source of selection for virulence.

TI Cryptosporidium muris in a Texas canine population
AB Molecular technology has led to the discovery of previously unrecognized Cryptosporidium species in new hosts, such as C. canis in humans. The notion that dogs may transmit Cryptosporidium species to humans has significant public health implications, and additional studies are merited. The purpose of this study was to examine a group of kenneled dogs to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium species infection and to identify parasite species. Prevalence of active infection was 71%. Six positive samples were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to identify the Cryptosporidium species. Restriction digest patterns identified C. muris as the infecting species in all six dogs; species identity was confirmed by genetic sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a naturally occurring C. muris infection in a canine host. The finding of C muris in asymptomatic canines supports the notion of dogs as potential sources of human infection.

TI Early-phase transmission of Yersinia pestis by cat fleas
   (Ctenocephalides felis) and their potential role as vectors in a
   plague-endemic region of Uganda
AB In recent decades, the majority of human plague cases (caused by Yersinia pestis) have been reported from Africa. In northwest Uganda, which has had recent plague outbreaks, cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) have been reported as the most common fleas in the home environment, which is suspected to be a major exposure site for human plague in this country. In the past, C. felis has been viewed as only a nuisance-biting insect because limited laboratory studies suggested it is incapable of transmitting Y. pestis or is an inefficient vector. Our laboratory study shows that C. felis is a competent vector of plague bacteria, but that efficiency is low compared with another flea species collected in the same area: the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. On the other hand, despite its low vector efficiency, C felis is the most common flea in human habitations in a plague-endemic region of Uganda (Arua and Nebbi Districts), and occasionally infests potential rodent reservoirs of Y. pestis such as the roof rat (Rattus rattus) or the Nile rat (Arvicanthis niloticus). Plague control programs in this region should remain focused on reducing rat flea populations, although our findings imply that cat fleas should not be ignored by these programs as they could play a significant role as secondary vectors.

TI The basic reproduction number for complex disease systems: Defining R-0
   for tick-borne infections
AB Characterizing the basic reproduction number, R-0, for many wildlife disease systems can seem a complex problem because several species are involved, because there are different epidemiological reactions to the infectious agent at different life-history stages, or because there are multiple transmission routes. Tick-borne diseases are an important example where all these complexities are brought together as a result of the peculiarities of the tick life cycle and the multiple transmission routes that occur. We show here that one can overcome these complexities by separating the host population into epidemiologically different types of individuals and constructing a matrix of reproduction numbers, the so-called next-generation matrix. Each matrix element is an expected number of infectious individuals of one type produced by a single infectious individual of a second type. The largest eigenvalue of the matrix characterizes the initial exponential growth or decline in numbers of infected individuals. Values below 1 therefore imply that the infection cannot establish. The biological interpretation closely matches that of for disease systems with only one type of individual and R-0 where infection is directly transmitted. The parameters defining each matrix element have a clear biological meaning. We illustrate the usefulness and power of the approach with a detailed examination of tick-borne diseases, and we use field and experimental data to parameterize the next-generation matrix for Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses of the matrices, at the element and individual parameter levels, allow direct comparison of the two etiological agents. This provides further support that transmission between cofeeding ticks is critically important for the establishment of tick-borne encephalitis.

TI Echinococcosis in China, a review of the epidemiology of Echinococcus
   spp.
AB Cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) are highly significant infectious diseases occurring worldwide and caused by metacestodes of tapeworms Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis, respectively. Both human CE and AE have highest prevalence rates in western and northwestern China. Livestock is the main intermediate host of E. granulosus, and wild small mammal are the main intermediate hosts of E. multilocularis. Since they range freely in pastoral areas, prey on wild small mammals and offal of livestock after slaughter, and have close relationships with humans, domestic dogs are the most important definitive host of both Echinococcus spp. with the highest risk of transmitting CE and AE to humans. Pastoralism is the occupation with the highest risk of being infected with the both kinds of echinococcosis due to the proximity of livestock, dogs, and wildlife host species. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology of human echinococcosis, the situation of parasite transmission in animal hosts, and possible transmission patterns in China. In addition, human activities and their potential influence on the transmission of echinococcosis are also discussed.

TI Parasite facilitates plant species coexistence in a coastal wetland
AB Outbreaks of infectious agents in natural ecosystems are on the rise. Understanding host-pathogen interactions and their impact on community composition may be central to the conservation of biological diversity. Infectious agents can convey both exploitive and facilitative effects that regulate host populations and community structure. Parasitic angiosperms are highly conspicuous in many plant communities, and they provide a tractable model for understanding parasite effects in multispecies communities. I examined host identity and variation in host infectivity of a holoparasitic vine (Cuscuta salina) within a California salt marsh. In a two-year parasite removal experiment, I measured the effect of C. salina on its most frequent host, a rare hemiparasite, and the plant community. C. salina clearly suppressed the dominant host, but rare plant fitness and plant species diversity were enhanced through indirect effects. Priority effects played a role in the strength of the outcome due to the timing of life history characteristics. The differential influence of parasites on the fecundity of multiple hosts can change population dynamics, benefit rare species, and alter community structure. The continuum of negative to positive consequences of parasitic interactions deserves more attention if we are to understand community dynamics and successfully restore tidal wetlands.

TI Life-history trade-offs influence disease in changing climates:
   Strategies of an amphibian pathogen
AB Life-history trade-offs allow many animals to maintain reproductive fitness across a range of climatic conditions. When used by parasites and pathogens, these strategies may influence patterns of disease in changing climates. The chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is linked to global declines of amphibian populations. Short-term growth in culture is maximal at 17 degrees-25 degrees C. This has been used in an argument that global warming, which increases the time that amphibians spend at these temperatures in cloud-covered montane environments, has led to extinctions. Here we show that the amphibian chytrid responds to decreasing temperatures with trade-offs that increase fecundity as maturation rate slows and increase infectivity as growth decreases. At 17 degrees-25 degrees C, infectious zoospores encyst (settle and develop a cell wall) and develop into the zoospore-producing stage (zoosporangium) faster, while at 7 degrees-10 degrees C, greater numbers of zoospores are produced per zoosporangium; these remain infectious for a longer period of time. We modeled the population growth of B. dendrobatidis through time at various temperatures using delayed differential equations and observational data for four parameters: developmental rate of thalli, fecundity, rate of zoospore encystment, and rate of zoospore survival. From the models, it is clear that life-history trade-offs allow B. dendrobatidis to maintain a relatively high long-term growth rate at low temperatures, so that it maintains high fitness across a range of temperatures. When a seven-day cold shock is simulated, the outcome is intermediate between the two constant temperature regimes, and in culture, a sudden drop in temperature induces zoospore release. These trade-offs can be ecologically important for a variety of organisms with complex life histories, including pathogenic microorganisms. The effect of temperature on amphibian mortality will depend on the interaction between fungal growth and host immune function and will be modified by host ecology, behavior, and life history. These results demonstrate that B. dendrobatidis populations can grow at high rates across a broad range of environmental temperatures and help to explain why it is so successful in cold montane environments.

TI Hierarchical dose response of E-coli O157 : H7 from human outbreaks
   incorporating heterogeneity in exposure
AB The infectivity of pathogenic microorganisms is a key factor in the transmission of an infectious disease in a susceptible population. Microbial infectivity is generally estimated from dose-response studies in human volunteers. This can only be done with mildly pathogenic organisms. Here a hierarchical Beta-Poisson dose-response model is developed utilizing data from human outbreaks. On the lowest level each outbreak is modelled separately and these are then combined at a second level to produce a group dose-response relation. The distribution of foodborne pathogens often shows strong heterogeneity and this is incorporated by introducing an additional parameter to the dose-response model, accounting for the degree of overdispersion relative to Poisson distribution. It Was found that heterogeneity considerably influences the shape of the dose-response relationship and increases uncertainty in predicted risk. This uncertainty is greater than previously reported surrogate and outbreak models using a single level of analysis. Monte Carlo parameter samples (alpha, beta of the Beta-Poisson model) can be readily incorporated in risk assessment models built using tools Such LIS S-plus and @Risk.

TI Seasonal influenza in the United States, France, and Australia:
   transmission and prospects for control
AB Recurrent epidemics of influenza are observed seasonally around the world with considerable health and economic consequences. A key quantity for the control of infectious diseases is the reproduction number, which measures the transmissibility of a pathogen and determines the magnitude of public health interventions necessary to control epidemics. Here we applied a simple epidemic model to weekly indicators Of influenza mortality to estimate the reproduction numbers of seasonal influenza epidemics spanning three decades in the United States, France, and Australia.. We found similar distributions of reproduction number estimates in the three countries, with mean Value 1 center dot 3 and important year-to-year variability (range 0 center dot 9-2 center dot 1). Estimates derived from two different mortality indicators (pneumonia and influenza excess deaths and influenza-specific deaths) were in close agreement for the United States (correlation=0 center dot 61, P<0 center dot 001) and France (correlation =07 center dot 9, P<0 center dot 001), but not Australia. Interestingly, high prevalence of A/H3N2 influenza viruses was associated with high transmission seasons (P=0 center dot 006), while B Viruses were more prevalent in low transmission seasons (P = 0 center dot 004). The Current vaccination strategy targeted at people at highest risk of severe disease Outcome IS suboptimal because Current vaccines are poorly immunogenic in these Population groups. Our results Suggest that interrupting transmission of seasonal influenza would require a relatively high vaccination coverage (>60 in healthy individuals who respond well to vaccine, in addition to periodic re-vaccination due to evolving viral antigens and waning Population immunity.

TI Rapid speciation following recent host shifts in the plant pathogenic
   fungus Rhynchosporium
AB Agriculture played a significant role in increasing the number of pathogen species and in expanding their geographic range during the last 10,000 years. We tested the hypothesis that a fungal pathogen of cereals and grasses emerged at the time of domestication of cereals in the Fertile Crescent and subsequently speciated after adaptation to its hosts. Rhynchosporium secalis, originally described from rye, causes an important disease on barley called scald, although it also infects other species of Hordeum and Agropyron. Phylogenetic analyses based on four DNA sequence loci identified three host-associated lineages that were confirmed by cross-pathogenicity tests. Bayesian analyses of divergence time suggested that the three lineages emerged between similar to 1200 to 3600 years before present (B.P.) with a 95% highest posterior density ranging from 100 to 12,000 years B.P. depending on the implemented clock models. The coalescent inference of demographic history revealed a very recent population expansion for all three pathogens. We propose that Rhynchosporium on barley, rye, and Agropyron host species represent three cryptic pathogen species that underwent independent evolution and ecological divergence by host-specialization. We postulate that the recent emergence of these pathogens followed host shifts. The subsequent population expansions followed the expansion of the cultivated host populations and accompanying expansion of the weedy Agropyron spp. found in fields of cultivated cereals. Hence, agriculture played a major role in the emergence of the scald diseases, the adaptation of the pathogens to new hosts and their worldwide dissemination.

TI Synergism between entomopathogenic nematodes and Bacillus thuringiensis
   crops: integrating biological control and resistance management
AB 1. The past decade has witnessed a continual increase in the use of crops genetically modified to produce insecticidal toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This presents the challenge of designing agricultural systems to manage pests and the evolution of resistance to Bt.
   2. We tested whether entomopathogenic nematodes might act synergistically with Bt crops by killing pests in non-Bt refuges and by increasing the fitness costs of resistance to Bt. We also tested whether insect mortality and fitness costs were affected by the cotton phytochemical gossypol.
   3. The entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema riobrave increased the fitness cost of Bt resistance, indicating that its presence in refuges may slow pest adaptation to Bt crops. No effect on fitness costs was detected for the nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. Gossypol did not alter nematode-imposed fitness costs.
   4. Simulation modelling supported the hypothesis that nematodes in refuges may slow resistance evolution.
   5. The effects of gossypol on insect mortality from nematodes and nematode reproduction differed between nematode species. Gossypol increased insect mortality caused by H. bacteriophora but did not affect mortality caused by S. riobrave. Gossypol enhanced reproduction of H. bacteriophora and decreased reproduction of S. riobrave.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results point to the value of developing integrated pest management strategies for Bt crops that include non-Bt refuges in which entomopathogenic nematodes are used as a pest-management agent. Because entomopathogenic nematodes can magnify fitness costs of Bt resistance, their presence in refuges may delay resistance by pests to Bt crops. Moreover, entomopathogenic nematodes can serve as biological control agents thereby decreasing dependence on conventional insecticides to manage pest populations in refuges.

TI West Nile virus antibodies in permanent resident and overwintering
   migrant birds in south-central Kansas
AB We conducted serological studies, using epitope-blocking ELISAs directed at West Nile virus (WNV) and flavivirus antibodies, of wild birds in south-central Kansas, the first for this state, in the winters of 2003-04 through 2005-06. Overwintering migratory species (primarily the American tree sparrow and dark-eyed junco) consistently showed significantly lower seropositivity than permanent residents (primarily the northern cardinal). The cardinal showed annual variation in seropositivity between winters. Of 35 birds that were serial sampled within a single winter, one cardinal may have seroconverted between late December and mid-February, providing a preliminary suggestion of continued enzootic transmission, chronic infection, or bird-bird transfer as overwintering mechanisms. Breeding population size of the cardinal did not change after the introduction of WNV to Kansas. Of eighteen birds that were serial sampled between winters, none seroconverted. Among overwintering migrants, the Harris' Sparrow showed the highest seropositivity, possibly related to its migration route through the central Great Plains, an area of recent high WNV activity. The finding that permanent resident birds exhibit higher seropositivity than migrant birds suggests that resident birds contribute to the initiation of annual infection cycles, although this conclusion is speculative in the absence of data on viral titers and the length of viremia.

TI No evidence of deer mouse involvement in plague (Yersinia pestis)
   epizootics in prairie dogs
AB Plague, the disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, can have devastating impacts on black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys Indovicianus) colonies. One suggested mechanism behind sporadic prairie dog die-offs involves an alternative mammal host, such as the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), which often inhabits prairie dog colonies. We examined the flea populations of deer mice to investigate the potential of flea-borne transmission of plague between deer mice and prairie dogs in northern Colorado, where plague is active in prairie dog colonies. Deer mice were predominantly infested with the flea Aetheca wagneri, and were rarely infested with prairie dog fleas, Oropsylla hirsuta. Likelihood of flea infestation increased with average monthly temperature, and flea loads were higher in reproductive animals. These results suggest that the deer mouse is an unlikely maintenance host of plague in this region.

   Greece
AB Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) are viruses in the Mammalian tick-borne virus group/genus Flavivirus, causing central nervous system disease. Greek goat encephalitis virus (GGEV), which was isolated from the brain of a newborn goat with neurological symptoms, is currently classified in the TBEV group. The vector of GGEV has not yet been specifically identified but is considered likely to be Ixodes ricinus. A total of 3,144 Ixodidae ticks collected during 2003-2006 from goats and sheep in rural areas of Northern Greece were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of TBEV-specific RNA. Two pools of I. ricinus ticks were shown to be RNA-positive. Sequence analysis showed that the virus was GGEV. The RNA-positive ticks were detected in regions where high prevalence of TBE antibodies in humans was present. Prevalence in ticks varied according to year, season, and geographic region. TBEV is not endemic in Greece, and most probably the seroprevalence of TBE antibodies in humans is due to cross-reactivity to GGEV.

TI Oropsylla hirsuta (Siphonaptera : Ceratophyllidae) can support plague
   epizootics in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) by
   early-phase transmission of Yersinia pestis
AB Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia Pestis, often leads to rapid decimation of black-tailed prairie dog colonies. Flea-borne transmission of Y. pestis has been thought to occur primarily via blocked fleas, and therefore studies of vector efficiency have focused on the period when blockage is expected to occur (>= 5 days post-infection [p.i.]). Oropsylla hirsuta, a prairie dog flea, rarely blocks and transmission is inefficient >= 5 days p.i.; thus, this flea has been considered incapable of explaining rapid dissemination of Y. pestis among prairie dogs. By infecting wild-caught fleas with Y. pestis and exposing naive mice to groups of fleas at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h p.i., we examined the early-phase (1-4 days p.i.) efficiency of O. hirsuta to transmit Y. pestis to hosts and showed that O. hirsuta is a considerably more efficient vector at this largely overlooked stage (5.19% of fleas transmit Y. pestis at 24 h p.i.) than at later stages. Using a model of vectorial capacity, we suggest that this level of transmission can support plague at an enzootic level in a population when flea loads are within the average observed for black-tailed prairie dogs in nature. Shared burrows and sociality of prairie dogs could lead to accumulation of fleas when host population is reduced as a result of the disease, enabling epizootic spread of plague among prairie dogs.

TI Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in
   individualism/collectivism
AB Pathogenic diseases impose selection pressures on the social behaviour of host populations. In humans (Homo sapiens), many psychological phenomena appear to serve an antipathogen defence function. One broad implication is the existence of cross-cultural differences in human cognition and behaviour contingent upon the relative presence of pathogens in the local ecology. We focus specifically on one fundamental cultural variable: differences in individualistic versus collectivist values. We suggest that specific behavioural manifestations of collectivism (e.g. ethnocentrism, conformity) can inhibit the transmission of pathogens; and so we hypothesize that collectivism (compared with individualism) will more often characterize cultures in regions that have historically had higher prevalence of pathogens. Drawing on epidemiological data and the findings of worldwide cross-national surveys of individualism/collectivism, our results support this hypothesis: the regional prevalence of pathogens has a strong positive correlation with cultural indicators of collectivism and a strong negative correlation with individualism. The correlations remain significant even when controlling for potential confounding variables. These results help to explain the origin of a paradigmatic cross-cultural difference, and reveal previously undocumented consequences of pathogenic diseases on the variable nature of human societies.

   factors associated with herpes simplex virus type 2 infection in

AB Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections, and it increases the risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 at least twofold. Individual-level factors are insufficient to explain geographic and population variation in HSV-2, suggesting the need to identify ecologic factors. The authors sought to determine the geographic prevalence and community-level factors associated with HSV-2 after controlling for individual-level factors among slums in Chennai, India. From March to June 2001, participants aged 18-40 years voluntarily completed a survey and were tested for HSV-2. Community characteristics were assessed through interviews with key informants and other secondary data sources. Multilevel nonlinear analysis was conducted. Eighty-five percent of eligible persons completed the survey; of these, 98% underwent HSV-2 testing, producing a final sample of 1,275. Participants were of Tamil ethnicity, were predominantly female and married, and were on average 30 years old. Fifteen percent were infected with HSV-2, and there was significant variation in HSV-2 prevalence among communities. After controlling for individual-level factors, the authors identified community-level factors, including socioeconomic status and the presence of injection drug users, that were independently associated with HSV-2 and explained 11% of the variance in prevalence. Future studies are needed to test mechanisms through which these community-level factors may be operating.

The impact on malaria indicators was assessed, and the potential additional effect of nets evaluated. After the intervention-and compared with the control valleys-children 1-9 years old in the treated valleys had lower risks of malaria infection (odds ratio, OR: 0.55), high parasite density (OR: 0.48), and clinical malaria (OR: 0.57). The impact on malaria prevalence was even higher in infants (OR: 0.14). Using nets did not confer an additional protective effect to spraying. Targeted vector control had a major impact on malaria in the high-risk valleys but not in the less-exposed hilltops. Investment in targeted and regular control measures associated with effective case management should be able to control malaria in the highlands.

TI Transmission of Bartonella henselae by Ixodes ricinus
AB Bartonella spp. are facultative intracellular bacteria associated with several emerging diseases in humans and animals. B. henselae causes cat-scratch disease and is increasingly associated with several other syndromes, particularly ocular infections and endocarditis. Cats are the main reservoir for B. henselae and the bacteria are transmitted to cats by cat fleas. However, new potential vectors are suspected of transmitting B. henselae, in particular, Ixodes ricinus, the most abundant ixodid tick that bites humans in western Europe. We used a membrane-feeding technique to infect I. ricinus with B. henselae and demonstrate transmission of B. henselae within I. ricinus across developmental stages, migration or multiplication of B. henselae in salivary glands after a second meal, and transmission of viable and infective B. henselae from ticks to blood. These results provide evidence that I. ricinus is a competent vector for B. henselae.

TI The effects of multiple infections on the expression and evolution of
   virulence in a Daphnia-endoparasite system
AB Multiple infections of a host by different strains of the same microparasite are common in nature. Although numerous models have been developed in an attempt to predict the evolutionary effects of intrahost competition, tests of the assumptions of these models are rare and the outcome is diverse. In the present study we examined the outcome of mixed-isolate infections in individual hosts, using a single clone of the waterflea Daphnia magna and three isolates of its semelparous endoparasite Pasteuria ramosa. We exposed individual Daphnia to single- and mixed-isolate infection treatments, both simultaneously and sequentially. Virulence was assessed by monitoring host mortality and fecundity, and parasite spore production was used as a measure of parasite fitness. Consistent with most assumptions, in multiply infected hosts we found that the virulence of mixed infections resembled that of the more virulent competitor, both in simultaneous multiple infections and in sequential multiple infections in which the virulent isolate was first to infect. The more virulent competitor also produced the vast majority of transmission stages. Only when the less virulent isolate was first to infect, the intrahost contest resembled scramble competition, whereby both isolates suffered by producing fewer transmission stages. Surprisingly, mixed-isolate infections resulted in lower fecundity-costs for the hosts, suggesting that parasite competition comes with an advantage for the host relative to single infections. Finally, spore production correlated positively with time-to-host-death. Thus, early-killing of more competitive isolates produces less transmission stages than less virulent, inferior isolates. Our results are consistent with the idea that less virulent parasite lines may be replaced by more virulent strains under conditions with high rates of multiple infections.

TI Host ecology shapes geographical variation for resistance to bacterial
   infection in Drosophila melanogaster
AB 1. Geographically distinct host populations often experience very different ecological conditions. These variable ecological conditions impact the strength of selection that these hosts experience from their parasites.
   2. Numerous studies have characterized geographical patterns of resistance to infection among natural populations in the context of host-parasite local adaptation, but what other factors might contribute to these differences?
   3. Here, we determined whether 20 naturally isolated populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected along the East Coast of the United States varied for survival after being inoculated with one of two species of bacteria - Lactococcus lactis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We then asked whether host environment accounted for the observed patterns of resistance.
   4. Resistance to both types of infection varied spatially. The hosts' natural environment was predictive of the observed spatial variation in resistance to L. lactis, but not P. aeruginosa, infection. Specifically, hosts exposed to species-rich bacterial communities were more likely to survive the infection.
   5. We conclude that biotic characteristics of the host environment, specifically the number of species of bacteria hosts encounter, shape host resistance to bacterial infection in nature. We discuss our results in the context of what is known about the evolutionary ecology of resistance in invertebrate systems.

TI The contribution of parasitism to selection on floral traits in Heuchera
   grossulariifolia
AB Parasites are ubiquitous and have well-documented ecological consequences. In contrast, the extent to which parasites drive phenotypic evolution in hosts remains obscure. We use a recently developed statistical technique - selective source analysis - to analyse the strength of phenotypic selection acting on floral traits in the plant Heuchera grossulariifolia attributable to attack by the seed-parasitic moth, Greya politella. This analysis spanned 3 years and included two sympatric populations of the host plant H. grossulariifolia that differ in ploidy. Our analyses revealed that attack by G. politella contributed to phenotypic selection for flowering time and floral display size, favouring earlier flowering in the polyploid population, later flowering in the diploid population and increased floral display size in the polyploid population. Although selection imposed by parasite attack was generally quite weak, in one of the 3 years parasites generated a modestly strong selection gradient (beta = -0.059) that explained 38.6% of total observed phenotypic selection for earlier flowering in the polyploid population. Together, our results demonstrate parasites can generate significant phenotypic selection, but that such selection may be sporadic across populations and time.

TI Effects of malaria double infection in birds: one plus one is not two
AB Avian malaria parasites are supposed to exert negative effects on host fitness because these intracellular parasites affect host metabolism. Recent advances in molecular genotyping and microscopy have revealed that coinfections with multiple parasites are frequent in bird-malaria parasite systems. However, studies of the fitness consequences of such double infections are scarce and inconclusive. We tested if the infection with two malaria parasite lineages has more negative effects than single infection using 6 years of data from a natural population of house martins. Survival was negatively affected by both types of infections. We found an additive cost from single to double infection in body condition, but not in reproductive parameters (double-infected had higher reproductive success). These results demonstrate that malaria infections decrease survival, but also have different consequences on the breeding performance of single- and double-infected wild birds.

Here we study the effects of selection by the microsporidian parasite Octosporea bayeri on populations of Daphnia magna. In a field study, we infected replicated populations of D. magna with the parasite, leaving control populations uninfected. After two summer seasons of experimental evolution (about 15 generations), the genetic composition of infected host populations differed significantly from the control populations. Experiments revealed that hosts from the populations that had evolved with the parasite had lower mortality on exposure to parasite spores and a higher competitive ability than hosts that had evolved without the parasite. In contrast, the susceptibility of the two treatment groups to another parasite, the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa, which was not present during experimental evolution of the populations, did not differ. Fitness assays in the absence of parasites revealed a higher fitness for the control populations, but only under low population density with high resource availability. Overall, our results show that, under natural conditions, Daphnia populations are able to adapt rapidly to the prevailing conditions and that this evolutionary change is specific to the environment.

TI Geographically variable selection in Ambystoma tigrinum virus
   (Iridoviridae) throughout the western USA
AB We investigated spatially variable selection in Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV) which causes frequent and geographically widespread epizootics of the tiger salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum. To test for evidence of selection, we sequenced several coding and noncoding regions from virus strains isolated from epizootics throughout western North America. Three of the sequenced regions contained homologues for genes putatively involved in host immune evasion and virulence: eIF-2 alpha, caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) and beta-OH-steroid oxidoreductase. Selection analysis showed evidence of very strong purifying selection on eIF-2 alpha, purifying selection within certain viral clades on CARD and positive selection on beta-OH-steroid oxidoreductase within certain clades. Analysis using MULTIDIVTIME and Tajima's relative rate tests indicate accelerated rates of evolution within clades associated with anthropogenic movement. These clades also demonstrate greater spatial variability in selection, suggesting a lack of local adaptation (i.e. locally adapted populations should exhibit little to no selection because of absent or reduced variation in fitness once a fitness optimum is reached). Increased transfer of non-native viral strains to naive salamander populations, in conjunction with local maladaptation as a result of local selection pressures, may explain the spread and emergence of ATV epizootics in A. tigrinum in western North America.

TI Protective role of DC-SIGN (CD209) neck-region alleles with < 5 repeat
   units in HIV-1 transmission
AB To investigate the role that DC-SIGN neck-region length variation plays in HIV-1 transmission, we studied 530 HIV-1-positive and 341 HIV-1-negative individuals in China. The carrier frequency of a DC-SIGN allele with <5 repeat units in the neck-region was 0.9% in HIV-1-positive and 3.8% in HIV-1-negative individuals (P = .007), an observation suggesting that this DC-SIGN variation plays a role in HIV-1 transmission. These naturally occurring DC-SIGN neck-region variants were significantly more frequent in the Chinese population than in the US population (P < .001) and in a worldwide population (P = .006).

TI Population structure and diversity in sexual and asexual populations of
   the pathogenic fungus Melampsora lini
AB Many pathogens undergo both sexual and asexual reproduction to varying degrees, yet the ecological, genetic and evolutionary consequences of different reproductive strategies remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the population genetic structure of wild populations of the plant pathogen Melampsora lini on its host Linum marginale, using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, two genes underlying pathogen virulence, and phenotypic variation in virulence. In Australia, M. lini occurs as two genetically and geographically divergent lineages (AA and AB), one of which is completely asexual (AB), and the other able to reproduce both clonally and sexually (AA). To quantify the genetic and evolutionary consequences of these different life histories, we sampled five populations in each of two biogeographical regions. Analysis of AFLP data obtained for 275 isolates revealed largely disjunct geographical distributions for the two different lineages, low genetic diversity within lineages, and strong genetic structure among populations within each region. We also detected significant divergence among populations for both Avr genes and virulence phenotypes, although generally these values were lower than those obtained with AFLP markers. Furthermore, isolates belonging to lineage AA collectively harboured significantly higher genotypic and phenotypic diversity than lineage AB isolates. Together these results illustrate the important roles of reproductive modes and geographical structure in the generation and maintenance of virulence diversity in populations of M. lini.

TI Landscape Diversity Related to Buruli Ulcer Disease in Cote d'Ivoire
AB Background: Buruli ulcer disease (BU), due to the bacteria Mycobacterium ulcerans, represents an important and emerging public health problem, especially in many African countries. Few elements are known nowadays about the routes of transmission of this environmental bacterium to the human population.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we have investigated the relationships between the incidence of BU in Cote d'Ivoire, western Africa, and a group of environmental variables. These environmental variables concern vegetation, crops (rice and banana), dams, and lakes. Using a geographical information system and multivariate analyses, we show a link between cases of BU and different environmental factors for the first time on a country-wide scale. As a result, irrigated rice field cultures areas, and, to a lesser extent, banana fields as well as areas in the vicinity of dams used for irrigation and aquaculture purposes, represent high-risk zones for the human population to contract BU in Cote d'Ivoire. This is much more relevant in the central part of the country.
   Conclusions/Significance: As already suspected by several case-control studies in different African countries, we strengthen in this work the identification of high-risk areas of BU on a national spatial scale. This first study should now be followed by many others in other countries and at a multi-year temporal scale. This goal implies a strong improvement in data collection and sharing in order to achieve to a global picture of the environmental conditions that drive BU emergence and persistence in human populations.

TI Acute Schistosoma mansoni Infection Increases Susceptibility to Systemic
   SHIV Clade C Infection in Rhesus Macaques after Mucosal Virus Exposure
AB Background: Individuals living in sub-Saharan Africa represent 10% of the world's population but almost 2/3 of all HIV-1/AIDS cases. The disproportionate HIV-1 infection rates in this region may be linked to helminthic parasite infections that affect many individuals in the developing world. However, the hypothesis that parasite infection increases an individual's susceptibility to HIV-1 has never been prospectively tested in a relevant in vivo model.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured whether pre-existing infection of rhesus monkeys with a parasitic worm would facilitate systemic infection after mucosal AIDS virus exposure. Two groups of animals, one consisting of normal monkeys and the other harboring Schistosoma mansoni, were challenged intrarectally with decreasing doses of R5-tropic clade C simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C). Systemic infection occurred in parasitized monkeys at viral doses that remained sub-infectious in normal hosts. In fact, the 50% animal infectious (AID(50)) SHIV-C dose was 17-fold lower in parasitized animals compared to controls (P < 0.001). Coinfected animals also had significantly higher peak viral RNA loads than controls (P < 0.001), as well as increased viral replication in CD4(+) central memory cells (P=0.03).
   Conclusions/Significance: Our data provide the first direct evidence that acute schistosomiasis significantly increases the risk of de novo AIDS virus acquisition, and the magnitude of the effect suggests that control of helminth infections may be a useful public health intervention to help decrease the spread of HIV-1.

TI Differentiation and Gene Flow among European Populations of Leishmania
   infantum MON-1
AB Background: Leishmania infantum is the causative agent of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean region, South America, and China. MON-1 L. infantum is the predominating zymodeme in all endemic regions, both in humans and dogs, the reservoir host. In order to answer important epidemiological questions it is essential to discriminate strains of MON-1.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We have used a set of 14 microsatellite markers to analyse 141 strains of L. infantum mainly from Spain, Portugal, and Greece of which 107 strains were typed by MLEE as MON-1. The highly variable microsatellites have the potential to discriminate MON-1 strains from other L. infantum zymodemes and even within MON-1 strains. Model- and distance-based analysis detected a considerable amount of structure within European L. infantum. Two major monophyletic groups-MON-1 and non-MON-1-could be distinguished, with non-MON-1 being more polymorphic. Strains of MON-98, 77, and 108 were always part of the MON-1 group. Among MON-1, three geographically determined and genetically differentiated populations could be identified: ( 1) Greece; ( 2) Spain islands-Majorca/Ibiza; ( 3) mainland Portugal/Spain. All four populations showed a predominantly clonal structure; however, there are indications of occasional recombination events and gene flow even between MON-1 and non-MON-1. Sand fly vectors seem to play an important role in sustaining genetic diversity. No correlation was observed between Leishmania genotypes, host specificity, and clinical manifestation. In the case of relapse/re-infection, only re-infections by a strain with a different MLMT profile can be unequivocally identified, since not all strains have individual MLMT profiles.
   Conclusion: In the present study for the first time several key epidemiological questions could be addressed for the MON-1 zymodeme, because of the high discriminatory power of microsatellite markers, thus creating a basis for further epidemiological investigations.

TI Relationship between Transmission Intensity and Incidence of Dengue
   Hemorrhagic Fever in Thailand
AB Background: Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus, and potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) occurs mainly in secondary infections. It recently was hypothesized that, due to the presence of cross-immunity, the relationship between the incidence of DHF and transmission intensity may be negative at areas of intense transmission. We tested this hypothesis empirically, using vector abundance as a surrogate of transmission intensity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: House Index (HI), which is defined as the percentage of households infested with vector larvae/pupae, was obtained from surveys conducted on one million houses in Thailand, between 2002 and 2004. First, the utility of HI as a surrogate of transmission intensity was confirmed because HI was correlated negatively with mean age of DHF in the population. Next, the relationship between DHF incidence and HI was investigated. DHF incidence increased only up to an HI of about 30, but declined thereafter. Reduction of HI from the currently maximal level to 30 would increase the incidence by more than 40%. Simulations, which implemented a recently proposed model for cross-immunity, generated results that resembled actual epidemiological data. It was predicted that cross-immunity generates a wide variation in incidence, thereby obscuring the relationship between incidence and transmission intensity. The relationship would become obvious only if data collected over a long duration (e. g., > 10 years) was averaged.
   Conclusion: The negative relationship between DHF incidence and dengue transmission intensity implies that in regions of intense transmission, insufficient reduction of vector abundance may increase long-term DHF incidence. Further studies of a duration much longer than the present study, are warranted.

TI Age-related and infection intensity-related shifts in antibody
   recognition of defined protein antigens in a schistosome-exposed
   population
AB Background. This study compared patterns of recognition of defined Schistosoma haematobium adult worm antigens by serum antibodies from schistosome-exposed Zimbabweans aged 5-18 years.
   Methods. The population was stratified by age and infection intensity into 9 groups within which serum specimens were pooled and used to screen for protein recognition by 2-dimensional Western blotting. Recognized proteins were identified by electrospray ionizing tandem mass spectrometry.
   Results. A total of 71 antigens were recognized by >= 1 of the serum pools. The recognition varied distinctly with host age and infection intensity, with some isoform-specific responses. The repertoire of antigens recognized increased with age, peaking in the oldest participants whose had no or mild-to-moderate infection intensity. The intensity of antigen recognition also increased with age, peaking in the oldest participants with the heaviest infection intensity.
   Conclusions. The recognition of specific schistosome antigens, both in terms of the diversity of antigens recognized and the intensity of antigen recognition, increased with duration of exposure to infection, supporting the hypothesis that the slow development of schistosome-acquired immunity is due to the slow accumulation of responsiveness to relevant parasite antigens.

TI Host manipulation by parasites in the world of dead-end predators:
   adaptation to enhance transmission?
AB Trophically transmitted parasites often alter their intermediate host's phenotype, thereby predisposing the hosts to increased predation. This is generally considered a parasite strategy evolved to enhance transmission to the next hosts. However, the adaptive value of host manipulation is not clear as it may be associated with costs, such as increased susceptibility to predators that are unsuitable next hosts for the parasites. We examined the ratio between the benefits and costs of host manipulation for transmission success of Acanthocephalus lucii (Acanthocephala), a parasite that alters the hiding behaviour and pigmentation of its isopod hosts. We experimentally compared the susceptibility of infected and uninfected isopods to predation by perch (Perca fluvialis; definitive host of the parasite) and dragonfly larvae (dead end). We found that the parasite predisposed the isopods to predation by both predators. However, the increased predation vulnerability of the infected isopods was higher towards perch. This suggests that, despite the costs due to non-host predation, host manipulation may still be advantageous for the parasite.

TI Availability of prey resources drives evolution of predator-prey
   interaction
AB Productivity is predicted to drive the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of predator-prey interaction through changes in resource allocation between different traits. Here we report results of an evolutionary experiment where prey bacteria Serratia marcescens was exposed to predatory protozoa Tetrahymena thermophila in low- and high-resource environments for approximately 2400 prey generations. Predation generally increased prey allocation to defence and caused prey selection lines to become more diverse. On average, prey became most defensive in the high-resource environment and suffered from reduced resource use ability more in the low-resource environment. As a result, the evolution of stronger prey defence in the high-resource environment led to a strong decrease in predator-to-prey ratio. Predation increased temporal variability of populations and traits of prey. However, this destabilizing effect was less pronounced in the high-resource environment. Our results demonstrate that prey resource availability can shape the trade-off allocation of prey traits, which in turn affects multiple properties of the evolving predator-prey system.

TI Phylogeny and geography predict pathogen community similarity in wild
   primates and humans
AB In natural systems, host species are often co-infected by multiple pathogen species, and recent work has suggested that many pathogens can infect a wide range of host species. An important question therefore is what determines the host range of a pathogen and the community of pathogens found within a given host species. Using primates as a model, we show that infectious diseases are more often shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographical region. We find that host relatedness is the best overall predictor of whether two host species share the same pathogens. A higher frequency of pathogen host shifts between close relatives or inheritance of pathogens from a common ancestor may explain this result. For viruses, geographical overlap among neighbouring primate hosts is more important in determining host range. We suggest this is because rapid evolution within viral lineages allows host jumps across larger evolutionary distances. We also show that the phylogenetic pattern of pathogen sharing with humans is the same as that between wild primates. For humans, this means we share a higher proportion of pathogens with the great apes, including chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species are our closest relatives.

TI Aedes aegypti in Senegal: Genetic diversity and genetic structure of
   domestic and sylvatic populations
AB Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue viruses. The epidemiology of dengue fever remains poorly understood in Senegal. A sylvatic transmission seems to predominate. However, despite the sylvatic circulation of the dengue virus and the presence of vectors in urban areas, only sporadic cases have been reported. Ae. aegypti is a polytypic species. In Senegal, a purely sylvatic form is found in the forest gallery areas and a domestic form is found in the villages in savannah and sahelian areas and in urban areas. Using allozymes, we analyzed the genetic diversity and the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations differing in their ecological characteristics. Populations from Senegal were significantly structured but with a low level of genetic differentiation. Ae. aegypti from the "domestic" populations show a decreased genetic diversity and a lower genetic differentiation compared with "sylvatic" populations. These findings suggest that environmental conditions, ecological factors, and human activities may impact the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations in Senegal.

TI Spatial and temporal heterogeneity explain disease dynamics in a
   spatially explicit network model
AB There is an increasing recognition that individual-level spatial and temporal heterogeneity may play an important role in metapopulation dynamics and persistence. In particular, the patterns of contact within and between aggregates (e. g., demes) at different spatial and temporal scales may reveal important mechanisms governing metapopulation dynamics. Using 7 years of data on the interaction between the anther smut fungus (Microbotryum violaceum) and fire pink (Silene virginica), we show how the application of spatially explicit and implicit network models can be used to make accurate predictions of infection dynamics in spatially structured populations. Explicit consideration of both spatial and temporal organization reveals the role of each in spreading risk for both the host and the pathogen. This work suggests that the application of spatially explicit network models can yield important insights into how heterogeneous structure can promote the persistence of species in natural landscapes.

TI Interactions between macroparasites and microparasites drive infection
   patterns in free-ranging African buffalo
AB Epidemiological studies typically focus on single-parasite systems, although most hosts harbor multiple parasite species; thus, the potential impacts of co-infection on disease dynamics are only beginning to be recognized. Interactions between macroparasites, such as gastrointestinal nematodes, and microparasites causing diseases like TB, AIDS, and malaria are particularly interesting because co-infection may favor transmission and progression of these important diseases. Here we present evidence for strong interactions between gastrointestinal worms and bovine tuberculosis (TB) in free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). TB and worms are negatively associated at the population, among-herd, and within-herd scales, and this association is not solely the result of demographic heterogeneities in infection. Combining data from 1362 buffalo with simple mechanistic models, we find that both accelerated mortality of co-infected individuals and TB transmission heterogeneity caused by trade-offs in immunity to the two types of parasites likely contribute to observed infection patterns. This study is one of the first to examine the relevance of within-host immunological trade-offs for understanding parasite distribution patterns in natural populations.

TI Multiple causes of variable tick burdens on small-mammal hosts
AB Blood meals by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) on vertebrate hosts serve to transmit the agents of several zoonotic diseases, including Lyme disease, human babesiosis, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis, between host and tick. If ticks are aggregated on hosts, a small proportion of hosts may be responsible for most transmission events. Therefore, a key element in understanding and controlling the transmission of these pathogens is identifying the group(s) or individuals feeding a disproportionate number of ticks. Previous studies of tick burdens, however, have focused on differences in mean annual burdens between one or a few groups of hosts, ignoring both the strong seasonal dynamics of I. scapularis and their aggregation on hosts. We present a statistical modeling framework that predicts burdens on individual hosts throughout the year as a function of temporal-, site-, and individual-specific attributes, as well as the degree of aggregation in a negative binomial distribution. We then fit alternate versions of this model to an 11-year data set of I. scapularis burdens on white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) to explore which factors are important to predicting tick burdens.

TI Diverse contexts of zoonotic transmission of simian foamy viruses in
   Asia
AB In Asia, contact between persons and nonhuman primates is widespread in multiple occupational and nonoccupational contexts. Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are retroviruses that are prevalent in all species of nonhuman primates. To determine SFV prevalence in humans, we tested 305 persons who lived or worked around nonhuman primates in several South and Southeast Asian countries; 8 (2.6%) were confirmed SFV positive by Western blot and, for some, by PCR. The interspecies interactions that likely resulted in virus transmission were diverse; 5 macaque taxa were implicated as the source of infection. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SFV from 3 infected persons was similar to that from the nonhuman primate populations with which the infected persons reported contact. Thus, SFV infections are likely to be prevalent among persons who live or work near nonhuman primates in Asia.

A web-based reporting system enhanced the flow of information between public health authorities, providing real-time epidemic curves and frequency distributions. The same 1B HAV genotype wits found in 90 % of sera from a subset of patients with acute disease, suggesting a local common source. A case-control study in the municipality with the highest attack rate showed that raw seafood consumption, in particular if illegally sold in water, was strongly associated with HAV illness. Samples of seafood systematically collected from retailers were found contaminated by HAV.

   among schoolchildren
AB We coupled the Wells-Riley equation and the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery (SEIR) model to quantify the impact of the combination of indoor air-based control measures of enhanced ventilation and respiratory masking in containing pandemic influenza within an elementary school. We integrated indoor environmental factors of a real elementary school and aetiological characteristics of influenza to estimate the age-specific risk of infection (P) and basic reproduction number (R-0). We combined the enhanced ventilation rates of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2/h and respiratory masking with 60 %, 70 %, 80 %, and 95% efficacies, respectively, to predict the reducing level of R-0 We also took into account the critical vaccination coverage rate among schoolchildren. Age-specific P and R-0 were estimated respectively to be 0.29 and 16.90; 0.56 and 16.11; 0.59 and 12.88; 0.64 and 16.09; and 0.07 and 2.80 for five age groups 4-6,7-8, 9-10, 11-12, and 25-45 years, indicating pre-schoolchildren have the highest transmission potential. We conclude that Our integrated approach, employing the mechanism of transmission of indoor respiratory infection, population-dynamic transmission model, and the impact of infectious control programmes, is a powerful tool for risk profiling prediction of pandemic influenza among schoolchildren.

TI An assessment of Culicoides surveillance techniques in northern Europe:
   have we underestimated a potential bluetongue virus vector?
AB 1. Bluetongue virus (BTV), a pathogen of ruminants transmitted by Culicoides midges, has emerged dramatically across Europe since 1998. Surveillance of Culicoides is currently carried out in every European country affected by BTV, most commonly using standardized light-suction traps that sample the population of adult Culicoides present. To date, however, it is not clear whether these trap catches accurately reflect the biting population of Culicoides.
   2. In our study, we carried out 192 drop-trap catches at dusk on Poll Dorset sheep, drawing comparisons with surveillance samples taken using standard trapping protocol at the same site. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction technique was optimized for high-throughput processing of cryptic species to allow Culicoides collected to be identified to species level, the first time this has been achieved in this region for an ecological study. A mathematical model was then constructed to describe rates of midge biting under the meteorological conditions recorded during trials.
   3. Light-trapping surveillance was found to substantially underestimate the numbers of Culicoides chiopterus present on sheep. This finding is extremely significant given that, due to the low numbers of this species caught at light traps across northern Europe, C. chiopterus had not been seriously considered as a potential vector of BTV.
   4. The models constructed of successful blood feeding predict that while biting rates on sheep are significantly reduced under conditions adverse to midge flight (wind speeds that exceeded 3 mps, wind turbulence of greater than 40 degrees change in direction during the trial and solar intensity exceeding 200 Wm(-2)), low levels of biting can also occur under sub-optimal meteorological conditions, that have the potential to span entire days in the later part of the adult season.
   5. Synthesis and applications. It is clear from these results that light-trapping surveillance does not provide an accurate reflection of the biting population of Culicoides present. Given that the surveillance systems are already in wide employment across Europe, but provide misleading results as we have demonstrated, and considering the huge economic and animal welfare impact of BTV incursions, it is vital that alternative/additional methods of surveillance are explored. Additionally, the vector competence of C. chiopterus as a potential vector of arboviruses requires urgent assessment, along with a clearer understanding of diel periodicity of Culicoides attacks throughout the adult season.

TI Exploring reservoir dynamics: a case study of rabies in the Serengeti
   ecosystem
AB 1. Knowledge of infection reservoir dynamics is critical for effective disease control, but identifying reservoirs of multi-host pathogens is challenging. Here, we synthesize several lines of evidence to investigate rabies reservoirs in complex carnivore communities of the Serengeti ecological region in northwest Tanzania, where the disease has been confirmed in 12 carnivore species.
   2. Long-term monitoring data suggest that rabies persists in high-density domestic dog Canis familiaris populations (> 11 dogs km(-2)) and occurs less frequently in lower-density (< 5 dogs km(-2)) populations and only sporadically in wild carnivores.
   3. Genetic data show that a single rabies virus variant belonging to the group of southern Africa canid-associated viruses (Africa 1b) circulates among a range of species, with no evidence of species-specific virus-host associations.
   4. Within-species transmission was more frequently inferred from high-resolution epidemiological data than between-species transmission. Incidence patterns indicate that spill-over of rabies from domestic dog populations sometimes initiates short-lived chains of transmission in other carnivores.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The balance of evidence suggests that the reservoir of rabies in the Serengeti ecosystem is a complex multi-host community where domestic dogs are the only population essential for persistence, although other carnivores contribute to the reservoir as non-maintenance populations. Control programmes that target domestic dog populations should therefore have the greatest impact on reducing the risk of infection in all other species including humans, livestock and endangered wildlife populations, but transmission in other species may increase the level of vaccination coverage in domestic dog populations necessary to eliminate rabies.

TI Population structure of the parasitic nematode Anguillicola crassus, an
   invader of declining North Atlantic eel stocks
AB Probably half of all animal species exhibit a parasitic lifestyle and numerous parasites have recently expanded their distribution and host ranges due to anthropogenic activities. Here, we report on the population genetic structure of the invasive nematode Anguillicola crassus, a parasite in freshwater eels, which recently spread from Asia to Europe and North America. Samples were collected from the newly colonized naive host species Anguilla anguilla (Europe) and Anguilla rostrata (North America), and from indigenous Anguilla japonica in Taiwan and Japan. Using seven microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial marker, we show that the parasite's population structure in Europe mirrors the zoogeographic Boreal-Lusitanian break along the English Channel. Both the north-to-south decline of nuclear allelic diversity and the loss of private alleles in the same direction are consistent with a significant isolation-by-distance pattern based on rho(ST) values. In combination with the specific topology of the distance tree among nematode populations, our data suggest that Europe was invaded only once from Taiwan, and that subsequently, genetic diversity was lost due to random drift. On the contrary, the North American sample shares distinct nuclear and mitochondrial signatures with Japanese specimens. We propose that the genetic structure in Europe was shaped by long-range anthropogenic eel host transfers in the north and a single dispersal event into the southwest. The genetically distinct Brittany sample at the edge of the Boreal-Lusitanian boundary is indicative of natural dispersal of fish hosts since recruitment occurs naturally there and invertebrate host dissemination is interrupted due to oceanic currents.

TI Solving cryptogenic histories using host and parasite molecular
   genetics: the resolution of Littorina littorea's North American origin
AB Even after decades of investigation using multiple sources of evidence, the natural histories of some species remain unclear (i.e. cryptogenic). A key example is Littorina littorea, the most abundant intertidal snail in northeastern North America. Native to Europe, the snail's ecological history in North America has been debated for over 100 years with no definitive resolution. To resolve its cryptogenic status, we used molecular genetics from a novel combination of the snail and a highly associated trematode parasite, Cryptocotyle lingua. Based on mitochondrial sequences of 370 L. littorea and 196 C. lingua individuals, our results demonstrate a significant reduction in genetic diversity in North America vs. Europe, North American haplotypes nested within European haplotypes, and mean divergence estimates of similar to 500 years ago from Europe for both host and parasite - thus supporting a recent introduction of both host and parasite to North America from Europe. Our study therefore resolves not only a specific cryptogenic history, but it also demonstrates the success of our approach generally and could be used in resolving difficult invasion histories worldwide.

TI Host Control of Malaria Infections: Constraints on Immune and
   Erythropoeitic Response Kinetics
AB The two main agents of human malaria, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, can induce severe anemia and provoke strong, complex immune reactions. Which dynamical behaviors of host immune and erythropoietic responses would foster control of infection, and which would lead to runaway parasitemia and/or severe anemia? To answer these questions, we developed differential equation models of interacting parasite and red blood cell (RBC) populations modulated by host immune and erythropoietic responses. The model immune responses incorporate both a rapidly responding innate component and a slower-responding, long-term antibody component, with several parasite developmental stages considered as targets for each type of immune response. We found that simulated infections with the highest parasitemia tended to be those with ineffective innate immunity even if antibodies were present. We also compared infections with dyserythropoiesis (reduced RBC production during infection) to those with compensatory erythropoiesis (boosted RBC production) or a fixed basal RBC production rate. Dyserythropoiesis tended to reduce parasitemia slightly but at a cost to the host of aggravating anemia. On the other hand, compensatory erythropoiesis tended to reduce the severity of anemia but with enhanced parasitemia if the innate response was ineffective. For both parasite species, sharp transitions between the schizont and the merozoite stages of development (i.e., with standard deviation in intra-RBC development time <= 2.4 h) were associated with lower parasitemia and less severe anemia. Thus tight synchronization in asexual parasite development might help control parasitemia. Finally, our simulations suggest that P. vivax can induce severe anemia as readily as P. falciparum for the same type of immune response, though P. vivax attacks a much smaller subset of RBCs. Since most P. vivax infections are nonlethal (if debilitating) clinically, this suggests that P. falciparum adaptations for countering or evading immune responses are more effective than those of P. vivax.

AB Toxocara canis (Ascaridida: Nematoda), which parasitizes (at the adult stage) the small intestine of canids, can be transmitted to a range of other mammals, including humans, and can cause the disease toxocariasis. Despite its significance as a pathogen, the genetics, epidemiology and biology of this parasite remain poorly understood. In addition, the zoonotic potential of related species of Toxocara, such as T. cati and T. malaysiensis, is not well known. Mitochondrial DNA is known to provide genetic markers for investigations in these areas, but complete mitochondrial genomic data have been lacking for T. canis and its congeners. In the present study, the mitochondrial genome of T. canis was amplified by long-range polymerase chain reaction (long PCR) and sequenced using a primer-walking strategy. This circular mitochondrial genome was 14162 bp and contained 12 protein-coding, 22 transfer RNA, and 2 ribosomal RNA genes consistent for secernentean nematodes, including Ascaris suum and Anisakis simplex (Ascaridida). The mitochondrial genome of T. canis provides genetic markers for studies into the systematics, population genetics and epidemiology of this zoonotic parasite and its congeners. Such markers can now be used in prospecting for cryptic species and for exploring host specificity and zoonotic potential, thus underpinning the prevention and control of toxocariasis in humans and other hosts.

TI Serological and molecular prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum, and Ehrlichia species in dogs from Minnesota
AB A population of 731 naturally exposed pet dogs examined at a private practice in Baxter, Minnesota, an area endemic for Lyme disease and anaplasmosis, was tested by serological and molecular methods for evidence of exposure to or infection with selected vector-borne pathogens. Serum samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Aanaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Ehrlichia canis antibodies and for Dirofilaria immitis antigen. Blood samples from 273 dogs were also analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species DNA. Based on the owner history and the attending veterinarian's physical examination findings, dogs exhibiting illness compatible with anaplasmosis or borreliosis were considered clinical cases, and their results were compared to the healthy dog population. Antibodies to only A. phagocytophilum were detected in 217 (29%) dogs; to only B. burgdorferi, in 80 (11%) dogs; and seroreactivity to both organisms, in 188 (25%) dogs. Of 89 suspected cases of canine anaplasmosis or borreliosis, A. phagocytophilum or B. burgdorferi antibodies were detected in 22 dogs (25%) and 8 dogs (9%) respectively, whereas antibodies to both organisms were found in 38 dogs (43%). Ehrlichia canis antibodies and D. immitis antigen were each detected in 11 (1.5%) dogs. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was amplified from 7 of 222 (3%) healthy dogs and 19 of 51 (37%) clinical cases. Seroreactivity to both A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi was detected more frequently in suspected cases of anaplasmosis and/or borreliosis than seroreactivity to either organism alone. Based on PCR testing, A. phagocytophilum DNA was more prevalent in suspected cases of anaplasmosis or borreliosis than in healthy dogs from the same region.

TI Intensive early season adulticide applications decrease arbovirus
   transmission throughout the Coachella Valley, Riverside County,
   California
AB in the Coachella Valley of California the seasonal onset of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV), and West Nile virus (WNV) has been detected consistently at the shoreline of the Salton Sea near the community of North Shore. The timing and intensity of initial amplification in the Culex tarsalis Coquillett/wild bird cycle at this focus seemed closely linked to the subsequent dispersal of virus to the rest of the Coachella Valley and perhaps southern California. In 2004, an attempt was made to interrupt the amplification and dispersal of WNV using ground ultra-low volume (ULV) applications of Pyrenone 25-5 (R). Although these localized treatments were started 1. month after the initial detection in April, surveillance indicated no dispersal from this focus at this time. However, these treatments appeared to have little effect, and WNV eventually was detected throughout the valley, with seven human cases reported in the urbanized upper valley near Palm Springs. In 2005, the initial detection of WNV at North Shore at the end of May was followed rapidly by dispersal throughout the valley precluding efforts at containment. Evaluation of ground and aerial applications at North Shore during May and June 2005, respectively, indicated variable kill of sentinel mosquitoes (overall mortality: ground, 43%; air, 34%) and limited control of the target Cx.. tarsalis population. In 2006, aerial ULV applications with the same chemical were begun immediately following the first detection of virus in mid-April, resulting in an apparent reduction of Cx. tarsalis abundance and delay of WNV activity in the rural lower valley and a marked decline in transmission by Cidex quinquefasciatus Say populations in the densely populated upper northwestern valley with no human cases reported.

TI Experimental and field studies on the suitability of raccoons (Procyon
   lotor) as hosts for tick-borne pathogens
AB We investigated the experimental susceptibility and natural exposure of raccoons (Procyon lotor) to five tick-borne pathogens of human and veterinary importance, Ehrlichia canis, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (ApVariant 1 and Ap-ha HGE-1 strains), and Borrelia lonestari. Infections were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indirect fluorescent antibody OFA) testing, and/or culture isolation methods for at least 30 days postinoculation (DPI). Two E. chaffeensis-inoculated raccoons seroconverted and were transiently PCR positive. One raccoon was culture positive. Laboratory raised Amblyomma americanum nymphs fed on a third infected raccoon failed to become infected. Two A. phagocytophilum (HGE-1)-inoculated raccoons became PCR positive and seroconverted. Both remained positive for at least 74 DPI. In contrast, raccoons inoculated with A. phagocytophilum (Ap-Variant 1) were only transiently PCR positive and only seroconverted with low titers. No evidence of infection was observed for E. ewingii- and B. lonestari-inoculated raccoons. Only one E. canis-inoculated raccoon was PCR positive 3 DPI. Serologic testing of wild raccoons from five populations (3 infested with ticks) in Georgia and Florida showed antibodies reactive with E. chaffeensis in the 3 tick-infested populations (range of 30%-46%), E. canis in the same three populations (8%-23%), A. phagocytophilum in a single raccoon from Florida (12%), and Borrelia spp. in all 5 populations (8%-53%). All raccoons were PCR negative for tick-borne pathogens. These data suggest that raccoons are likely not important reservoirs of E. canis, E. ewingii, or B. lonestari. However, raccoons are experimentally susceptible and naturally exposed to E. chaffeensis, and these data support the previous finding that raccoons may be involved in the natural history of A. phagocytophilum.

TI Meteorologically conditioned time-series predictions of West Nile virus
   vector mosquitoes
AB An empirical model to forecast West Nile virus mosquito vector populations is developed using time series analysis techniques. Specifically, multivariate seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models were developed for Aedes vexans and the combined group of Culex pipiens and Culex restuans in Erie County, New York. Weekly mosquito collections data were obtained for the four mosquito seasons from 2002 to 2005 from the Erie County Department of Health, Vector and Pest Control Program. Climate variables were tested for significance with cross-correlation analysis. Minimum temperature (T-min), maximum temperature (T-max), average temperature (T-ave), precipitation (P), relative humidity (R-H), and evapotranspiration (ET) were acquired from the Northeast Regional Climate Center (NRCC) at Cornell University. Weekly averages or sums of climate variables were calculated from the daily data. Other climate indexes were calculated and were tested for significance with the mosquito population data, including cooling degree days base 60 degrees (CDD-60), cooling degree days base 63 (CDD-63), cooling degree days base 65 (CDD-65), a ponding index (I-p), and an interactive CDD-65-precipitation variable (CDD-65 X P-week_4). Ae. vexans were adequately modeled with a (2,1,1)(1,1,0)(52) SARIMA model. The combined group of Cidex pipiens-restuans were modeled with a (0,1,10,1052 SARIMA model. The most significant meteorological variables for forecasting Aedes vexans abundance was the interactive CDD-65 X Pweek-4 variable at a lag of two weeks, E-T X E-T at a lag of five weeks, and CDD-65 X CDD-65 at a lag of seven weeks. The most significant predictive variables for the grouped Culex pipiens-restuans were CDD-63 X CDD-63 at a lag of zero weeks, CDD-63 at a lag of eight weeks, and the cumulative maximum ponding index (I-Pcum) at a lag of zero weeks.

TI Poor condition and infection: a vicious circle in natural populations
AB Pathogens may be important for host population dynamics, as they can be a proximate cause of morbidity and mortality. Infection dynamics, in turn, may be dependent on the underlying condition of hosts. There is a clear potential for synergy between infection and condition: poor condition predisposes to host infections, which further reduce condition and so on. To provide empirical data that support this notion, we measured haematological indicators of infection (neutrophils and monocytes) and condition (red blood cells (RBCs) and lymphocytes) in field voles from three populations sampled monthly for 2 years. Mixed-effect models were developed to evaluate two hypotheses, (i) that individuals with low lymphocyte and/or RBC levels are more prone to show elevated haematological indicators of infection when re-sampled four weeks later, and (ii) that a decline in indicators of condition is likely to follow the development of monocytosis or neutrophilia. We found that individuals with low RBC and lymphocyte counts had increased probabilities of developing monocytosis and higher increments in neutrophils, and that high indices of infection (neutrophilia and monocytosis) were generally followed by a declining tendency in the indicators of condition (RBCs and lymphocytes). The vicious circle that these results describe suggests that while pathogens overall may be more important in wildlife dynamics than has previously been appreciated, specific pathogens are likely to play their part as elements of an interactive web rather than independent entities.

   epidemic, Kaohsiung, Taiwan
AB This study analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of 4,587 (94% of the total) confirmed dengue cases in Kaohsiung and Fengshan Cities (a two-city area) that occurred in Taiwan from 2001 to 2003. The epidemic had two simultaneous distinct diffusion patterns. One was a contiguous pattern, mostly limited to I km from an initial cluster, reflecting that there was a rapid dispersal of infected Aedes aegypti and viremic persons. The second followed a relocation pattern, involving clusters of cases that diffused over 10 weeks starting from the southern and moving to the northern parts of the two-city area. The virus from one clustering site jumped to several distant areas where it rapidly dispersed through a series of human-mosquito transmission cycles to several localities. In both patterns, transmission of disease quickly enlarged the epidemic areas. Future dengue control efforts would benefit from a timely syndromic surveillance system plus extensive public education on how to avoid further transmission.

TI Transmission-recovery trade-offs to study parasite evolution
AB Parasite evolution is mainly studied through a trade-off involving host death (i.e., virulence) and transmission. In addition to the lack of evidence, this trade-off largely fails to understand the evolution of sublethal parasite effects. Here, I argue that considering host recovery as a main selection pressure faced by the parasite helps to address these problems and opens new perspectives for the study of parasite evolution. Using an embedded model, I show how a trade-off between transmission and recovery may emerge from within-host dynamics if immune activation is assumed to depend on the parasite's overall growth rate. I also show that the value of the parasite's optimal growth rate strongly depends on the immunological state of the host. Transmission-recovery trade-offs are of particular interest to the study of the evolution of human pathogens because of the use of antipathogen treatments, which strengthens the recovery constraint.

TI Naturally Induced Humoral Immunity to West Nile Virus Infection in
   Raptors
AB West Nile virus (WNV) infection can be fatal to many bird species, including numerous raptors, though population- and ecosystem-level impacts following introduction of the virus to North America have been difficult to document. Raptors occupy a diverse array of habitats worldwide and are important to ecosystems for their role as opportunistic predators. We documented initial (primary) WNV infection and then regularly measured WNV-specific neutralizing antibody titers in 16 resident raptors of seven species, plus one turkey vulture. Most individuals were initially infected and seroconverted between July and September of 2003, though three birds remained seronegative until summer 2006. Many of these birds became clinically ill upon primary infection, with clinical signs ranging from loss of appetite to moderate neurological disease. Naturally induced WNV neutralizing antibody titers remained essentially unchanged in some birds, while eight individuals experienced secondary rises in titer presumably due to additional exposures at 1, 2, or 3 years following primary infection. No birds experienced clinical signs surrounding or following the time of secondary exposure, and therefore antibodies were considered protective. Results of this study have implications for transmission dynamics of WNV and health of raptor populations, as well as the interpretation of serologic data from free-ranging and captive birds. Antibodies in raptors surviving WNV may persist for multiple years and protect against potential adverse effects of subsequent exposures.

TI Poxviral Disease in Red Squirrels Sciurus vulgaris in the UK: Spatial
   and Temporal Trends of an Emerging Threat
AB The squirrel poxvirus (SQPV) is the probable mediator of apparent competition between the introduced invading gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) in the UK, and modeling studies have shown that this viral disease has had a significant impact on the decline of the red squirrel in the UK. However, given our limited understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, and more generally the effects of invasive species on parasite ecology, there is a need to investigate the transmission dynamics and the relative pathogenicity of the virus between species. We aimed to increase our knowledge of these processes through an empirical study in which we: (i) used pathological signs and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to diagnose SQPV disease in red squirrels found dead during scanning surveillance between 1993 and 2005; (ii) detected antibody to SQPV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the same animals; and (iii) mapped cases of the disease, and the gray squirrel distribution, using a geographical information system. We analyzed the distribution of cases of SQPV disease according to woodland type, a measure of squirrel density. SQPV disease occurred only in areas of England also inhabited by seropositive gray squirrels, and as the geographical range of gray squirrels expanded, SQPV disease occurred in these new gray squirrel habitats, supporting a role for the gray squirrel as a reservoir host of the virus. There was a delay between the establishment of invading gray squirrels and cases of the disease in red squirrels which implies gray squirrels must reach a threshold number or density before the virus is transmitted to red squirrels. The spatial and temporal trend in SQPV disease outbreaks suggested that SQPV disease will have a significant effect on Scottish populations of red squirrels within 25 years. The even spread of cases of disease across months suggested a direct rather than vector-borne transmission route is more likely. Eight juvenile and sub-adult free-living red squirrels apparently survived exposure to SQPV by mounting an immune response, the first evidence of immunity to SQPV in free-living red squirrels, which possibly suggests a changing host-parasite relationship and that the use of a vaccine may be an effective management tool to protect remnant red squirrel populations.

TI Genetic diversity of Daphnia magna populations enhances resistance to
   parasites
AB The diversity-disease hypothesis states that decreased genetic diversity in host populations increases the incidence of diseases caused by pathogens (= monoculture effect) and eventually influences ecosystem functioning. The monoculture effect is well-known from crop studies and may be partially specific to the artificial situation in agriculture. The effect received little attention in animal populations of different diversities. Compared with plants, animals are mobile and exhibiting social interactions. We followed the spread of a microsporidian parasite in semi-natural outdoor Daphnia magna populations of low and high genetic diversity. We used randomly, selected, naturally occurring host genotypes. Host populations of low diversity were initially monoclonal, while the host populations of high diversity started with 10 genotypes per replicate. We found that the parasite spread significantly better in host populations of low diversity compared with host populations of high diversity, independent of parasite diversity. The difference was visible over a 3-year period. Host genotypic diversity did not affect host population density. Our experiment demonstrated a monoculture effect in independently replicated semi-natural zooplankton populations, indicating that the monoculture effect may be relevant beyond agriculture.

TI When do host-parasite interactions drive the evolution of non-random
   mating?
AB Interactions with parasites may promote the evolution of disassortative mating in host populations as a mechanism through which genetically diverse offspring can be produced. This possibility has been confirmed through simulation studies and suggested for some empirical systems in which disassortative mating by disease resistance genotype has been documented. The generality of this phenomenon is unclear, however, because existing theory has considered only a subset of possible genetic and mating scenarios. Here we present results from analytical models that consider a broader range of genetic and mating scenarios and allow the evolution of non-random mating in the parasite as well. Our results confirm results of previous simulation studies, demonstrating that coevolutionary interactions with parasites can indeed lead to the evolution of host disassortative mating. However, our results also show that the conditions under which this occurs are significantly more fickle than previously thought, requiring specific forms of infection genetics and modes of non-random mating that do not generate substantial sexual selection. In cases where such conditions are not met, hosts may evolve random or assortative mating. Our analyses also reveal that coevolutionary interactions with hosts cause the evolution of non-random mating in parasites as well. In some cases, particularly those where mating occurs within groups, we find that assortative mating evolves sufficiently to catalyze sympatric speciation in the interacting species.

TI The shape of an ecological trade-off varies with environment
AB Central to most theories that explain the diversity of life is the concept that organisms face trade-offs. Theoretical work has shown that the precise shape of a trade-off relationship affects evolutionary predictions. One common trade-off is that between competitive ability and resistance to predators, parasitoids, pathogens or herbivores. We used a microbial experimental system to elucidate the shape of the relationship between parasitoid resistance and competitive ability. For each of 86 bacteriophage-resistant isolates of the bacterium Escherichia coli B, we measured the degree of resistance to bacteriophage T2 (a viral parasitoid) and relative competitive ability in both the resource environment in which strains were isolated and in two alternate environments. We observed that environmental change can alter trade-off shape, and that different physiological mechanisms can lead to different trade-off shapes and different sensitivities to environmental change. These results highlight the important interaction between environment and trade-off shape in affecting ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

TI The impact of immunization on competition within Plasmodium infections
AB Evolutionary theory argues that ecological interactions between pathogens within an infection can be a potent source of selection shaping traits such as virulence, drug resistance, and infectiousness. In humans, malaria infections are frequently genetically diverse, with mixed genotype infections the norm. A wide variety of evidence shows that crowding occurs within infections, with the population densities of individual genotypes suppressed by the presence of others. Public health interventions are expected to impact on levels of immunity experienced by pathogens, indirectly by reducing the rate of acquisition of natural immunity by reducing the force of infection, and directly in the case of vaccination programs. Here we ask how enhanced host immunity affects competitive interactions between malaria parasites within hosts and thus the strength of in-host selection on traits such as virulence. We used a model malaria system, Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice, where it has been previously shown that less virulent parasites are competitively suppressed by more virulent strains, generating within-host selection for increased virulence. We found that immunization with either a recombinant antigen or with live parasites suppressed parasite densities, but that there was no evidence that immunization relieved or exacerbated competitive suppression, or affected the relative frequency of clones within infections. There is thus no reason to think that immunization strengthens or alleviates the potentially very potent selection on parasite traits arising from interactions between pathogen genotypes within infections.

TI Fungal viral mutualism moderated by ploidy
AB Endosymbionts and their hosts have inherently ambiguous relationships as symbionts typically depend upon their hosts for shelter, nutrition, and reproduction. Endosymbionts can acquire these needs by two alternative strategies: exploitation and cooperation. Parasites exploit hosts to advance their own reproduction at the cost of host fitness. In contrast, mutualists increase their reproductive output by increasing host fitness. Very often the distinction between parasites and mutualists is not discrete but rather contingent on the environment in which the interaction occurs, and can shift along a continuous scale from parasitism to mutualism. The cost benefit dynamics at any point along this continuum are of particular interest as they establish the likelihood of an interaction persisting or breaking down. Here we show how the interaction between the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an endosymbiotic killer virus is strongly dependent on both host ploidy and environmental pH. Additionally we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ploidy-dependent interaction. Understanding these dynamics in the short-term is key to understanding how genetic and environmental factors impact community diversity.

TI Nonadditive genetic components in resistance of the red flour beetle
   Tribolium castanaeum against parasite infection
AB Genetically coupled antagonistic coevolution between host and parasites can select for the maintenance of recombination in the host. Mechanistically, maintenance of recombination relies on epistatic interactions between resistance genes creating linkage disequilibria (LD). The role of epistasis in host resistance traits is however only partly understood. Therefore, we applied the joint scaling principle to assess epistasis and other nonadditive genetic components of two resistance traits, survival, and parasite spore load, in population crosses of the red flour beetle Tribolium castanaeum under infections with the microsporidian Nosema whitei. We found nonadditive components only in infected populations but not in control populations. The genetic architecture underlying survival under parasite infection was more complex than that of spore load. Accordingly, the observed negative correlation between survival and spore load was mainly based on a correlation between shared additive components. Breakdown of resistance was especially strong in F2 crosses between resistant lines indicating that multiple epistatic routes can lead to the same adaptation. In general, the wide range of nonoverlapping genetic components between crosses indicated that parasite resistance in T. castanaeum can be understood as a multi peaked fitness landscape with epistasis contributing substantially to phenotypic differentiation in resistance.

TI The dynamics of health in wild field vole populations: a haematological
   perspective
AB 1. Pathogens have been proposed as potentially important drivers of population dynamics, but while a few studies have investigated the impact of specific pathogens, the wealth of information provided by general indices of health has hardly been exploited. By evaluating haematological parameters in wild populations, our knowledge of the dynamics of health and infection may be better understood.
   2. Here, haematological dynamics in natural populations of field voles are investigated to determine environmental and host factors associated with indicators of inflammatory response (counts of monocytes and neutrophils) and of condition: measures of immunological investment (lymphocyte counts) and aerobic capacity (red blood cell counts).
   3. Individuals from three field vole populations were sampled monthly for 2 years. Comparisons with individuals kept under controlled conditions facilitated interpretation of field data. Mixed effects models were developed for each cell type to evaluate separately the effects of various factors on post-juvenile voles and mature breeding females.
   4. There were three well-characterized 'physiological' seasons. The immunological investment appeared lowest in winter (lowest lymphocyte counts), but red blood cells were at their highest levels and indices of inflammatory response at their lowest. Spring was characterized by a fall in red blood cell counts and peaks in indicators of inflammatory response. During the course of summer-autumn, red blood cell counts recovered, the immunological investment increased and the indicators of inflammatory response decreased.
   5. Poor body condition appeared to affect the inflammatory response (lower neutrophil and monocyte peaks) and the immunological investment (lower lymphocyte counts), providing evidence that the capacity to fight infection is dependent upon host condition.
   6. Breeding early in the year was most likely in females in better condition (high lymphocyte and red blood cell counts).
   7. All the haematological parameters were affected adversely by high population densities.

TI Reproductive compensation
AB The reproductive compensation hypothesis says that individuals constrained by ecological or social forces to reproduce with partners they do not prefer compensate for likely offspring viability deficits. The reproductive compensation hypothesis assumes that (i) pathogens and parasites evolve more rapidly than their hosts, (ii) mate preferences predict variation in health and viability of offspring, (iii) social and ecological factors keep some individuals from mating with their preferred partners (some are constrained to mate with partners they do not prefer), (iv) all individuals may be induced to compensate, so that (v) variation in compensation is due to environmental and developmental factors affecting between-individual abilities to express compensatory mechanisms. Selection favouring compensation may act through variation in prezygotic physiological mechanisms, zygotic mechanisms, or parental care to eggs or young that enhance offspring health, increasing the likelihood that some offspring survive to reproductive age, often at a survival cost to the parents. Compensation may be through increased number of eggs laid or offspring born, a compensatory effort working during a single reproductive bout that sometimes will match the number of offspring surviving to reproductive age produced by unconstrained parents during the same bout. The reproductive compensation hypothesis therefore predicts trade-offs in components of fitness for breeders, such that parents constrained to mating with a nonpreferred partner, but who compensate sometimes match their current productivity (number of offspring at reproductive age) to unconstrained parents (those breeding with their preferred partners), and, when all else is equal, die faster than unconstrained parents. The reproductive compensation hypothesis emphasizes that reproductive competition is not just between constrained and unconstrained individuals, but also among constrained individuals who do and do not compensate. The reproductive compensation hypothesis may thus explain previously unexplained between-population and within-population, between-individual variation in reproductive success, survival, physiology and behaviour.

TI Low migration decreases interference competition among parasites and
   increases virulence
AB Competition among different parasite genotypes within a host is predicted to affect virulence. The direction of this effect, however, depends critically on the mechanisms that parasites use to compete or to cooperate with each other. One mechanism that bacteria use to compete with each other is via the production of bacteria-killing toxins, called bacteriocins. This warfare among parasites within a host is predicted to reduce the rate of host exploitation, resulting in lower virulence. By contrast, if parasites within a host are highly related, there could be a reduction in within-host conflict, increasing virulence. We examined this idea by allowing an insect-parasitic nematode (Steinernema carpocapsae) and its symbiotic bacteria (Xenorhabdus nematophila) to evolve for 20 passages under two different migration treatments (low and high). We found that host mortality rates were higher in the low-migration treatment when compared with the high-migration treatment. In addition, bacteria isolated from the same insect host inhibited each other's growth, but only in the high-migration treatment. These results show that population structure and interactions among parasites within hosts can be critical to understanding virulence.

TI The impact of parasite dispersal on antagonistic host-parasite
   coevolution
AB Coevolving populations of hosts and parasites are often subdivided into a set of patches connected by dispersal. Higher relative rates of parasite compared with host dispersal are expected to lead to parasite local adaptation. However, we know of no studies that have considered the implications of higher relative rates of parasite dispersal for other aspects of the coevolutionary process, such as the rate of coevolution and extent of evolutionary escalation of resistance and infectivity traits. We investigated the effect of phage dispersal on coevolution in experimental metapopulations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its viral parasite, phage SBW25 Phi 2. Both the rate of coevolution and the breadth of evolved infectivity and resistance ranges peaked at intermediate rates of parasite dispersal. These results suggest that parasite dispersal can enhance the evolutionary potential of parasites through provision of novel genetic variation, but that high rates of parasite dispersal can impede the evolution of parasites by homogenizing genetic variation between patches, thereby constraining coevolution.

AB We investigated the factors mediating selection acting on two MHC class II genes (DQA and DRB) in water vole (Arvicola scherman) natural populations in the French Jura Mountains. Population genetics showed significant homogeneity in allelic frequencies at the DQA1 locus as opposed to neutral markers (nine microsatellites), indicating balancing selection acting on this gene. Moreover, almost exhaustive screening for parasites, including gastrointestinal helminths, brain coccidia and antibodies against viruses responsible for zoonoses, was carried out. We applied a co-inertia approach to the genetic and parasitological data sets to avoid statistical problems related to multiple testing. Two alleles, Arte-DRB-11 and Arte-DRB-15, displayed antagonistic associations with the nematode Trichuris arvicolae, revealing the potential parasite-mediated selection acting on DRB locus. Selection mechanisms acting on the two MHC class II genes thus appeared different. Moreover, overdominance as balancing selection mechanism was showed highly unlikely in this system.

TI Adaptation to the most abundant host genotype in an agricultural
   plant-pathogen system - potato late blight
AB This study investigated local adaptation of Phytophthora infestans populations, the causal agent of potato late blight, to two susceptible potato cultivars, each grown for a number of years and over large areas in separate French regions. We measured aggressiveness (quantitative pathogenicity) of each pathogen population to sympatric and allopatric hosts in a reciprocal cross-inoculation experiment. There was no evidence for specific host adaptation in this pathosystem. At both local and regional scales, the distribution of aggressiveness fits a pattern of adaptation to the most common host genotype. Our observations support the theoretical predictions that large pathogen dispersal rates and genetic drift, revealed by the comparisons of the genotypic structures of the populations tested, can lead to a local adaptation pattern detectable only at a large spatial scale. The unravelling of adaptive patterns at different spatial scales can be used for a more efficient management of the disease.

TI Temperature-dependent costs of parasitism and maintenance of
   polymorphism under genotype-by-environment interactions
AB The maintenance of genetic variation for infection-related traits is often attributed to coevolution between hosts and parasites, but it can also be maintained by environmental variation if the relative fitness of different genotypes changes with environmental variation. To gain insight into how infection-related traits are sensitive to environmental variation, we exposed a single host genotype of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna to four parasite isolates (which we assume to represent different genotypes) of its naturally co-occurring parasite Pasteuria ramosa at 15, 20 and 25 degrees C. We found that the cost to the host of becoming infected varied with temperature, but the magnitude of this cost did not depend on the parasite isolate. Temperature influenced parasite fitness traits; we found parasite genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions for parasite transmission stage production, suggesting the potential for temperature variation to maintain genetic variation in this trait. Finally, we tested for temperature-dependent relationships between host and parasite fitness traits that form a key component of models of virulence evolution, and we found them to be stable across temperatures.

TI HIV-1 transmission, by stage of infection
AB Background. The epidemiological impact of public health interventions targeted at reducing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) during early or late-stage infection depends on the contribution of these disease stages to transmission within a particular epidemic.
   Methods. Transmission hazards and durations of periods of high infectivity during primary, asymptomatic, and late-stage infection were estimated for HIV-1-serodiscordant heterosexual couples in Rakai, Uganda, by use of a robust probabilistic framework.
   Results. Primary infection and late-stage infection were estimated to be 26 and 7 times, respectively, more infectious than asymptomatic infection. High infectiousness during primary infection was estimated to last for similar to 3 months after seroconversion, whereas high infectiousness during late-stage infection was estimated to be concentrated between 19 months and 10 months before death.
   Conclusions. Primary and late-stage HIV-1 infection are more infectious than previously estimated, but for shorter periods. In a homogeneous population, the asymptomatic stage of infection will typically contribute more to the net transmission of HIV-1 over the lifetime of an infected individual, because of its longer duration. The dependence of the relative contribution of infectious stages on patterns of sexual behavior and the phase of epidemics is discussed.

AB Background. The literature on the involvement of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS) is conflicting. Polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene reduce the level of protein and alter its structure. Thus, we investigated whether MBL2 alleles and plasma concentrations of MBL are associated with perinatal HIV transmission and disease progression.
   Methods. Frequencies of MBL2 allelic variants ( B, C, D, and X) were estimated among 345 HIV-exposed children and 147 blood donors. AIDS-free time was evaluated for different MBL2 genotypes and MBL plasma levels. The median duration of follow-up was 96.5 months.
   Results. In the Argentinean population, gene frequencies of MBL2 variants were 18%, 15%, and 3% for the X, B, and D alleles, respectively, with no identified C allele. The haplotype XA/XA was associated with an 8-fold risk of acquiring HIV-1 (P = .054; odds ratio [OR], 8.11 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.96-67.86]) and almost a 3-fold risk of progression to pediatric AIDS (P = .026; OR, 2.81 [ 95% CI, 1.14-7.47]). We also found an independent positive correlation between the rate of AIDS progression and MBL plasma concentration (P = .008; OR, 1.28 [ 95% CI, 1.07-1.55]).
   Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that homozygosity for the MBL2 promoter genotype XA/XA is an important genetic determinant of HIV-1 acquisition through vertical transmission and the pathogenesis of pediatric HIV/AIDS, via a mechanism that remains to be established.

TI Variation in the major surface glycoprotein genes in Pneumocystis
   jirovecii
AB The genome of Pneumocystis, which causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, contains a multicopy gene family that encodes the major surface glycoprotein (Msg). Pneumocystis can vary the expressed Msg, presumably as a mechanism to avoid host immune responses. Analysis of 24 msg-gene sequences obtained from a singlehumanisolate of Pneumocystis demonstrated that the sequences segregate into 2 branches. Results of a number of analyses suggest that recombination between msg genes is an important mechanism for generating msg diversity. Intrabranch recombination occurred more frequently than interbranch recombination. Restriction-fragment length polymorphism analysis of human isolates of Pneumocystis demonstrated substantial variation in the repertoire of the msg-gene family, variation that was not observed in laboratory isolates of Pneumocystis in rats or mice; this may be the result of examining outbred versus captive populations. Increased diversity in the Msg repertoire, generated in part by recombination, increases the potential for antigenic variation in this abundant surface protein.

TI Experimental expansion of the regulatory T cell population increases
   resistance to African trypanosomiasis
AB Inflammatory responses mounted to eliminate parasites can be lethal if not counterbalanced by regulatory responses protecting the host from collateral tissue damage. Here, we show that the maintained inflammation associated with tissue damage, anemia, and reduced survival of Trypanosoma brucei-infected mice correlates with the absence of the expansion of the regulatory T (T(reg)) cell population. Induction of Treg cell expansion via CD28 superagonist antibody treatment in these mice down-regulated interferon-gamma production by T cells and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and reactive oxygen species production by classically activated macrophages, triggered the development of alternatively activated macrophages, delayed the onset of liver injury, diminished the anemia burden, and prolonged the survival of infected animals. Thus, triggering the expansion of the T(reg) cell population coupled with the induction of alternatively activated macrophages can restore the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signals and thereby limit the pathogenicity of African trypanosomiasis.

TI Genetic variation affecting host-parasite interactions: major-effect
   quantitative trait loci affect the transmission of sigma virus in
   Drosophila melanogaster
AB In natural populations, genetic variation affects resistance to disease. Whether that genetic variation comprises lots of small-effect polymorphisms or a small number of large-effect polymorphisms has implications for adaptation, selection and how genetic variation is maintained in populations, Furthermore, how much genetic variation there is, and the genes that underlie this variation, affects models of co-evolution between parasites and their hosts. We are studying the genetic variation that affects the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster to its natural pathogen - the vertically transmitted sigma virus. We have carried out three separate quantitative trait locus mapping analyses to map gene variants on the second chromosome that cause variation in the rate at which males transmit the infection to their offspring. All three crosses identified a locus in a similar chromosomal location that causes a large drop in the rate at which the virus is transmitted. We also found evidence for an additional smaller-effect quantitative trait locus elsewhere on the chromosome. Our data, together with previous experiments on the sigma virus and parasitoid wasps, indicate that the resistance of D. melanogaster to co-evolved pathogens is controlled by a limited number of major-effect polymorphisms.

TI A test of host-associated differentiation across the 'parasite
   continuum' in the tri-trophic interaction among yuccas, bogus yucca
   moths, and parasitoids
AB Parasitic taxa span an antagonistic continuum, with some parasites inflicting no fitness costs to some that kill the host after feeding. Host-associated differentiation is postulated as a major process facilitating speciation in many parasitic taxa. Here, I examined the importance of host-associated differentiation in a parasitoid wasp that develops on yucca moths in the genus Prodoxus. Prodoxus are specialists on Yucca, and moth speciation is closely tied to differences in microhabitat use within a plant and among host plant species. Parasitoids in the genus Eusandalum have been reared from Prodoxus species distributed across Yucca. Estimates of host-use patterns obtained through rearings of adult wasps were combined with surveys of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I sequence data and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to determine if populations of Eusandalum were genetically structured based on host use. Eusandalum populations were genetically structured based on geographical distance rather than moth host species, microhabitats within plants, or Yucca species. The results are contrary to the patterns observed in the host genus Prodoxus. Although parasitoids exhibit parasite-like characteristics, these results suggest that Eusandalum may be best viewed as a predator. Female wasps are able to utilize any moth species present at a given locality, and there is little likelihood that host specialization may facilitate population subdivision and speciation.

TI Globally panmictic population structure in the opportunistic fungal
   pathogen Aspergillus sydowii
AB Recent outbreaks of new diseases in many ecosystems are caused by novel pathogens, impaired host immunity, or changing environmental conditions. Identifying the source of emergent pathogens is critical for mitigating the impacts of diseases, and understanding the cause of their recent appearances. One ecosystem suffering outbreaks of disease in the past decades is coral reefs, where pathogens such as the fungus Aspergillus sydowii have caused catastrophic population declines in their hosts. Aspergillosis is one of the best-characterized coral diseases, yet the origin of this typically terrestrial fungus in marine systems remains unknown. We examined the genetic structure of a global sample of A. sydowii, including isolates from diseased corals, diseased humans, and environmental sources. Twelve microsatellite markers reveal a pattern of global panmixia among the fungal isolates. A single origin of the pathogen into marine systems seems unlikely given the lack of isolation by distance and lack of evidence for a recent bottleneck. A neighbour-joining phylogeny shows that sea fan isolates are interspersed with environmental isolates, suggesting there have been multiple introductions from land into the ocean. Overall, our results underscore that A. sydowii is a true opportunist, with a diversity of nonrelated isolates able to cause disease in corals. This study highlights the challenge in distinguishing between the role of environment in allowing opportunistic pathogens to increase and actual introductions of new pathogenic microorganisms for coral diseases.

TI Needles in the EST Haystack: Large-Scale Identification and Analysis of
   Excretory-Secretory (ES) Proteins in Parasitic Nematodes Using Expressed
   Sequence Tags (ESTs)
AB Background: Parasitic nematodes of humans, other animals and plants continue to impose a significant public health and economic burden worldwide, due to the diseases they cause. Promising antiparasitic drug and vaccine candidates have been discovered from excreted or secreted (ES) proteins released from the parasite and exposed to the immune system of the host. Mining the entire expressed sequence tag (EST) data available from parasitic nematodes represents an approach to discover such ES targets.
   Methods and Findings: In this study, we predicted, using EST2Secretome, a novel, high-throughput, computational workflow system, 4,710 ES proteins from 452,134 ESTs derived from 39 different species of nematodes, parasitic in animals (including humans) or plants. In total, 2,632, 786, and 1,292 ES proteins were predicted for animal-, human-, and plant-parasitic nematodes. Subsequently, we systematically analysed ES proteins using computational methods. Of these 4,710 proteins, 2,490 (52.8%) had orthologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas 621 (13.8%) appeared to be novel, currently having no significant match to any molecule available in public databases. Of the C. elegans homologues, 267 had strong "loss-of-function'' phenotypes by RNA interference (RNAi) in this nematode. We could functionally classify 1,948 (41.3%) sequences using the Gene Ontology (GO) terms, establish pathway associations for 573 (12.2%) sequences using Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and identify protein interaction partners for 1,774 (37.6%) molecules. We also mapped 758 (16.1%) proteins to protein domains including the nematode-specific protein family "transthyretin-like'' and "chromadorea ALT,'' considered as vaccine candidates against filariasis in humans.
   Conclusions: We report the large-scale analysis of ES proteins inferred from EST data for a range of parasitic nematodes. This set of ES proteins provides an inventory of known and novel members of ES proteins as a foundation for studies focused on understanding the biology of parasitic nematodes and their interactions with their hosts, as well as for the development of novel drugs or vaccines for parasite intervention and control.

TI Characteristics of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) glycoprotein 120 env sequences in
   mother-infant pairs infected with HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE
AB We analyzed the characteristics of the envelope genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in 17 mother-infant pairs infected with variants of the CRF01_ AE clade. A total of 353 sequences covering almost the entire glycoprotein (gp) 120 region were available for analysis. We found that, even if the virus population in the mother was complex, only viruses of a restricted subset were transmitted to her infant, independently of whether transmission occurred in utero or during the intrapartum period. We did not find that shorter gp120 regions or fewer potential N- glycosylation sites(PNGS) were characteristic of viruses transmitted from mother to infant. However, our data suggest that a limited number of PNGS that seem to be conserved in all variants in infants but are not uniformly present in variants in mothers may confer an advantage for transmission of the virus, thereby highlighting the potentially important role of the " glycan shield." This finding was particularly significant for the PNGS at positions N301 and N384.

   : Culicidae) in the northeastern United States by using microsatellite
   analysis
AB Members of the Culex pipiens complex are considered as biting nuisance and vectors of important arboviruses including West Nile virus (WNV). To analyze the genetic structure of urban and rural populations of Cx. pipiens form pipiens and gain insights into behavioral implications, mosquitoes were collected from established WNV transmission foci in Connecticut from October 2006 through October 2007, examined by using microsatellite markers, and compared with other populations from neighboring states in the northeastern United States. The mean numbers of alleles per locus for the aboveground Cx. pipiens form pipiens populations ranged from 11.5 +/- 2.3 to 13.2 +/- 2.4 and were not significantly different. In contrast, Cx. pipiens form molestus had greatly reduced allelic diversities with an average of 4.4 +/- 1.2 alleles per locus, which was significantly lower than that of any of the Cx. pipiens form pipiens populations analyzed. We did not detect significant genetic differences between urban and rural populations of Cx. pipiens form pipiens from Connecticut nor did we observe temporal genetic changes. However, in a comparative analysis with populations of neighboring states, New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts, genetic variations associated with geographic distance were identified. In the analyses of Bayesian clustering and principal component analysis, we identified two clusters separating Cx. pipiens form molestus from Cx. pipiens form pipiens populations, indicating that Cx. pipiens form molestus was genetically distinct from any of the Cx. pipiens form pipiens populations examined during this study.

TI Impregnated netting slows infestation by Triatoma infestans
AB We used sentinel animal enclosures to measure the rate of infestation by the Chagas disease vector, Triatoma infestans, in an urban community of Arequipa, Peru, and to evaluate the effect of deltamethrin-impregnated netting on that rate. Impregnated netting decreased the rate of infestation of sentinel enclosures (rate ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.38; P < 0.001), controlling for the density of surrounding vector populations and the distance of these to the sentinel enclosures. Most migrant insects were early-stage nymphs, which are less likely to carry the parasitic agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi. Spread of the vector in the city therefore likely precedes spread of the parasite. Netting was particularly effective against adult insects and late-stage nymphs; taking into account population structure, netting decreased the reproductive value of migrant populations from 443.6 to 40.5. Impregnated netting can slow the spread of T. infestans and is a potentially valuable tool in the control of Chagas disease.

TI Predictive spatial models for risk of West Nile virus exposure in

AB In the absence of a vaccine for use in humans against West Nile virus (WNV), mosquito control and personal protection against mosquito bites are the only measures available to prevent disease. Improved spatial targeting is desirable for costly mosquito and WNV surveillance and control schemes. We used a multivariate regression modeling approach to develop spatial models predicting high risk of exposure to WNV in western and eastern Colorado based on associations between Geographic Information System-derived environmental data and zip code of residence for 3,659 human WNV disease cases from 2002 to 2006. Models were robust, with user accuracies for correct classification of high risk areas of 67-80%. The importance of selecting a suitable model development area in an ecologically and climatically diverse environment was shown by models based on data from the eastern plains landscape performing poorly in the mountainous western part of Colorado and vice versa.

TI Exclusion of generalist pathogens in multihost communities
AB Knowing how to control a pathogen that infects more than one host species is of increasing importance because the incidence of such infections grows with continuing environmental change. Of concern are infections transmitted from wildlife to humans or livestock. To determine which options are available to control a pathogen in these circumstances, we analyze the pathogen invasion matrix for the multihost susceptible-infected-susceptible model. We highlight the importance of both community structure and the column sum or row sum index, an indicator of both force of infection and community stability. We derive a set of guidelines for constructing culling strategies and suggest a hybrid strategy that has the advantages of both the bottom-up and the top-down approaches, which we study in some detail. The analysis holds for an arbitrary number of host species, enabling the analysis of large-scale ecological systems and systems with spatial dimensions. We test the robustness of our methods by making two changes in the structure of the underlying dynamic model, adding direct competition and introducing frequency-dependent infection transmission. In particular, we show that the introduction of an additional host can eliminate the pathogen rather than eliminate the resident host. The discussion is illustrated with a reference to bovine tuberculosis.

TI Multiple infections, immune dynamics, and the evolution of virulence
AB Understanding the effect of multiple infections is essential for the prediction (and eventual control) of virulence evolution. Some theoretical studies have considered the possibility that several strains coexist in the same host (coinfection), but few have taken their within-host dynamics explicitly into account. Here, we develop a nested approach based on a simple model for the interaction of parasite strains with their host's immune system. We study virulence evolution by linking the within-host dynamics to an epidemiological framework that incorporates multiple infections. Our model suggests that antigenically similar parasite strains cannot coexist in the long term inside a host. We also find that the optimal level of virulence increases with the efficiency of multiple infections. Finally, we notice that coinfections create heterogeneity in the host population (with susceptible hosts and infected hosts), which can lead to evolutionary branching in the parasite population and the emergence of a hypervirulent parasite strategy. We interpret this result as a parasite specialization to the infectious state of the hosts. Our study has experimental and theoretical implications in a virulence management perspective.

TI FESTERING FOOD: CHYTRIDIOMYCETE PATHOGEN REDUCES QUALITY OF DAPHNIA HOST
   AS A FOOD RESOURCE
AB When parasitic infections are severe or highly prevalent among prey, a significant component of the predator's diet may consist of parasitized hosts. However, despite the ubiquity of parasites in most food webs, comparisons of the nutritional quality of prey as a function of infection status are largely absent. We measured the nutritional consequences of chytridiomycete infections in Daphnia, which achieve high prevalence in lake ecosystems (> 80%), and tested the hypothesis that Daphnia pulicaria infected with Polycaryum laeve are diminished in food quality relative to uninfected hosts. Compared with uninfected adults, infected individuals were smaller, contained less nitrogen and phosphorus, and were lower in several important fatty acids. Infected zooplankton had significantly shorter carapace lengths (8%) and lower mass (8-20%) than uninfected individuals. Parasitized animals contained significantly less phosphorus (16-18% less by dry mass) and nitrogen (4-6% less) than did healthy individuals. Infected individuals also contained 26-34% less saturated fatty acid and 31-42% less docosahexaenoic acid, an essential fatty acid that is typically low in cladocera, but critical to fish growth. Our results suggest that naturally occurring levels of chytrid infections in D. pulicaria populations reduce the quality of food available to secondary consumers, including planktivorous fishes, with potentially important effects for lake food webs.

TI Diversity and disease: community structure drives parasite transmission
   and host fitness
AB Changes in host diversity and community structure have been linked to disease, but the mechanisms underlying such relationships and their applicability to non-vector-borne disease systems remain conjectural. Here we experimentally investigated how changes in host community structure affected the transmission and pathology of the multi-host parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae, which is a widespread cause of amphibian limb deformities. We exposed larval amphibians to parasites in monospecific or heterospecific communities, and varied host number to differentiate between density- and diversity-mediated effects on transmission. In monospecific communities, exposure to Ribeiroia significantly increased mortality (15%), malformations (40%) and time-to-metamorphosis in toads. However, the presence of tree frogs significantly reduced infection in toads, leading to fewer malformations and higher survival than observed in monospecific communities, providing evidence of parasite-mediated facilitation. Our results suggest that interspecific variation in parasite resistance can inhibit parasite transmission in multi-species communities, reducing infection and pathology in sensitive hosts.

TI Ecological factors associated with west nile virus transmission,
   northeastern United States
AB Since 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) disease has affected the northeastern United States. To describe the spatial epidemiology and identify risk factors for disease incidence, we analyzed 8 years (1999-2006) of county-based human WNV disease surveillance data. Among the 56.6 million residents in 8 northeastern states sharing primary enzootic vectors, we found 977 cases. We controlled for population density and potential bias from surveillance and spatial proximity. Analyses demonstrated significant spatial spreading from 1999 through 2004 (p<0.01, r(2) = 0.16). A significant trend was apparent among increasingly urban counties; county quartiles with the least (<38%) forest cover had 4.4-fold greater odds (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-13.2, p = 0.01) of having above-median disease incidence (>0.75 cases/100,000 residents) than counties with the most (>70%) forest cover. These results quantify urbanization as a risk factor for WNV disease incidence and are consistent with knowledge of vector species in this area.

A theoretical SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model was used to study the effect Of the function used Oil simulated results. With a constant total population size. different equilibrium values for the number of infectious (NI) were reached. depending on the transmission function used. With in increasing population size, the transmission functions could be assimilated to either density-dependent (DD), where an equilibrium was obtained, or frequency-dependent (FD), with an exponential increase in NI. An analytical Study corroborated file simulated results. As a Conclusion, the choice between the different transmission functions, particularly between DD and FD. Must be carefully Considered for a varying Population size.

TI Host-driven divergence in the parasitic plant Orobanche minor Sm.
   (Orobanchaceae)
AB Many parasitic angiosperms have a broad host range and are therefore considered to be host generalists. Orobanche minor is a nonphotosynthetic root parasite that attacks a range of hosts from taxonomically disparate families. In the present study, we show that O. minor sensu lato may comprise distinct, genetically divergent races isolated by the different ecologies of their hosts. Using a three-pronged approach, we tested the hypothesis that intraspecific taxa O. minor var. minor and O. minor ssp. maritima parasitizing either clover (Trifolium pratense) or sea carrot (Daucus carota ssp. gummifer), respectively, are in allopatric isolation. Morphometric analysis revealed evidence of divergence but this was insufficient to define discrete, host-specific taxa. Intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker-based data provided stronger evidence of divergence, suggesting that populations were isolated from gene flow. Phylogenetic analysis, using sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers derived from ISSR loci, provided strong evidence for divergence by clearly differentiating sea carrot-specific clades and mixed-host clades. Low levels of intrapopulation SCAR marker sequence variation and floral morphology suggest that populations on different hosts are probably selfing and inbreeding. Morphologically cryptic Orobanche taxa may therefore be isolated from gene flow by host ecology. Together, these data suggest that host specificity may be an important driver of allopatric speciation in parasitic plants.

   americanum
AB To quantify microbial composition and interactions, we identified prokaryotic communities in the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and direct probing. The lone star tick is the vector of emerging diseases and host to additional symbionts of unknown activity, and is representative of other blood-sucking arthropods. We evaluated the potential for vertical (transovarial) transmission by molecular analysis of microbial symbionts from egg and larval clutches. Direct probing of adults (N = 8 populations from the southeastern and midwestern USA, 900 ticks total) revealed three vertically transmitted symbionts: a Coxiella symbiont occurred at 100% frequency, Rickettsia species occurred in 45-61% of all ticks in every population and an Arsenophonus symbiont occurred in 0-90% of ticks per population. Arsenophonus and Rickettsia exhibited significant heterogeneity in frequency among populations. The human pathogens Ehrlichia chafeensis and Borrelia lonestari were rare in most populations. Additional microbes were detected sporadically. Most ticks (78%) were co-infected by two or three microbes but statistical analysis indicated no significant deviation from random co-occurrence. Our findings indicate that microbial communities within lone star ticks are diverse, and suggest that direct probing for a wider range of prokaryotes and application of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may provide further insights into microbial interactions within disease vectors. Our results also emphasize the close phylogenetic relationship between tick symbionts and human pathogens, and consistent differences in their prevalence.

TI Between a whale bone and the deep blue sea: the provenance of dwarf
   males in whale bone-eating tubeworms
AB When researchers first caught a glimpse of the lush carpet of pink tubeworms covering the scattered bones of a dead grey whale 2900 m below the surface of Monterey Bay, the excitement onboard the Western Flyer (the mother ship of the remotely operated vehicle the Tiburon) must have been electrifying. The discovery of a new genus and several species of whale bone-eating Osedax tubeworms (Annelida, Siboglinidae) a mere 6 years ago from the deep sea was itself noteworthy. But what the researchers peering into the video monitors aboard the Western Flyer could not have known at that moment was that in the gelatinous tubes of those worms clung even more peculiar forms: harems of tiny, paedomorphic males of Osedax, numbering in the hundreds at times. Whereas female tubeworms bore into the marrow of whale bones (possibly via enzymes from their endosymbiotic bacteria), the dwarf males secondarily colonize the tubes of the resident females. The number of males in a female's tube increases over time in a curvilinear fashion. Dwarf males are known from all Osedax species examined to date, yet the origin of the males was an open question. In this issue, Vrijenhoek et al. provide compelling evidence that dwarf males found in the tubes of female Osedax worms are derived from a common larval pool and are unlikely to be the sons of host females or the progeny of females in the local genetic neighbourhood. This study provides an important foundation for future work on the ecology and evolution of extreme male dwarfism in Osedax and sexual size dimorphism more generally.

TI Clonal population structure of the chestnut blight fungus in expanding
   ranges in southeastern Europe
AB Expanding populations are often less genetically diverse at their margins than at the centre of a species' range. Established, older populations of the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, are more variable for vegetative compatibility (vc) types than in expanding populations in southeastern Europe where C. parasitica has colonized relatively recently. To test whether vc types represent clones, we genotyped 373 isolates of C. parasitica from southern Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey using 11 sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. Ten SCAR loci and six vegetative incompatibility (vic) loci were polymorphic in these samples. These populations are clonal by all criteria tested: (i) among 373 isolates, we found only eight multilocus haplotypes, and the same haplotypes were found in multiple countries, sometimes separated in time by as much as 12 years; (ii) the number of haplotypes observed was significantly less than expected under random mating; (iii) populations are in linkage disequilibrium; (iv) the two sets of independent markers, SCARs and vc types, are highly correlated; and (v) sexual structures of C. parasitica were found only in Bulgaria and Romania. One mating type (MAT-1) was found in 98% of the isolates sampled. In contrast, a population in northern Italy, in the central part of the range in Europe, had 12 multilocus haplotypes among 19 isolates. The spread of a few clones could be the result either of founder effect and restricted migration, or these clones have greater fitness than others and spread because they are better adapted to conditions in southeastern Europe.

TI Phylogeography of post-Pleistocene population expansion in a
   fungus-gardening ant and its microbial mutualists
AB Although historical biogeographical forces, such as climate-driven range shifts, greatly influence the present-day population genetic structure of animals and plants, the extent to which they affect microbial communities remains largely unknown. We examined the effect of postglacial expansion on the population structure of the northern fungus-gardening ant Trachymyrmex septentrionalis and compared it with that of its two microbial mutualists: a community of lepiotaceous fungal cultivars and associated antibiotic-producing Pseudonocardia bacteria. The ant population genetic structure showed signs of population expansion and subdivision into eastern and western phylogroups that likely originated in the Pleistocene - a pattern shared by many other North American taxa found in the same region. Although dispersal limitation was present in all three symbionts, as suggested by genetic isolation increasing with distance, the host's east-west subdivision of population genetic structure was absent from the microbial mutualist populations. While neither the cultivar nor the Pseudonocardia genetic structure was correlated with that of the ants, they were significantly correlated with each other. These results show that biogeographical forces may act differently on macro- and microscopic organisms, even in the extreme case where microbial mutualists are vertically transmitted from generation to generation and share the same joint ecological niche. It may be that historical climate change played a larger role in determining the population structure of the ant hosts, whereas present-day environmental forces, such as pathogen pressure, determine the structure of associated microbial populations.

TI Avian haematozoan parasites and their associations with mosquitoes
   across Southwest Pacific Islands
AB The degree to which haematozoan parasites can exploit a range of vectors and hosts has both ecological and evolutionary implications for their transmission and biogeography. Here we explore the extent to which closely related mosquito species share the same or closely related haematozoan parasites, and examine the overlap in parasite lineages with those isolated from avian hosts, Zosterops species, sampled across the same study sites. Mosquito samples were collected and analysed (14 species, n = 804) from four islands in Vanuatu and the main island of New Caledonia. Using polymerase chain reaction, 15.5% (14/90) of pooled mosquito (thoracic) samples showed positive amplifications. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the cytochrome b gene identified four genetically distinct Plasmodium and two Haemoproteus lineages from these samples, five of which were identical to parasite lineages (n = 21) retrieved from the avian hosts. We found that three Plasmodium lineages differing by a maximum of 0.9% sequence divergence were recovered from different species and genera of mosquitoes and two Haemoproteus lineages differing by 4.6% sequence divergence were carried by 10 distantly related (11-21% divergent) mosquito species. These data suggest a lack of both cospeciation and invertebrate host conservatism. Without experimental demonstration of the transmission cycle, it is not possible to establish whether these mosquitoes are the biological vectors of isolated parasite lineages, reflecting a limitation of a purely polymerase chain reaction-based approach. Nonetheless, our results raise the possibility of a new transmission pathway and highlight extensive invertebrate host shifts in an insular mosquito-parasite system.

The sequence analysis showed that the roe deer is a susceptible host for several piroplasms belonging both to Babesia (31%) and Theileria (14.2%) species, whereas fallow deer and wild boar harbor only Theileria species (49% and 2.6%, respectively). Strains related to B. divergens are highly present (28.3%) in the roe deer, which, however, also harbors Babesia MO1 type and Babesia microti-like organisms. Babesia EU1 type is described for the first time in a roe deer in Italy. The finding in roe deer of Babesia species involved in human babesiosis is of concern for public health, mainly because ecological changes in progress cause the increase of both the deer species and the vector tick populations.

TI Rapidly cleared episodes of herpes simplex virus reactivation in
   immunocompetent adults
AB Background. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) remains latent in nerve root ganglia of infected persons and is thought to reactivate several times yearly. Recent in situ data show the localization of HSV-specific CD8(+) T cells at the dermal epidermal junction next to peripheral sensory nerve endings, suggesting that viral reactivation may occur more frequently than previously appreciated.
   Methods. Twenty-five HSV-2-seropositive and 18 HSV-1-seropositive healthy adults collected anogenital and oral swabs, respectively, 4 times per day for 60 days. Swabs were assayed for HSV, using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.
   Results. Twenty-four percent of anogenital reactivations and 21% of oral reactivations lasted <= 6 h, and 49% of anogenital reactivations and 39% of oral reactivations lasted <= 12 h. Lesions were reported in only 3 (7%) of 44 anogenital reactivations and 1 (8%) of 13 oral reactivations lasting <= 12 h. The median HSV DNA levels at initial and last detection were 10(3.5) and 10(3.3) copies/mL, respectively, during anogenital reactivation and 10(3.7) and 10(3.0) copies/mL, respectively, during oral reactivation.
   Conclusions. This high frequency of short subclinical HSV reactivation in immunocompetent hosts strongly suggests that the peripheral mucosal immune system plays a critical role in clearing HSV reactivations.

TI Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission Cycle Among Wild and Domestic Mammals in
   Three Areas of Orally Transmitted Chagas Disease Outbreaks
AB We report Trypanosoma cruzi infection in wild and domestic mammals from three orally acquired Chagas disease outbreak areas in Brazil. Cachoeiro do Arari (Pari) displayed a panzootic scenery (positive mammals in all ecologic strata), and human cases were probably the consequence of their exposure within the sylvatic T cruzi transmission cycle. In Navegantes (Santa Catarina), Didelphis spp. was the main reservoir host, given that 93% were infected. In Redencao (Ceara), Monodelphis domestica and Thrichomys laterentius were also important for parasite maintenance. TCI was present in the three studied areas. Additionally. Z3 was detected in an armadillo from Pari and TCII in a triatomine from Navegantes. Domestic animals showed a high seroprevalence and should be considered sentinels in surveillance programs. The importance of a reduction in wild mammalian fauna diversity and selection of suitable T cruzi reservoir hosts are discussed as risk factors for the re-emergence of Chagas disease.

TI Using Mechanistic Models to Understand Synchrony in Forest Insect
   Populations: The North American Gypsy Moth as a Case Study
AB In many forest insects, subpopulations fluctuate concurrently across large geographical areas, a phenomenon known as population synchrony. Because of the large spatial scales involved, empirical tests to identify the causes of synchrony are often impractical. Simple models are, therefore, a useful aid to understanding, but data often seem to contradict model predictions. For instance, chaotic population dynamics and limited dispersal are not uncommon among synchronous forest defoliators, yet both make it difficult to achieve synchrony in simple models. To test whether this discrepancy can be explained by more realistic models, we introduced dispersal and spatially correlated stochasticity into a mechanistic population model for the North American gypsy moth Lymantria dispar. The resulting model shows both chaotic dynamics and spatial synchrony, suggesting that chaos and synchrony can be reconciled by the incorporation of realistic dynamics and spatial structure. By relating alterations in model structure to changes in synchrony levels, we show that the synchrony is due to a combination of spatial co-variance in environmental stochasticity and the origins of chaos in our multispecies model.

TI COMPARATIVE TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS OF COMPETING PARASITE SPECIES
AB Competition-colonization trade-off models explain the coexistence of competing species in terms of a trade-off between competitive ability and the ability to colonize competitor-free patches of habitat. A simple prediction of these models is that inferior competitors will be superior dispersers. This prediction has seldom been tested in natural populations because measuring dispersal is difficult. Host-parasite systems are promising in this regard, especially those involving "permanent'' parasites that complete their entire life cycle on the body of the host. Because of this close association with the host, the dispersal, i.e., transmission, of these parasites can be monitored very accurately. We tested the dispersal prediction of the competition-colonization model by documenting the transmission dynamics of feather-feeding lice, which are permanent, relatively host-specific parasites of birds. We compared two groups known as "wing'' lice and "body'' lice that are common parasites of Rock Pigeons (Columba livia Gmelin). The two groups are ecologically similar, and they compete for resources on the host. Previous work shows that body lice are competitively superior to wing lice, leading us to predict that wing lice should be better than body lice at dispersing to new host individuals. We tested this prediction by comparing the ability of wing and body lice to disperse between hosts using vertical- and horizontal-transmission mechanisms, including phoretic hitchhiking on parasitic flies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae). A series of experiments with both captive and wild birds confirmed that wing lice are much better than body lice at colonizing new hosts. Wing lice showed significantly greater vertical transmission to nestlings, and they were quite capable of phoretic transmission to new hosts on flies. In contrast, body lice were not phoretic. These results provide the first rigorous demonstration of phoretic transmission in lice, and they underscore the importance of a community-level approach to understanding the ecology of parasite transmission dynamics.

TI Rapid evolution buffers ecosystem impacts of viruses in a microbial food
   web
AB Predation and parasitism often regulate population dynamics, community interactions, and ecosystem functioning. The strength of these top-down pressures is variable, however, and may be influenced by both ecological and evolutionary processes. We conducted a chemostat experiment to assess the direct and indirect effects of viruses on a marine microbial food web comprised of an autotrophic host (Synechococcus) and nontarget heterotrophic bacteria. Viruses dramatically altered the host population dynamics, which in turn influenced phosphorus resource availability and the stoichiometric allocation of nutrients into microbial biomass. These virus effects diminished with time, but could not be attributed to changes in the abundance or composition of heterotrophic bacteria. Instead, attenuation of the virus effects coincided with the detection of resistant host phenotypes, suggesting that rapid evolution buffered the effect of viruses on nutrient cycling. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary processes are important for community dynamics and ecosystem processes on ecologically relevant time scales.

TI Inferior rabies vaccine quality and low immunization coverage in dogs
   (Canis familiaris) in China
AB Human rabies in China continues to increase exponentially, largely due to all inadequate veterinary infrastructure and poor vaccine coverage of naive dogs. We performed an epidemiological survey of rabies both in humans and animals, examined vaccine duality for animal use, evaluated the vaccination coverage in dogs, and checked the dog samples for the presence of rabies virus. The lack of surveillance in dog rabies, together with the low immunization coverage (up to 2.8 % in rural areas) and the high percentage of rabies virus prevalence (up to 6.4%) in dogs. suggests that the dog population is a continual threat for rabies transmission from dogs to humans in China. Results also indicated that the quality of rabies vaccines for animal use did not satisfy all of the requirements for all efficacious vaccine capable of fully eliminating rabies. These data Suggest that the factors noted above are highly correlated with the high incidence of human rabies in China.

TI Seroprevalence of parvovirus B19 in the German population
AB Acute parvovirus B19 infection is a risk for pregnant women. After vertical transmission the infected fetus may develop hydrops fetalis. Since B19 infection Occurs mainly during childhood, children represent a main source for virus transmission. In order to determine whether certain groups in the German population Show increased risks for B19 infection we analysed the seroprevalence using 6583 sera collected from adults in former Eastern and Western Germany during the German National Health Survey and 649 sera from healthy Thuringian children and adolescents. In adults the overall seroprevalence was 72.1% rising from 20.4% in children (1-3 years) and 66.9% in adolescents (18-19 years) to 79.1% in the elderly (65-69 years). Significant differences were observed between females (73.3 %) and males (70.9%) and between inhabitants of small (74.8%) and big cities (69.0%) but not between people of the former Eastern (72.8%) and Western states (72.0%) of Germany. For women during childbearing age (18-49 years) highest values were observed in those living together with two or more children (81.6%) and in women with occupational contact with children aged < 6 years (88.9%). In contrast seroprevalence was significantly lower in age-matched Female singles (64.8%) and in women with Occupational contact with children aged >6 years and adolescents (63.8%).

TI Cross-disciplinary demands of multihost pathogens
AB The dynamics of infectious disease spread depend on host population contact structure. Heterogeneities in this contact structure can arise from various forms of demographic and spatial phenomena. Craft et al. (this issue) have constructed an exploratory simulation model of the spread of canine distemper virus through a multispecies carnivore community. Each species in this community is modelled with a contact structure reflecting host social organization, ranging behaviour, and likely interspecific contact patterns. The results are used to infer the possible roles of different species in determining the observed spatio-temporal incidence of canine distemper virus in Serengeti lions during an outbreak in 1993-94.

TI Dynamics of a multihost pathogen in a carnivore community
AB 1. We provide the first theoretical analysis of multihost disease dynamics to incorporate social behaviour and contrasting rates of within- and between-group disease transmission.
   2. A stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model of disease transmission involving one to three sympatric species was built to mimic the 1994 Serengeti canine distemper virus outbreak, which infected a variety of carnivores with widely ranging social structures. The model successfully mimicked the erratic and discontinuous spatial pattern of lion deaths observed in the Serengeti lions under a reasonable range of parameter values, but only when one to two other species repeatedly transmitted the virus to the lion population.
   3. The outputs from our model suggest several principles that will apply to most directly transmitted multihost pathogens: (i) differences in social structure can significantly influence the size, velocity and spatial pattern of a multihost epidemic; and (ii) social structures that permit higher intraspecific neighbour-to-neighbour transmission are the most likely to transmit disease to other species; whereas (iii) species with low neighbour-to-neighbour intraspecific transmission suffer the greatest costs from interspecific transmission.

TI Host ecology and life-history traits associated with blood parasite
   species richness in birds
AB Identifying host traits associated with the number of different parasite species or strains harboured by a particular host species can have important implications for understanding the impact of parasitism on hosts. We investigated associations between host ecology and life history, and parasite richness and prevalence of the four major avian blood parasite genera. We used an extensive data on blood parasite infections and host ecology in 263 bird species from the Western Palearctic, combining species-specific data with a comparative approach to control for similarity in phenotype among host species due to the effects of common phylogenetic descent. Adult survival rate negatively correlated with the number of parasite species infecting a host species when controlling for similarity due to common descent and body mass. In addition, the prevalence of Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon was higher in species harbouring a richer parasite assemblage. These results suggest that the impact on host fitness caused by avian haematozoa may be underestimated in natural populations if the exacerbated virulence associated with exposure to multiple parasites is not taken into account.

TI Maximized virulence in a sterilizing pathogen: the anther-smut fungus
   and its co-evolved hosts
AB Host sterilization is a common feature of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Because host reproductive failure may free up resources for pathogen reproduction and transmission, theory predicts that selection on sterilizing pathogens will favour maximum virulence (i.e. complete sterilization). We examined patterns of infection in sexually transmitted anther-smut fungi (Microbotryum) on four of their host species in the Caryophyllaceae. Using controlled fungal matings and experimental inoculations, we compared disease expression in inoculations ranging from host-specific pathogens to hybrids and cross-species treatments. Our data support the existence of host-specific sibling species within the genus Microbotryum based on a low infection rate from cross-inoculations and reduced fitness for hybrid pathogens. These patterns of host specificity and reproductive isolation, however, were not absolute. We did observe some successful cross-species and hybrid infections, but the expression of disease was frequently incomplete, including only partial host sterilization and the failed dehiscence of pathogen spores. The prevalence of these maladapted disease phenotypes may greatly inhibit the emergence of novel host pathogen combinations. Infections by hybrid pathogen genotypes were intermediate, in terms of both infection rate and the normality of disease symptoms, between host-specific and cross-inoculated pathogens. In addition, the frequency with which hybrid and cross-inoculated anther-smut pathogens were able to infect but not sterilize new hosts supports the prediction that sterilizing STDs are under selection to maximize virulence in natural populations.

TI Selection for cuticular melanism reveals immune function and
   life-history trade-offs in Spodoptera littoralis
AB Several insect species show an increase in cuticular melanism in response to high densities. In some species, there is evidence that this melanism is correlated with an up-regulation of certain immune system components, particularly phenoloxidase (PO) activity, and with the down-regulation of lysozyme activity, suggesting a trade-off between the two traits. As melanism has a genetic component, we selected both melanic and nonmelanic lines of the phase-polyphenic lepidopteran, Spodoptera littoralis, in order to test for a causative genetic link between melanism, PO activity and lysozyme activity, and to establish if there are any life-history costs associated with the melanic response. We found that, in fact, melanic lines had lower PO activity and higher lysozyme activity than nonmelanic lines, confirming a genetic trade-off between the two immune responses, but also indicating a genetic trade-off between melanism and PO activity. In addition, we found that lines with high PO activity had slower development rates suggesting that investment in PO, rather than in melanism, is costly.

We discuss recent experimental work in the light of simple mathematical models of coevolution to demonstrate the potential power of this phenotypic experimental approach.

TI Spontaneous viral clearance, viral load, and genotype distribution of

   antibodies in Europe
AB Background. Variables influencing serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels and genotype distribution in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are not well known, nor are factors determining spontaneous clearance after exposure to HCV in this population.
   Methods. All HCV antibody (Ab)-positive patients with HIV infection in the EuroSIDA cohort who had stored samples were tested for serum HCV RNA, and HCV genotyping was done for subjects with viremia. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with spontaneous HCV clearance and HCV genotype 1.
   Results. Of 1940 HCV Ab-positive patients, 1496 (77%) were serum HCV RNA positive. Injection drug users (IDUs) were less likely to have spontaneously cleared HCV than were homosexual men (20% vs. 39%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.36 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.24-0.53]), whereas patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were more likely to have spontaneously cleared HCV than were those negative for HBsAg (43% vs. 21%; aOR, 2.91 [95% CI, 1.94-4.38]). Of patients with HCV viremia, 786 (53%) carried HCV genotype 1, and 53 (4%), 440 (29%), and 217 (15%) carried HCV genotype 2, 3, and 4, respectively. A greater HCV RNA level was associated with a greater chance of being infected with HCV genotype 1 (aOR, 1.60 per 1 log higher [95% CI, 1.36-1.88]).
   Conclusions. More than three-quarters of the HIV- and HCV Ab -positive patients in EuroSIDA showed active HCV replication. Viremia was more frequent in IDUs and, conversely, was less common in HBsAg-positive patients. Of the patients with HCV viremia analyzed, 53% were found to carry HCV genotype 1, and this genotype was associated with greater serum HCV RNA levels.

TI Functional variation in a disease resistance gene in populations of
   Arabidopsis thaliana
AB Analyses of functional genetic diversity in natural populations may provide important new insights into gene function and are necessary to understand the evolutionary processes maintaining diversity itself. The importance of including diversity within and between local populations in such studies is often ignored although many of the processes affecting genetic diversity act on this scale. Here we examine the molecular diversity in RPW8 (Recognition of Powdery Mildew), a gene conferring broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildews in Arabidopsis thaliana stock-center accessions. Our eight UK study populations of the weedy A. thaliana were from locations judged to be subject to a minimum of anthropogenic disturbance and potentially long established. The majority of populations comprised considerable variation both in disease phenotype and RPW8 genotype. Although resistant individuals shared a major RPW8 genotype, no single allele was uniquely associated with resistance. It is concluded that RPW8 is an essential component of resistance to powdery mildews in A. thaliana, but not the only genetic factor involved in this process. No signature of selection was detected at RPW8 with a microsatellite multilocus test using an empirical null model. Unlike many previous studies of this model plant species, we found high levels of genetic diversity and relatively low differentiation (F-ST = 0.31) between populations at 14 microsatellite markers. This is judged to be due to our sampling being aimed at potentially long established populations and highlights the importance of population choice for studies of genetic diversity within this species.

TI Warmer Weather Linked to Tick Attack and Emergence of Severe
   Rickettsioses
AB The impact of climate on the vector behaviour of the worldwide dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus is a cause of concern. This tick is a vector for life-threatening organisms including Rickettsia rickettsii, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, R. conorii, the agent of Mediterranean spotted fever, and the ubiquitous emerging pathogen R. massiliae. A focus of spotted fever was investigated in France in May 2007. Blood and tissue samples from two patients were tested. An entomological survey was organised with the study of climatic conditions. An experimental model was designed to test the affinity of Rh. sanguineus for biting humans in variable temperature conditions. Serological and/or molecular tools confirmed that one patient was infected by R. conorii, whereas the other was infected by R. massiliae. Dense populations of Rh. sanguineus were found. They were infected with new genotypes of clonal populations of either R. conorii (24/133; 18%) or R. massiliae (13/133; 10%). April 2007 was the warmest since 1950, with summer-like temperatures. We show herein that the human affinity of Rh. sanguineus was increased in warmer temperatures. In addition to the originality of theses cases ( ophthalmic involvements, the second reported case of R. massiliae infection), we provide evidence that this cluster of cases was related to a warming-mediated increase in the aggressiveness of Rh. sanguineus, leading to increased human attacks. From a global perspective, we predict that as a result of globalisation and warming, more pathogens transmitted by the brown dog tick may emerge in the future.

TI Controlled Chaos of Polymorphic Mucins in a Metazoan Parasite
   (Schistosoma mansoni) Interacting with Its Invertebrate Host
   (Biomphalaria glabrata)
AB Invertebrates were long thought to possess only a simple, effective and hence non-adaptive defence system against microbial and parasitic attacks. However, recent studies have shown that invertebrate immunity also relies on immune receptors that diversify ( e. g. in echinoderms, insects and mollusks ( Biomphalaria glabrata)). Apparently, individual or population-based polymorphism-generating mechanisms exists that permit the survival of invertebrate species exposed to parasites. Consequently, the generally accepted arms race hypothesis predicts that molecular diversity and polymorphism also exist in parasites of invertebrates. We investigated the diversity and polymorphism of parasite molecules ( Schistosoma mansoni Polymorphic Mucins, SmPoMucs) that are key factors for the compatibility of schistosomes interacting with their host, the mollusc Biomphalaria glabrata. We have elucidated the complex cascade of mechanisms acting both at the genomic level and during expression that confer polymorphism to SmPoMuc. We show that SmPoMuc is coded by a multigene family whose members frequently recombine. We show that these genes are transcribed in an individual-specific manner, and that for each gene, multiple splice variants exist. Finally, we reveal the impact of this polymorphism on the SmPoMuc glycosylation status. Our data support the view that S. mansoni has evolved a complex hierarchical system that efficiently generates a high degree of polymorphism - a "controlled chaos'' - based on a relatively low number of genes. This contrasts with protozoan parasites that generate antigenic variation from large sets of genes such as Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum. Our data support the view that the interaction between parasites and their invertebrate hosts are far more complex than previously thought. While most studies in this matter have focused on invertebrate host diversification, we clearly show that diversifying mechanisms also exist on the parasite side of the interaction. Our findings shed new light on how and why invertebrate immunity develops.

TI Population Genetics of Schistosoma japonicum within the Philippines
   Suggest High Levels of Transmission between Humans and Dogs
AB Background: Schistosoma japonicum, which remains a major public health problem in the Philippines and mainland China, is the only schistosome species for which zoonotic transmission is considered important. While bovines are suspected as the main zoonotic reservoir in parts of China, the relative contributions of various non-human mammals to S. japonicum transmission in the Philippines remain to be determined. We examined the population genetics of S. japonicum in the Philippines in order to elucidate transmission patterns across host species and geographic areas.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: S. japonicum miracidia ( hatched from eggs within fecal samples) from humans, dogs, pigs and rats, and cercariae shed from snail-intermediate hosts, were collected across two geographic areas of Samar Province. Individual isolates were then genotyped using seven multiplexed microsatellite loci. Wright's F(ST) values and phylogenetic trees calculated for parasite populations suggest a high frequency of parasite gene-flow across definitive host species, particularly between dogs and humans. Parasite genetic differentiation between areas was not evident at the definitive host level, possibly suggesting frequent import and export of infections between villages, although there was some evidence of geographic structuring at the snail-intermediate host level.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest very high levels of transmission across host species, and indicate that the role of dogs should be considered when planning control programs. Furthermore, a regional approach to treatment programs is recommended where human migration is extensive.

TI Exploration of the Effectiveness of Social Distancing on Respiratory
   Pathogen Transmission Implicates Environmental Contributions
AB Background. In both military and civilian settings, transmission of respiratory pathogens may be due to person-to-person and environmental contributions. This possibility was explored in a military training setting, where rates of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) often reach epidemic levels.
   Methods. Population size and FRI rates were monitored over 10 months in the units of 50-90 individuals. Some units were open to the influx of potentially infectious convalescents (hereafter referred to as "open units," and some were closed to such an influx (hereafter referred to as "closed units"). Virologic testing and polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to detect adenovirus on surface structures.
   Results. The odds ratio (OR) associated with FRI in closed units, compared with open units, was 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.28). The OR in units with a population greater than the median size, compared with units with a population lower than the median size was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.23-1.55). Between 5% and 9% of surface samples obtained from selected units harbored viable adenovirus.
   Conclusions. FRI rates were not reduced in units that were closed to potentially contagious individuals. These findings imply that the primary source of the pathogen is likely environmental rather than human, and they underscore what is known about other virus types. Diligence in identifying the relative roles of different transmission routes is suggested for civilian settings similar to those described in the current study.

AB Background. A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine that limits disease and transmission is urgently needed. This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV vaccine that combines a plasmid-DNA priming vaccine and a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) boosting vaccine. Methods. Forty healthy volunteers were injected with DNA plasmids containing gp160 of HIV-1 subtypes A, B, and C; rev B; p17/p24 gag A and B, and RTmut B by use of a needle-free injection system. The vaccine was administered intradermally or intramuscularly, with or without recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and boosted with a heterologousMVAcontaining env, gag, and pol of CRF01A_ E. Immune responses were monitored with HIV-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2 ELISpot and lymphoproliferative assays (LPAs). Results. Vaccine-related adverse events were mild and tolerable. After receipt of the DNA priming vaccine, 11 (30%) of 37 vaccinees had HIV-specific IFN-gamma responses. After receipt of the MVA boosting vaccine, ELISpot assays showed that 34 (92%) of 37 vaccinees had HIV-specific IFN-gamma responses, 32 (86%) to Gag and 24 ( 65%) to Env. IFN-gamma production was detected in both the CD8(+) T cell compartment ( 5 of 9 selected vaccinees) and the CD4(+) T cell compartment ( 9 of 9). ELISpot results showed that 25 ( 68%) of 37 vaccinees had a positive IL-2 response and 35 ( 92%) of 38 had a positive LPA response. Of 38 subjects, a total of 37 (97%) were responders. One milligram of HIV-1 DNA administered intradermally was as effective as 4mg administered intramuscularly in priming for the MVA boosting vaccine. Conclusion. This HIV-DNA priming-MVA boosting approach is safe and highly immunogenic.

TI Murine Model to Study the Invasion and Survival of Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis in the Central Nervous System
AB Background. Tuberculosis of the central nervous system (CNS) is a serious, often fatal disease primarily affecting young children. It develops after hematogenous dissemination and subsequent invasion of the CNS by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The microbial determinants involved in CNS disease are poorly characterized.
   Methods. Hematogenously disseminated M. tuberculosis infection was simulated in BALB/c mice by intravenous challenge. Bacteria were recovered using standard culture techniques. Host immune response to M. tuberculosis infection was assessed by histopathological and cytokine profile analysis. By means of a pooled infection with genotypically defined M. tuberculosis mutants, bacterial genes required for invasion or survival were determined in the CNS and lung tissue.
   Results. M. tuberculosis were detected in whole mouse brains as early as 1 day after intravenous infection and at all time points assessed thereafter. No significant immune response was elicited in the infected brain tissue, compared with extensive inflammation in the infected lung tissue at the same time point. We identified mutants for 5 M. tuberculosis genes (Rv0311, Rv0805, Rv0931c, Rv0986, and MT3280) with CNS-specific phenotypes, absent in lung tissue.
   Conclusions. We have identified CNS-specific M. tuberculosis genes involved in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Further characterization of these genes will help in understanding the microbial pathogenesis of CNS tuberculosis.

TI Premature Apoptosis of Chlamydia-Infected Cells Disrupts Chlamydial
   Development
AB The obligate intracellular development of Chlamydia suggests that the bacteria should be vulnerable to premature host cell apoptosis, but because Chlamydia-infected cells are apoptosis resistant, this has never been able to be tested. We have devised a system to circumvent the apoptotic block imposed by chlamydial infection. When the proapoptotic protein Bim(S) was experimentally induced, epithelial cells underwent apoptosis that was not blocked by chlamydial infection. Apoptosis during the developmental cycle prevented the generation of infectious bacteria and caused transcriptional changes of bacterial genes and loss of intracellular ATP. Intriguingly, although apoptosis resulted in destruction of host cell structures and of the Chlamydia inclusion, and prevented generation of elementary bodies, BimS induction in the presence of a caspase inhibitor allowed differentiation into morphologically normal but noninfectious elementary bodies. These data show that chlamydial infection renders host cells apoptosis resistant at a premitochondrial step and demonstrate the consequences of premature apoptosis for development of the bacteria.

The C57BL/6 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA showed typical symptoms of ECM. Interestingly, preceding H. polygyrus infection did not alter ECM development, despite accelerated P. berghei growth in vivo. Our observation provides a new insight that ECM can be induced in a fashion independent of the immune responses affected by concurrent H. polygyrus. Differentiation between protective immunity and infection-associated host-damaging inflammatory response is urgently required for understanding the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria.

TI Hybrid Fitness in a Locally Adapted Parasite
AB The parasite (Red Queen) hypothesis for the maintenance of sexual reproduction and genetic diversity assumes that host-parasite interactions result from tight genetic specificity. Hence, hybridization between divergent parasite populations would be expected to disrupt adaptive gene combinations, leading to reduced infectivity on exposure to parental sympatric hosts, as long as gene effects are nonadditive. In contrast, hybridization would not cause reduced infectivity on allopatric hosts unless the divergent parasite populations possess alleles that are intrinsically incompatible when they are combined. In three different experiments, we compared the infectivity of locally adapted parasite (trematode) populations with that of F 1 hybrid parasites when exposed to host (snail) populations that were sympatric to one of the two parasite populations. We tested for intrinsic genetic incompatibilities in two experiments by including one host population that was allopatric to both parasite populations. As predicted, when the target host populations were sympatric to the parasite populations, the hybrids were significantly less infective than the parental average, while hybrid parasites on allopatric hosts were not, thereby ruling out intrinsic genetic incompatibilities. The results are consistent with nonadditive gene effects and tightly specific host-driven selection underlying parasite divergence, as envisioned by coevolutionary theory and the Red Queen hypothesis.

TI Allometric Scaling and Seasonality in the Epidemics of Wildlife Diseases
AB We present a susceptibles-exposed-infectives (SEI) model to analyze the effects of seasonality on epidemics, mainly of rabies, in a wide range of wildlife species. Model parameters are cast as simple allometric functions of host body size. Via nonlinear analysis, we investigate the dynamical behavior of the disease for different levels of seasonality in the transmission rate and for different values of the pathogen basic reproduction number (R-0) over a broad range of body sizes. While the unforced SEI model exhibits long-term epizootic cycles only for large values of R-0, the seasonal model exhibits multiyear periodicity for small values of R-0. The oscillation period predicted by the seasonal model is consistent with those observed in the field for different host species. These conclusions are not affected by alternative assumptions for the shape of seasonality or for the parameters that exhibit seasonal variations. However, the introduction of host immunity (which occurs for rabies in some species and is typical of many other wildlife diseases) significantly modifies the epidemic dynamics; in this case, multiyear cycling requires a large level of seasonal forcing. Our analysis suggests that the explicit inclusion of periodic forcing in models of wildlife disease may be crucial to correctly describe the epidemics of wildlife that live in strongly seasonal environments.

TI Host-Pathogen Interactions, Insect Outbreaks, and Natural Selection for
   Disease Resistance
AB The theory of insect population dynamics has shown that heterogeneity in natural-enemy attack rates is strongly stabilizing. We tested the usefulness of this theory for outbreaking insects, many of which are attacked by infectious pathogens. We measured heterogeneity among gypsy moth larvae in their risk of infection with a nucleopolyhedrovirus, which is effectively heterogeneity in the pathogen's attack rate. Our data show that heterogeneity in infection risk in this insect is so high that it leads to a stable equilibrium in the models, which is inconsistent with the outbreaks seen in North American gypsy moth populations. Our data further suggest that infection risk declines after epidemics, in turn suggesting that the model assumption of constant infection risk is incorrect. We therefore constructed an alternative model in which natural selection drives fluctuations in infection risk, leading to reductions after epidemics because of selection for resistance and increases after epidemics because of a cost of resistance. This model shows cycles even for high heterogeneity, and experiments confirm that infection risk is indeed heritable. The model is very general, and so we argue that natural selection for disease resistance may play a role in many insect outbreaks.

TI The Role of Heterogeneity in the Persistence and Prevalence of Sin
   Nombre Virus in Deer Mice
AB Many diseases persist at a relatively low prevalence, seemingly close to extinction. For a chronic disease in a homogeneous population, reducing the transmission rate by a fraction proportional to the prevalence would be sufficient to eradicate the disease. This study examines how higher prevalence of the Sin Nombre virus in male deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) might contribute to disease persistence. Analyzing data from over 2,000 individual mice captured in 19 sites over 4 years, we found prevalences of 18.5% in males and 8.8% in females. By examining recaptures, we determined that males are more likely to contract the infection because of higher susceptibility or higher encounter rates. Comparing across 86 sampling periods, we found a higher proportion of males when population densities were low. A capture-recapture analysis indicates that males live longer than females. A mathematical model based on the measured parameters and population size trajectories suggests that the combined heterogeneity in encounters, susceptibility, and mortality may buffer the disease from extinction by concentrating disease in the subgroup most likely to transmit the disease. This buffering effect is not significantly stronger in a fluctuating population, indicating that these forms of heterogeneity might not be the key for disease persistence through host population bottlenecks.

TI Acute or Chronic? Within-Host Models with Immune Dynamics, Infection
   Outcome, and Parasite Evolution
AB There is ample theoretical and experimental evidence that virulence evolution depends on the immune response of the host. In this article, we review a number of recent studies that attempt to explicitly incorporate the dynamics of the immune system (instead of merely representing it by a single black box parameter) in models for the evolution of parasite virulence. A striking observation is that the type of infection (acute or chronic) is invariably considered to be a constraint that model assumptions have to satisfy rather than as a potential outcome of the interaction of the parasite with its host's immune system. We argue that avoiding making assumptions about the type of infection will lead to a better understanding of infectious diseases, even though a number of fundamental and technical problems remain. Dynamical modeling of the immune system opens a wide range of perspectives: for understanding how the immune system eradicates a parasite (which it does for most pathogens but not for all, HIV being a notorious example of a virus that is not completely eliminated), for studying multiple infections through concomitant immunity, for understanding the emergence and evolution of the immune system in animals, and for evolutionary epidemiology in general (e. g., predicting evolutionary consequences of new therapies and public health policies). We conclude by discussing new approaches based on embedded (or nested) models and identify future perspectives for the modeling of infectious diseases.

TI Gastrointestinal Bacterial Transmission among Humans, Mountain Gorillas,
   and Livestock in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda
AB Habitat overlap can increase the risks of anthroponotic and zoonotic pathogen transmission between humans, livestock, and wild apes. We collected Escherichia coli bacteria from humans, livestock, and mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, from May to August 2005 to examine whether habitat overlap influences rates and patterns of pathogen transmission between humans and apes and whether livestock might facilitate transmission. We genotyped 496 E. coli isolates with repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting and measured susceptibility to 11 antibiotics with the disc-diffusion method. We conducted population genetic analyses to examine genetic differences among populations of bacteria from different hosts and locations. Gorilla populations that overlapped in their use of habitat at high rates with people and livestock harbored E. coli that were genetically similar to E. coli from those people and livestock, whereas E. coli from gorillas that did not overlap in their use of habitats with people and livestock were more distantly related to human or livestock bacteria. Thirty-five percent of isolates from humans, 27% of isolates from livestock, and 17% of isolates from gorillas were clinically resistant to at least one antibiotic used by local people, and the proportion of individual gorillas harboring resistant isolates declined across populations in proportion to decreasing degrees of habitat overlap with humans. These patterns of genetic similarity and antibiotic resistance among E. coli from populations of apes, humans, and livestock indicate that habitat overlap between species affects the dynamics of gastrointestinal bacterial transmission, perhaps through domestic animal intermediates and the physical environment. Limiting such transmission would benefit human and domestic animal health and ape conservation.

TI Designing Graduate Training Programs in Conservation Medicine-Producing

AB New challenges to human, animal, and ecosystem health demand novel solutions: New diseases are emerging from new configurations of humans, their domestic animals and wildlife; new pressures on once robust and resilient ecosystems are compromising their integrity; synthetic compounds and engineered organisms, new to the natural world, are spreading unpredictably around the globe. Globalization provides opportunities for infectious organisms to gain access to new hosts, changing in distribution and virulence. What type of training should be developed to provide professionals with the right tools to meet these challenges? In this article, we offer recommendations for developing academic programs in conservation medicine. We discuss the need for, and the advantages to, using a conservation medicine approach to address real world situations and present illustrations of how this is applied today. We suggest a core set of skills that are needed in a conservation medicine practitioner, and recommend key considerations for designing new conservation medicine training programs. We review existing programs that offer conservation medicine content, and provide examples of where opportunities exist for those interested in pursuing a conservation medicine career.

TI METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS OVERRIDE LOCAL LIMITS ON LONG-TERM PARASITE
   PERSISTENCE
AB A simple null model, particularly germane to small and vulnerable organisms such as parasites, is that local conditions set a stage upon which larger-scale dynamics play out. Soil moisture strongly influences survival of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), which in turn drive trophic cascades by protecting vegetation from root-feeding herbivores. In this study, we examine the mechanisms responsible for patchy occurrence of an entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis marelatus, in a California coastal prairie. One hypothesis proposes that biotic factors such as competition and natural enemies could regulate occurrence of EPN populations. We found that fungi and other enemies of EPN, although locally potent, did not explain the patterns of incidence across sites. Abiotic factors also have strong effects on EPN persistence, especially for vulnerable free-living stages. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that patchy occurrence of EPN on a large landscape was driven by differences in soil moisture.
   Our research uses long-term data on nematode incidence in combination with a landscape-level experiment to demonstrate the lack of a correlation between soil moisture and long-term persistence. A year-long experiment showed EPN mortality was weakly correlated with soil moisture among our study sites. Thirteen years of data, however, showed that colonization rates were highly correlated with long-term persistence. Sites with highest long-term persistence experienced the highest rates of rhizosphere colonization, extinction, and turnover. As a result, we concluded that metapopulation dynamics override limitations set by local and short-term abiotic conditions to determine long-term persistence in this parasite-driven trophic cascade.

TI Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (H5N1) Infection in Red Foxes
   Fed Infected Bird Carcasses
AB Eating infected wild birds may put wild carnivores at high risk for infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (H5N1). To determine whether red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are susceptible to infection with HPAI virus (H5N1), we infected 3 foxes intratracheally. They excreted virus pharyngeally for 3-7 days at peak titers of 10(3.5)-10(5.2) median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per mL and had severe pneumonia, myocarclitis, and encephalitis. To determine whether foxes can become infected by the presumed natural route, we fed infected bird carcasses to 3 other red foxes. These foxes excreted virus pharyngeally for 3-5 days at peak titers of 10(4.2)-10(4.5) TCID50/mL, but only mild or no pneumonia developed. This study demonstrates that red foxes fed bird carcasses infected with HPAI virus (H5N1) can excrete virus while remaining free of severe disease, thereby potentially playing a role in virus dispersal.

TI Enzootic Rabies Elimination from Dogs and Reemergence in Wild
   Terrestrial Carnivores, United States
AB To provide molecular and virologic evidence that domestic dog rabies is no longer enzootic to the United States and to identify putative relatives of dog-related rabies viruses (RVs) circulating in other carnivores, we studied RVs associated with recent and historic dog rabies enzootics worldwide. Molecular, phylogenetic, and epizootiologic evidence shows that domestic dog rabies is no longer enzootic to the United States. Nonetheless, our data suggest that independent rabies enzootics are now established in wild terrestrial carnivores (skunks in California and north-central United States, gray foxes in Texas and Arizona, and mongooses in Puerto Rico), as a consequence of different spillover events from long-term rabies enzootics associated with dogs. These preliminary results highlight the key role of dog RVs and human-dog demographics as operative factors for host shifts and disease reemergence into other important carnivore populations and highlight the need for the elimination of dog-related RVs worldwide.

TI Climate Variability, Social and Environmental Factors, and Ross River
   Virus Transmission: Research Development and Future Research Needs
AB BACKGROUND: Arbovirus diseases have emerged as a global public health concern. However, the impact of climatic, social, and environmental variability on the transmission of arbovirus diseases remains to be determined.
   OBJECTIVE: Our goal for this study was to provide an overview of research development and future research directions about the interrelationship between climate variability, social and environmental factors, and the transmission of Ross River virus (RRV), the most common and widespread arbovirus disease in Australia.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search on climatic, social, and environmental factors and RRV disease. Potentially relevant studies were identified from a series of electronic searches.
   RESULTS: The body of evidence revealed that the transmission cycles of RRV disease appear to be sensitive to climate and tidal variability. Rainfall, temperature, and high tides were among major determinants of the transmission of RRV disease at the macro level. However, the nature and magnitude of the interrelationship between climate variability, mosquito density, and the transmission of RRV disease varied with geographic area and socioenvironmental condition. Projected anthropogenic global climatic change may result in an increase in RRV infections, and the key determinants of RRV transmission we have identified here may be useful in the development of an early warning system.
   CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that there is a complex relationship between climate variability, social and environmental factors, and RRV transmission. Different strategies may be needed for the control and prevention of RRV disease at different levels. These research findings could be used as an additional tool to support decision making in disease control/surveillance and risk management.

TI The transmission and control of XDR TB in South Africa: an operations
   research and mathematical modelling approach
AB Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) has emerged as a threat to TB control efforts in several high-burden areas, generating international concern. XDR TB is now found in every region of the world, but appears most worrisome in the context of HIV and in resource-limited settings with congregate hospital wards. Here, we examine the emergence and transmission dynamics of the disease, incorporating the mathematical modelling literature related to airborne infection and epidemiological studies related to the operations of TB control programmes in resource-limited settings. We find that while XDR TB may present many challenges in the setting, of resource constraints, the central problems highlighted by the emergence of XDR TB are those that have plagued TB programmes for years. These Include a slow rate of case detection that permits prolonged infectiousness, the threat of airborne infection in enclosed spaces. the problem of inadequate treatment delivery and treatment completion, and the need to develop health systems that can address the combination of TB and poverty. Mathematical models of TB transmission shed light on the idea that community-based therapy and rapid detection systems may be beneficial in resource-limited settings, while congregate hospital wards are sites for major structural reform.

TI GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN ADAPTATION AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL: A CASE STUDY
   OF PLANT IMMUNITY GENES
AB Natural selection imposed by interacting species frequently varies among geographic locations and can lead to local adaptation, where alternative phenotypes are found in different populations. Little is known, however, about whether geographically variable selection acting on traits that mediate species interactions is consistent or strong enough to influence patterns of nucleotide variation at individual loci. To investigate this question, we examined patterns of nucleotide diversity and population structure at 16 plant innate immunity genes, with putative functions in defending plants against pathogens or herbivores, from six populations of teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis). Specifically, we tested whether patterns of population structure and within-population diversity at immunity genes differed from patterns found at nonimmunity (reference) loci and from neutral expectations derived from coalescent simulations of structured populations. For the majority of genes, we detected no strong evidence of geographically variable selection. However, in the wound-induced serine protease inhibitor (wip1), which inhibits the hydrolysis of dietary proteins in insect herbivores, one population showed unusually high levels of genetic differentiation, very low levels of nucleotide polymorphism, and was fixed for a novel replacement substitution in the active site of the protein. Taken together, these data suggest that wip1 experienced a recent selective sweep in one geographic region; this pattern may reflect local adaptation or an ongoing species-wide sweep. Overall, our results indicate that a signature of local adaptation at the molecular level may be uncommon-particularly for traits that are under complex genetic control.

TI EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY ON VICTIM-EXPLOITER COEVOLUTION
AB We study victim-exploiter coevolution in a spatially heterogeneous island model. In each species, fitness consequences of between-species interactions are controlled by a single haploid diallelic locus. Our emphasis is on the conditions for the maintenance of genetic variation, the dynamic patterns observed, the extent of local adaptation and genetic differentiation between different demes, and on how different parameters (such as the strength and heterogeneity in selection, migration rates, and the number of sites) affect the dynamic and static behavior of the system. We show that under spatially homogeneous selection the maintenance of genetic variation is possible through asynchronous nonlinear dynamics where the allele frequencies in a majority of demes quickly synchronize but the rest do not. Spatially heterogeneous selection can maintain genetic variation even if migration rates are maximal. This happens in an oscillatory way. Genetic variation is most likely to be maintained at high levels if the heterogeneity in selection is large. If there are some restrictions on migration, genetic variation can be maintained at a stable equilibrium. This behavior is most likely at intermediate migration rates. In this case, the system can exhibit high spatial subdivision as measured by F(ST) values but relatively low local adaptation.

TI Evaluating evidence of association of bovine tuberculosis in cattle and
   badgers
AB 1. Bovine tuberculosis (TB) occurs in cattle and badgers in the UK and control efforts are undertaken to reduce the spread of the disease.
   2. This study evaluates relationships predicted by nine epidemiological two-host models of disease spread generated by various combinations of density-dependent, frequency-dependent and environmental pathogen transmission. The relationships of interest are between measures of TB in cattle and in badgers from 10 sites which were randomly selected to be proactive badger culling sites in the UK Randomized Badger Culling Trial. The data are from the initial badger cull only.
   3. There was most support (Akaike weight = 0.562, R-2 = 0.869) for models that predicted a positive linear relationship between density of infectious cattle per square kilometre and the density index of infectious badgers. There was less support (Akaike weight = 0.060) for a model that predicted a positive linear relationship between density of infectious cattle per square kilometre and the proportion of badgers infectious with Mycobacterium bovis. A correction to reduce effects of badger carcase storage and an examination of effects of the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic had little impact on estimated relationships.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The results provide support for two-host disease models of TB in cattle and wildlife such as badgers, although the form of disease transmission cannot be identified clearly by these analyses. The implication of the results is that the best-fitting models predict that, in the absence of intervention-related changes in badger behaviour, a reduction in density of infectious badgers should reduce the density of infectious cattle. However, analysis of bait-marking data collected following experimental badger culls indicated that culling badgers profoundly alters their spatial organization as well as their population density, potentially influencing contact rates. Effective vaccination of badgers, were it to become available, would be expected to reduce the density of infectious badgers without directly affecting their behaviour.

TI Comparative phylogeography of two seastars and their ectosymbionts
   within the Coral Triangle
AB Repeated exposure and flooding of the Sunda and Sahul shelves during Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations is thought to have contributed to the isolation and diversification of sea-basin populations within the Coral Triangle. This hypothesis has been tested in numerous phylogeographical studies, recovering an assortment of genetic patterns that the authors have generally attributed to differences in larval dispersal capability or adult habitat specificity. This study compares phylogeographical patterns from mitochondrial COI sequences among two co-distributed seastars that differ in their adult habitat and dispersal ability, and two seastar ectosymbionts that differ in their degree of host specificity. Of these, only the seastar Linckia laevigata displayed a classical pattern of Indian-Pacific divergence, but with only moderate genetic structure (Phi(CT) = 0.067). In contrast, the seastar Protoreaster nodosus exhibited strong structure (Phi(CT) = 0.23) between Teluk Cenderawasih and the remainder of Indonesia, a pattern of regional structure that was echoed in L. laevigata (Phi(CT) = 0.03) as well as its obligate gastropod parasite Thyca crystallina (Phi(CT) = 0.04). The generalist commensal shrimp, Periclimenes soror showed little genetic structuring across the Coral Triangle. Despite species-specific phylogeographical patterns, all four species showed departures from neutrality that are consistent with massive range expansions onto the continental shelves as the sea levels rose, and that date within the Pleistocene epoch. Our results suggest that habitat differences may affect the manner in which species responded to Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, shaping contemporary patterns of genetic structure and diversity.

TI Dynamic Correlation between Intrahost HIV-1 Quasispecies Evolution and
   Disease Progression
AB Quantifying the dynamics of intrahost HIV-1 sequence evolution is one means of uncovering information about the interaction between HIV-1 and the host immune system. In the chronic phase of infection, common dynamics of sequence divergence and diversity have been reported. We developed an HIV-1 sequence evolution model that simulated the effects of mutation and fitness of sequence variants. The amount of evolution was described by the distance from the founder strain, and fitness was described by the number of offspring a parent sequence produces. Analysis of the model suggested that the previously observed saturation of divergence and decrease of diversity in later stages of infection can be explained by a decrease in the proportion of offspring that are mutants as the distance from the founder strain increases rather than due to an increase of viral fitness. The prediction of the model was examined by performing phylogenetic analysis to estimate the change in the rate of evolution during infection. In agreement with our modeling, in 13 out of 15 patients (followed for 3-12 years) we found that the rate of intrahost HIV-1 evolution was not constant but rather slowed down at a rate correlated with the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline. The correlation between the dynamics of the evolutionary rate and the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline, coupled with our HIV-1 sequence evolution model, explains previously conflicting observations of the relationships between the rate of HIV-1 quasispecies evolution and disease progression.

TI Vector Competence of Australian Mosquito Species for a North American
   Strain of West Nile Virus
AB Since the establishment of West Nile virus (WNV) into the United States, concern has arisen that this virus may also pose a serious threat to Australian biosecurity. The vector competence of 19 Australian mosquito species for a North American strain of WNV was evaluated. Mosquitoes collected from Cairns, Brisbane, and Sydney were exposed to blood containing 10(4.0 +/- 0.3) cell culture infectious dose(50)/mosquito WNV that was isolated from a crow during the 1999 New York outbreak. Mosquitoes were tested 12-15 days later to determine their infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. A number of Culex spp. demonstrated a high vector competence for this virus, with some populations of Culex annulirostris, the primary Australian Kunjin virus vector, displaying transmission rates up to 84%. Similarly, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. gelidus were highly competent, with infection and transmission rates of > 80% and > 50%, respectively. Common Aedes spp., including Aedes notoscriptus, Ae. vigilax, and Ae. procax, were moderately susceptible, and some Verrallina spp. and Coquillettidia spp. were relatively refractory to infection. Thus, Australia possesses a number of competent mosquito species that could facilitate local transmission of WNV, should it be introduced.

TI Density-Dependent Competitive Suppression of Sylvatic Dengue Virus by
   Endemic Dengue Virus in Cultured Mosquito Cells
AB Mosquito-borne dengue viruses are maintained in two discrete transmission cycles: a sylvatic cycle between nonhuman primates and sylvatic Aedes mosquitoes, and an endemic cycle between humans and peridomestic Aedes (primarily Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus). Most sylvatic strains are genetically distinct from endemic strains, and human infections with sylvatic strains have been detected only rarely. Interestingly, sylvatic strains replicate as well as endemic strait-is in Ae. aegypti and experimental models of replication in humans, suggesting that adaptive constraints may not explain the limited spillover of sylvatic strains into the endemic cycle. Within-host competition is another mechanism known to decrease emergence of strains into occupied niches. In the current study, we examined the magnitude of competitive suppression between sylvatic and endemic dengue strains of different serotypes in pair-wise mixed infections of cultured Ae. albopictus cells to test whether the ecotype or the initial ratio of the two strains influenced the outcome of competition. Strains isolated from nonhuman primates were competitively inferior to those isolated from humans. Moreover, competition was density-dependent; the magnitude of suppression increased as the starting density of a strain relative to its competitor decreased. These data Suggest that competitive inferiority in endemic vectors coupled with a numerical disadvantage relative to resident endemic strains could restrict reemergence of sylvatic strains into the endemic cycle and contribute to the ecologically correlated genetic divergence between sylvatic and endemic strains.

TI Estimating Influenza Vaccine Efficacy From Challenge and Community-based
   Study Data
AB In this paper, the authors provide estimates of 4 measures of vaccine efficacy for live, attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccine based on secondary analysis of 5 experimental influenza challenge studies in seronegative adults and community-based vaccine trials. The 4 vaccine efficacy measures are for susceptibility (VES), symptomatic illness given infection (VEP), infection and illness (VESP), and infectiousness (VEI). The authors also propose a combined (VEC) measure of the reduction in transmission in the entire population based on all of the above efficacy measures. Live influenza vaccine and inactivated vaccine provided similar protection against laboratory-confirmed infection (for live vaccine: VES = 41%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 15, 66; for inactivated vaccine: VES = 43%, 95% CI: 8, 79). Live vaccine had a higher efficacy for illness given infection (VEP = 67%, 95% CI: 24, 100) than inactivated vaccine (VEP = 29%, 95% CI: -19, 76), although the difference was not statistically significant. VESP for the live vaccine was higher than for the inactivated vaccine. VEI estimates were particularly low for these influenza vaccines. VESP and VEC can remain high for both vaccines, even when VEI is relatively low, as long as the other 2 measures of vaccine efficacy are relatively high.

TI A Killer-Rescue system for self-limiting gene drive of anti-pathogen
   constructs
AB A number of genetic mechanisms have been suggested for driving anti-pathogen genes into natural populations. Each of these mechanisms requires complex genetic engineering, and most are theoretically expected to permanently spread throughout the target species' geographical range. In the near term, risk issues and technical limits of molecular methods could delay the development and use of these mechanisms. We propose a gene-drive mechanism that can be self-limiting over time and space, and is simpler to build. This mechanism involves one gene that codes for toxicity (killer) and a second that confers immunity to the toxic effects (rescue). We use population-genetic models to explore cases with one or two independent insertions of the killer gene and one insertion of the rescue gene. We vary the dominance and penetrance of gene action, as well as the magnitude of fitness costs. Even with the fitness costs of 10 per cent for each gene, the proportion of mosquitoes expected to transmit the pathogen decreases below 5 per cent for over 40 generations after one 2 : 1 release (engineered : wild) or after four 1 : 2 releases. Both the killer and rescue genes will be lost from the population over time, if the rescue construct has any associated fitness cost. Molecular approaches for constructing strains are discussed.

TI The Allee Effect and Infectious Diseases: Extinction, Multistability,
   and the (Dis-)Appearance of Oscillations
AB Infectious diseases that affect their host on a long time-scale can regulate the host population dynamics. Here we show that a strong Allee effect can lead to complex dynamics in simple epidemic models. Generally, the Allee effect renders a population bistable, but we also identify conditions for tri- or monostability. Moreover, the disease can destabilize endemic equilibria and induce sustained oscillations. These disappear again for high transmissibilities, with eventually vanishing host population. Disease-induced extinction is thus possible for density-dependent transmission and without any alternative reservoirs. The overall complexity suggests that the system is very sensitive to perturbations and control methods, even in parameter regions with a basic reproductive ratio far beyond. R(0) = 1. This may have profound implications for biological conservation as well as pest management. We identify important threshold quantities and attribute the dynamical behavior to the joint interplay of a strong Allee effect and infection.

TI Long-term disease dynamics in lakes: causes and consequences of chytrid
   infections in Daphnia populations
AB Understanding the drivers and consequences of disease epidemics is an important frontier in ecology. However, long-term data on hosts, their parasites, and the corresponding environmental conditions necessary to explore these interactions are often unavailable. We examined the dynamics of Daphnia pulicaria, a keystone zooplankter in lake ecosystems, to explore the long-term causes and consequences of infection by a chytridiomycete parasitoid (Polycaryum laeve). After quantifying host-pathogen dynamics from vouchered samples collected over 15 years, we used autoregressive models to evaluate (1) hypothesized drivers of infection, including host density, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, host-food availability, and lake mixing; and (2) the effects of epidemics on host populations. Infection was present in most years but varied widely in prevalence, from,1% to 34%, with seasonal peaks in early spring and late fall. Within years, lake strati. cation strongly inhibited P. laeve transmission, such that epidemics occurred primarily during periods of water mixing. Development of the thermocline likely reduced transmission by spatially separating susceptible hosts from infectious zoospores. Among years, ice duration and cumulative snowfall correlated negatively with infection prevalence, likely because of reductions in spring phytoplankton and D. pulicaria density in years with extended winters. Epidemics also influenced dynamics of the host population. Infected D. pulicaria rarely (< 1%) contained eggs, and P. laeve prevalence was positively correlated with sexual reproduction in D. pulicaria. Analyses of D. pulicaria density-dependent population dynamics predicted that, in the absence of P. laeve infection, host abundance would be 11-50% higher than what was observed. By underscoring the importance of complex physical processes in controlling host-parasite interactions and of epidemic disease in influencing host populations, our results highlight the value of long-term data for understanding wildlife disease dynamics.

However, transmission of JE is likely to increase in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, North Korea, and Pakistan because of population growth, intensified rice farming, pig rearing, and the lack of vaccination programs and surveillance. On a global scale, however, the incidence of JE may decline as a result of large-scale vaccination programs implemented in China and India.

Using mathematical modeling, we estimated the risk for dengue-infected blood transfusions in Singapore in 2005 to be 1.625-6/10,000 blood transfusions, assuming a ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections of 2:1 to 10:1. However, the level of viremia required to cause clinical dengue cases is person-dependent and unknown. Further studies are needed to establish the magnitude of the threat that dengue poses to blood safety in countries where it is endemic. It will then be possible to assess whether screening is feasible and to identify approaches that are most cost-effective on the basis of characteristics of local populations and seasonality of dengue.

TI Isolation compliance among university students during a mumps outbreak,
   Kansas 2006
AB A large mumps outbreak occurred among students at a Kansas university in 2006. To reduce transmission, students with mumps were asked to isolate themselves. We describe isolation measures and student compliance with these measures. Questionnaires were administered to students suspected of having mumps. Of the 132 students instructed to stay isolated, 75% stayed isolated for the number of days recommended and were considered compliant. Case-students told to stay isolated for 1-4 days were more likely to be compliant [86% vs. 66%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3-6, 95% CI 1.4-9.0] than those told to stay isolated for 5-9 days. Those who rated avoiding contact with others during isolation as very important were also more likely to be compliant (83% vs. 60% ; aOR 3-6, 95 % CI 1.5-8.4) than those who rated the importance lower. In a college setting, it may be difficult to achieve high compliance with guidelines recommending that persons stay isolated for much longer than 4 days.

TI Contact patterns and their implied basic reproductive numbers: an
   illustration for varicella-zoster virus
AB The WAIFW matrix (Who Acquires Infection From Whom) is a central parameter in modelling the spread of infectious diseases. The calculation of the basic reproductive number (R-0) depends on the assumptions made about the transmission within and between age groups through the structure of the WAIFW matrix and different structures might lead to different estimates for R-0 and hence different estimates for the minimal immunization coverage needed for the elimination of the infection in the population. In this paper, we estimate R-0 for varicella in Belgium. The force of infection is estimated from seroprevalence data using fractional polynomials and we show how the estimate of R-0 is heavily influenced by the structure of the WAIFW matrix.

TI Transmission and quantification of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia
   coli O157 in dairy cattle and calves
AB Data from a field study of 14 months duration in a naturally colonized dairy herd and data from an experiment with calves were used to quantify transmission of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC O157) in cattle. For the latter, two groups of 10 calves were randomly assigned and put out in one of two pastures. From each group, five animals were experimentally inoculated with 10(9) c.f.u. O157 VTEC and, considered infectious, put back in their group. Each of the susceptible contact calves became positive within 6 days of being reunited. The estimate of the basic reproduction ratio (R-0) in the experiment was 7-3 (95 % CI 3.92-11.5), indicating that each infectious calf will infect seven other calves on average during an assumed infectious period of 28 days in a fully Susceptible population. The R-0 among dairy cows appeared to be about 10 times lower (0.70, 95% CI 0.48-1.04). After the transmission experiment, six contact-infected animals that were shedding continuously during the experiment were housed in a tie stall during winter. After 40 days, all six tested negative for O157 VTEC. In June, after a period of 34 weeks in which the heifers remained negative, they were put out in a clean and isolated pasture to observe whether they started shedding again. On each pasture that was infected with O157 VTEC during the transmission experiment the previous summer, newly purchased susceptible calves were placed. None of the heifers or calves started shedding during 14 weeks, indicating that both the heifers and the previously contaminated pasture did not function as reservoir of O157 VTEC.

TI MODES OF ACQUISITION OF WOLBACHIA: HORIZONTAL TRANSFER, HYBRID
   INTROGRESSION, AND CODIVERGENCE IN THE NASONIA SPECIES COMPLEX
AB Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria that infect a large number of insects and are responsible for different reproductive alterations of their hosts. One of the key features of Wolbachia biology is its ability to move within and between host species, which contributes to the impressive diversity and range of infected hosts. Using multiple Wolbachia genes, including five developed for Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), the diversity and modes of movement of Wolbachia within the wasp genus Nasonia were investigated. Eleven different Wolbachia were found in the four species of Nasonia, including five newly identified infections. Five infections were acquired by horizontal transmission from other insect taxa, three have been acquired by hybridization between two Nasonia species, which resulted in a mitochondrial-Wolbachia sweep from one species to the other, and at least three have codiverged during speciation of their hosts. The results show that a variety of transfer mechanisms of Wolbachia are possible even within a single host genus. Codivergence of Wolbachia and their hosts is uncommon and provides a rare opportunity to investigate long-term Wolbachia evolution within a host lineage. Using synonymous divergence among codiverging infections and host nuclear genes, we estimate Wolbachia mutation rates to be approximately one-third that of the nuclear genome.

TI Host density and human activities mediate increased parasite prevalence
   and richness in primates threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation
AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are the principal causes of the loss of biological diversity. In addition, parasitic diseases are an emerging threat to many animals. Nevertheless, relatively few studies have tested how habitat loss and fragmentation influence the prevalence and richness of parasites in animals.
   Several studies of nonhuman primates have shown that measures of human activity and forest fragmentation correlate with parasitism in primates. However, these studies have not tested for the ecological mechanism(s) by which human activities or forest fragmentation influence the prevalence and richness of parasites.
   We tested the hypothesis that increased host density due to forest fragmentation and loss mediates increases in the prevalence and richness of gastrointestinal parasites in two forest primates, the Tana River red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus, Peters 1879) and mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus galeritus, Peters 1879). We focused on population density because epidemiological theory states that host density is a key determinant of the prevalence and richness of directly transmitted parasites in animals.
   The Tana River red colobus and mangabey are endemic to a highly fragmented forest ecosystem in eastern Kenya where habitat changes are caused by a growing human population increasingly dependent on forest resources and on clearing forest for cultivation.
   We found that the prevalence of parasites in the two monkeys was very high compared to primates elsewhere. Density of monkeys was positively associated with forest area and disturbance in forests. In turn, the prevalence and richness of parasites was significantly associated with monkey density, and attributes indicative of human disturbance in forests.
   We also found significant differences in the patterns of parasitism between the colobus and the mangabey possibly attributable to differences in their behavioural ecology. Colobus are arboreal folivores while mangabeys are terrestrial habitat generalists.

TI The Effects of Acute Malaria on Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Load and
   EBV-Specific T Cell Immunity in Gambian Children
AB Background. To investigate how intense Plasmodium falciparum infection predisposes to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt lymphoma (BL), we analyzed the effect of acute malaria on existing EBV-host balance.
   Methods. EBV genome loads in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and EBV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses were assayed by interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay.
   Results. Gambian children, from whom samples were obtained during an acute malaria attack and again up to 6 weeks later, had extremely high viral loads, reaching levels that in the United Kingdom are seen only in patients with infectious mononucleosis. Gambian control subjects ( children and adults with no recent history of malaria) had lower median viral loads, although they were still > 10-fold above the median for healthy UK adults. Limited experiments with EBV epitope peptides (restricted through the HLA-B*3501 and HLA-B*5301 alleles) also suggested an impairment of virus-specific CD8(+) T cell function in children with malaria, but only during acute disease.
   Conclusions. Acute malaria is associated with sustained increase in EBV load and, possibly, a transient decrease in EBV-specific T cell surveillance. We infer that the unusually high set point of virus carriage in P. falciparum challenged populations, allied with the parasite's capacity to act as a chronic B cell stimulus, probably contributes to the pathogenesis of endemic BL.

TI Signals Triggered by a Bacterial Pore-Forming Toxin Contribute to
   Toll-Like Receptor Redundancy in Gram-Positive Bacterial Recognition
AB Background. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 is the principal recognition receptor for gram-positive microbes. However, in some gram-positive bacterial infections, TLR2 is dispensable. One of the outstanding questions regarding host-bacteria interactions is why TLR2 is essential in some infections but dispensable in others.
   Methods. We used a combination of bacterial plating, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to analyze the inflammatory responses induced by Listeria monocytogenes and its toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) in vitro and in vivo. We analyzed wild-type, TLR2(-/-)-, TLR4(-/-)-, MyD88(-/-)-, interleukin (IL)-1 beta(-/-)-, and IL-18(-/-)-deficient mice and the bone marrow-derived mast cells obtained from these respective groups.
   Results. TLR2(-/-) mice had unaltered L. monocytogenes clearance and did not experience impairment of cytokine/chemokine induction and neutrophil mobilization by L. monocytogenes or purified LLO, but they were unresponsive to the LLO-deficient mutant L. monocytogenes (Lm Delta hly). We show that L. monocytogenes and LLO mediate such responses in part via interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-18-MyD88 pathways.
   Conclusions. The results illustrate that signals triggered by LLO contribute to TLR2 redundancy in recognition of L. monocytogenes. Under normal conditions, multiple and, sometimes, redundant pathways cooperate to induce a rapid antimicrobial defense. When one signaling pathway-in this case, TLR2-is removed from the system, the other pathways are still capable of mounting a sufficient response to ensure survival of the host.

TI Phylogenetic and population genetic divergence correspond with habitat
   for the pathogen Colletotrichum cereale and allied taxa across diverse
   grass communities
AB Over the past decade, the emergence of anthracnose disease has newly challenged the health of turfgrasses on North American golf courses, resulting in considerable economic loss. The fungus responsible for the outbreaks, Colletotrichum cereale, has also been identified from numerous natural grasses and cereal crops, although disease symptoms are generally absent. Here we utilize phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to determine the role of ecosystem in the advancement of turfgrass anthracnose and assess whether natural grass and/or cereal inhabitants are implicated in the epidemics. Using a four-gene nucleotide data set to diagnose the limits of phylogenetic species and population boundaries, we find that the graminicolous Colletotrichum diverged from a common ancestor into distinct lineages correspondent with host physiology (C3 or C4 photosynthetic pathways). In the C4 lineage, which includes the important cereal pathogens Colletotrichum graminicola, C. sublineolum, C. falcatum, C. eleusines, C. caudatum and several novel species, host specialization predominates, with host-associated lineages corresponding to isolated sibling species. Although the C3 lineage - C. cereale - is comprised of one wide host-range species, it is divided into 10 highly specialized populations corresponding to ecosystem and/or host plant, along with a single generalist population spread across multiple habitat types. Extreme differentiation between the specialized C. cereale populations suggests that asymptomatic nonturfgrass hosts are unlikely reservoirs of infectious disease propagules, but gene flow between the generalist population and the specialized genotypes provides an indirect mechanism for genetic exchange between otherwise isolated populations and ecosystems.

TI Spread of an introduced vector-borne banana virus in Hawaii
AB Emerging diseases are increasing in incidence; therefore, understanding how pathogens are introduced into new regions and cause epidemics is of importance for the development of strategies that may hinder their spread. We used molecular data to study how a vector-borne banana virus, Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), spread in Hawaii after it was first detected in 1989. Our analyses suggest that BBTV was introduced once into Hawaii, on the island of Oahu. All other islands were infected with isolates originating from Oahu, suggesting that movement of contaminated plant material was the main driving factor responsible for interisland spread of BBTV. The rate of mutation inferred by the phylogenetic analysis (1.4 x 10(-4) bp/year) was similar to that obtained in an experimental evolution study under greenhouse conditions (3.9 x 10(-4) bp/year). We used these values to estimate the number of infections occurring under field conditions per year. Our results suggest that strict and enforced regulations limiting the movement of banana plant material among Hawaiian islands could have reduced interisland spread of this pathogen.

TI Molecular genetic data provide support for a model of transmission
   dynamics in an Australian reptile tick, Bothriocroton hydrosauri
AB Bothriocroton hydrosauri is a three-host ixodid tick that infests large reptiles in southeastern Australia, where its most common host is a large scincid lizard Tiliqua rugosa. Based on previous ecological and behavioural studies of this system, we propose a 'ripple' model of tick population dynamics, where only a few female ticks succeed in producing surviving offspring. These females then are the centres of ripples of their progeny spreading into the broader landscape. The model predicts higher relatedness among larvae than among nymphs or adults on a host, and significant spatial autocorrelation in larvae extending further than for the later life stages. The model also predicts that adult ticks are likely to encounter related partners and that this will generate inbreeding within the population. We tested those predictions using nine polymorphic microsatellite loci on a sample of 848 ticks (464 larvae, 140 nymphs and 244 adults) collected from 98 lizard hosts from near Bundey Bore Station in South Australia. Our data support the predictions and indicate that the dynamics of transmission among hosts play an important role in parasite population structure.

TI An age-structured model to evaluate the potential of novel
   malaria-control interventions: a case study of fungal biopesticide
   sprays
AB It has recently been proposed that mosquito vectors of human diseases, particularly malaria, may be controlled by spraying with fungal biopesticides that increase the rate of adult mortality. Though fungal pathogens do not cause instantaneous mortality, they can kill mosquitoes before they are old enough to transmit disease. A model is developed (i) to explore the potential for fungal entomopathogens to reduce significantly infectious mosquito populations, (ii) to assess the relative value of the many different fungal strains that might be used, and (iii) to help guide the tactical design of vector-control programmes. The model follows the dynamics of different classes of adult mosquitoes with the risk of mortality due to the fungus being assumed to be a function of time since infection (modelled using the Weibull distribution). It is shown that substantial reductions in mosquito numbers are feasible for realistic assumptions about mosquito, fungus and malaria biology and moderate to low daily fungal infection probability. The choice of optimal fungal strain and spraying regime is shown to depend on local mosquito and malaria biology. Fungal pathogens may also influence the ability of mosquitoes to transmit malaria and such effects are shown to further reduce vectorial capacity.

TI Interactions between Genetic Drift, Gene Flow, and Selection Mosaics
   Drive Parasite Local Adaptation
AB Interactions between gene flow, spatially variable selection, and genetic drift have long been a central focus of evolutionary research. In contrast, only recently has the potential importance of interactions between these factors for coevolutionary dynamics and the emergence of parasite local adaptation been realized. Here we study host-parasite coevolution in a metapopulation model when both the biotic and the abiotic components of the environment vary in space. We provide a general expression for parasite local adaptation that allows local adaptation to be partitioned into the contributions of spatial covariances between host and parasite genotype frequencies within and between habitats. This partitioning clarifies how relative rates of gene flow, spatially variable patterns of selection, and genetic drift interact to shape parasite local adaptation. Specifically, by using this expression in conjunction with coevolutionary models, we show that genetic drift can dramatically increase the level of parasite local adaptation under some models of specificity. We also show that the effect of migration on parasite local adaptation depends on the geographic mosaic of selection. We discuss how these predictions could be tested empirically or experimentally using microbial systems.

TI Clonal diversity alters the infection dynamics of a malaria parasite
   (Plasmodium mexicanum) in its vertebrate host
AB Ecological and evolutionary theory predicts that genetic diversity of microparasites within infected hosts will influence the parasite replication rate, parasitemia, transmission strategy, and virulence. We manipulated clonal diversity (number of genotypes) of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium mexicanum, in its natural lizard host and measured important features of the infection dynamics, the first such study for any natural Plasmodium host association. Hosts harboring either a single P. mexicanum clone or various combinations of clones (scored via three microsatellite markers) were established. Production of asexually replicating stages (meronts) and maximal meront parasitemia did not differ by clonal diversity, nor did timing of first production of transmission stages (gametocytes). However, mean rate of gametocyte increase and maximal gametocyte parasitemia were greater for hosts with mixed-clone infections. Characteristics of infections were more variable in hosts with mixed-clone infections than with single-clone infections except for first production of gametocytes. One or more of the parasite reproductive traits were extreme in 20 of 52 hosts with mixed-clone infections. This was not associated with specific clones, but diversity itself. The overall pattern from studies of clonal diversity for human, rodent, and now reptile malaria parasites confirms that the genetic diversity of infections in the vertebrate host is of central importance for the ecology of Plasmodium.

TI Simian T-Lymphotropic Virus Diversity among Nonhuman Primates, Cameroon
AB Cross-species transmission of retroviruses is common in Cameroon. To determine risk for simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) transmission from nonhuman primates to hunters, we examined 170 hunter-collected dried blood spots (DBS) from 12 species for STLV. PCR with generic tax and group-specific long terminal repeat primers showed that 12 (7%) specimens from 4 nonhuman primate species were infected with STLV. Phylogenetic analyses showed broad diversity of STLV, including novel STLV-1 and STLV-3 sequences and a highly divergent STLV-3 subtype found in Cercopithecus mona and C. nictitans monkeys. Screening of peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA from 63 HTLV-seroreactive, PCR-negative hunters did not identify human infections with this divergent STLV-3. Therefore, hunter-collected DBS can effectively capture STLV diversity at the point where pathogen spillover occurs. Broad screening using this relatively easy collection strategy has potential for large-scale monitoring of retrovirus cross-species transmission among highly exposed human populations.

TI Haemophilus influenzae colonization and its risk factors in children
   aged < 2 years in northern India
AB The disease burden and the age group of children most affected by Haemophilus influenzae remain controversial particularly in many countries of South Asia. Nasopharyngeal carriage of H. influenzae can indicate the transmission dynamics in these settings. In a prospective population-based study, nasopharyngeal swabs from 1000 children aged <2 years, belonging to various socioeconomic groups from rural and urban areas of northern India were taken. The prevalence of H. influenzae carriage was found to be 11.2 %. Among these isolates, 69 % belonged to type b and the rest were non-typable. The age group most affected was 18-21 months. The carriage rate was influenced by age and socioeconomic factors namely type of housing, overcrowding, and season. Hib carriage is quite common in northern India and it is associated with age, type of housing, overcrowding, and season. Since carriage gets established early, Hib vaccination should target children in early infancy.

TI Hantavirus disease (nephropathia epidemica) in Belgium: effects of tree
   seed production and climate
AB Recently, human cases of nephropathia epidemica (NE) due to Puumala virus infection in Europe have increased. Following the hypothesis that high reservoir host abundance induces higher transmission rates to humans, explanations for this altered epidemiology must be sought in factors that cause bank vole (Myodes glareolus) abundance peaks. In Western Europe, these abundance peaks are often related to high tree seed production, which is supposedly triggered by specific weather conditions. We evaluated the relationship between tree seed production, climate and NE incidence in Belgium and show that NE epidemics are indeed preceded by abundant tree seed production. Moreover, a direct link between climate and NE incidence is found. High summer and autumn temperatures, 2 years and 1 year respectively before NE occurrence, relate to high NE incidence. This enables early forecasting of NE outbreaks. Since future climate change scenarios predict higher temperatures in Europe, we should regard Puumala virus as an increasing health threat.

TI Epidemics of squirrelpox virus disease in red squirrels (Sciurus
   vulgaris): temporal and serological findings
AB Squirrelpox virus (SQPV) causes a fatal disease in free-living red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) which has contributed to their decline in the United Kingdom. Given the difficulty of carrying out and funding experimental investigations on free-living wild mammals, data collected from closely monitored natural outbreaks of disease is crucial to our understanding of disease epidemiology. A conservation programme was initiated in the 1990s to bolster the population of red squirrels in the coniferous woodland of Thetford Chase, East Anglia. In 1996, 24 red squirrels were reintroduced to Thetford from Northumberland and Cumbria, while in 1999 a captive breeding and release programme commenced, but in both years the success of the projects was hampered by an outbreak of SQPV disease in which seven and four red squirrels died respectively. Valuable information on the host-pathogen dynamics of SQPV disease was gathered by telemetric and mark-recapture monitoring of the red squirrels. SQPV disease characteristics were comparable to other virulent poxviral infections: the incubation period was <15 days; the course of the disease an average of 10 days and younger animals were significantly more susceptible to disease. SQPV disease places the conservation of the red squirrel in jeopardy in the United Kingdom unless practical disease control methods can be identified.

TI EVOLUTION OF INCOMPATIBILITY-INDUCING MICROBES IN SUBDIVIDED HOST
   POPULATIONS
AB Many insects, other arthropods, and nematodes harbor maternally inherited bacteria inducing "cytoplasmic incompatibility" (CI), reduced egg hatch when infected males mate with uninfected females. Although CI drives the spread of these microbes, selection on alternative, mutually compatible strains in panmictic host populations does not act directly on CI intensity but favors higher "effective fecundity," the number of infected progeny an infected female produces. We analyze the consequences of host population subdivision using deterministic and stochastic models. In subdivided populations, effective fecundity remains the primary target of selection. For strains of equal effective fecundity, if population density is regulated locally (i.e., "soft selection"), variation among patches in infection frequencies may induce change in the relative frequencies of the strains. However, whether this change favors stronger incompatibility depends on initial frequencies. Demographic fluctuations maintain frequency variation that tends to favor stronger incompatibility. However, this effect is weak; even with small patches, minute increases in effective fecundity can offset substantial decreases in CI intensity. These results are insensitive to many details of host life cycle and migration and to systematic outbreeding or inbreeding within patches. Selection acting through transfer between host species may be required to explain the prevalence of CI.

TI The microbial dimension in insect nutritional ecology
AB Many insects derive nutritional advantage from persistent associations with microorganisms that variously synthesize essential nutrients or digest and detoxify ingested food. These persistent relationships are symbioses.
   There is strong experimental evidence that symbiotic microorganisms provide plant sap-feeding insects with essential amino acids and contribute to the digestion of cellulose in some wood-feeding insects, including lower termites. Basic nutritional information is, however, lacking for many associations, including the relative roles of microbial and intrinsic sources of cellulose degradation in many insects and B-vitamin provisioning by microorganisms in blood-feeding insects.
   Some nutritional interactions between insects and their symbiotic microorganisms vary among conspecifics and closely related species. This variation can, in principle, contribute to nutritional explanations for variation in the abundance and distribution of insects. For example, the plant utilization traits of phloem-feeding aphids and stinkbugs have been demonstrated to depend on the identity of microbial partners. Evidence that associations can evolve rapidly comes from the demonstration that the impact of the bacterium Wolbachia on natural populations of its insect host can change from deleterious to beneficial within two decades.
   Developing genomic tools, especially massively parallel sequencing and metagenomic analyses, offer the opportunity to explore the metabolic capabilities of symbiotic microorganisms and their insect hosts, from which defined hypotheses of nutritional function can be constructed. Nutritional ecology provides the appropriate framework to test these hypotheses in the relevant ecological context.

TI Measured immunocompetence relates to the proportion of dead parasites in
   a wild roach population
AB Although various methods are used to measure immunocompetence, their relationship with the actual parasite clearance or parasite load is seldom demonstrated in natural systems.
   We combined nine measures of immune function using principal component analysis (PCA), and examined the relationship of the collective measures with (i) the proportion of parasites killed by the host, (ii) the burden of several parasite species and (iii) a viral disease in a wild population of the roach, Rutilus rutilus. We also studied if these variables were associated with the concentration of steroids (testosterone and oestradiol).
   Most significant correlations between the loads of ecto- and gill parasites and the measures of immunity were positive, suggesting either a parasite-induced immunoactivation or temporal covariation. When the temporal covariation was statistically removed, the functional aspects (respiratory burst, chemotaxis) of phagocytotic cells and the total concentration of immunoglobulin M correlated positively with the proportion of dead Rhipidocotyle campanula (Digenea) parasites.
   However, no relationships remained between the parasite loads and the measures of immunity or concentrations of the hormones.
   The present results suggest that the measures of phagocytotic activity and IgM concentrations relate to an observable competence of roach to eliminate parasites. However, new experimental approaches are needed to reveal the causal mechanisms behind the sometimes ambiguous correlations.

TI Virulence evolution and the trade-off hypothesis: history, current state
   of affairs and the future
AB It has been more than two decades since the formulation of the so-called 'trade-off' hypothesis as an alternative to the then commonly accepted idea that parasites should always evolve towards avirulence (the 'avirulence hypothesis'). The trade-off hypothesis states that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of parasite transmission; however, since the 1990s, this hypothesis has been increasingly challenged. We discuss the history of the study of virulence evolution and the development of theories towards the trade-off hypothesis in order to illustrate the context of the debate. We investigate the arguments raised against the trade-off hypothesis and argue that trade-offs exist, but may not be of the simple form that is usually assumed, involving other mechanisms (and life-history traits) than those originally considered. Many processes such as pathogen adaptation to within-host competition, interactions with the immune system and shifting transmission routes, will all be interrelated making sweeping evolutionary predictions harder to obtain. We argue that this is the heart of the current debate in the field and while species-specific models may be better predictive tools, the trade-off hypothesis and its basic extensions are necessary to assess the qualitative impacts of virulence management strategies.

TI Effects of antagonistic coevolution on parasite-mediated host
   coexistence
AB Parasites can promote diversity by mediating coexistence between a poorer and superior competitor, if the superior competitor is more susceptible to parasitism. However, hosts and parasites frequently undergo antagonistic coevolution. This process may result in the accumulation of pleiotropic fitness costs associated with host resistance, and could breakdown coexistence. We experimentally investigated parasite-mediated coexistence of two genotypes of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, where one genotype underwent coevolution with a parasite (a virulent bacteriophage), whereas the other genotype was resistant to the evolving phages at all time points, but a poorer competitor. In the absence of phages, the resistant genotype was rapidly driven extinct in all populations. In the presence of the phages, the resistant genotype persisted in four of six populations and eventually reached higher frequencies than the sensitive genotype. The coevolving genotype showed a reduction in the growth rate, consistent with a cost of resistance, which may be responsible for a decline in its relative fitness. These results demonstrate that the stability of parasite-mediated coexistence of resistant and susceptible species or genotypes is likely to be affected if parasites and susceptible hosts coevolve.

TI Host genetic architecture in single and multiple infections
AB Hosts are often target to multiple simultaneous infections by genetically diverse parasite strains. The interaction among these strains and the interaction of each strain with the host was shown to have profound effects on the evolution of parasite traits. Host factors like genetic architecture of resistance have so far been largely neglected. To see whether genetic architecture differs between different kinds of infections we used joint scaling analysis to compare the genetic components of resistance in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum exposed to single and multiple strains of the microsporidian Nosema whitei. Our results indicate that additive, dominance and epistatic components were more important in single infections whereas maternal components play a decisive role in multiple infections. In detail, parameter estimates of additive, dominance and epistatic components correlated positively between single and multiple infections, whereas maternal components correlated negatively. These findings may suggest that specificity of host-parasite interactions are mediated by genetic and especially epistatic components whereas maternal effects constitute a more general form of resistance.

   and meta-analysis of observational studies
AB We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies of the risk of HIV-1 transmission per heterosexual contact. 43 publications comprising 25 different study populations were identified. Pooled female-to-male (0.04% per act [95% CI 0.01-0.14]) and male-to-female (0.08% per act [95% CI 0.06-0.11]) transmission estimates in high-income countries indicated a low risk of infection in the absence of antiretrovirals. Low-income country female-to-male (0.38% per act [95% CI 0.13-1.10]) and male-to-female (0.30% per act [95% CI 0.14-0.63]) estimates in the absence of commercial sex exposure (CSE) were higher. In meta-regression analysis, the infectivity across estimates in the absence of CSE was significantly associated with sex, setting, the interaction between setting and sex, and antenatal HIV prevalence. The pooled receptive anal intercourse estimate was much higher (1.7% per act [95% CI 0.3-8.9]). Estimates for the early and late phases of HIV infection were 9.2 (95% CI 4.5-18.8) and 7.3 (95% CI 4.5-11.9) times larger, respectively, than for the asymptomatic phase. After adjusting for CSE, presence or history of genital ulcers in either couple member increased per-act infectivity 5.3 (95% CI 1.4-19.5) times versus no sexually transmitted infection. Study estimates among non-circumcised men were at least twice those among circumcised men. Low-income country estimates were more heterogeneous than high-income country estimates, which indicates poorer study quality, greater heterogeneity of risk factors, or under-reporting of high-risk behaviour. Efforts are needed to better understand these differences and to quantify infectivity in low-income countries.

TI Proteomic and phenotypic profiling of the amphibian pathogen
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis shows that genotype is linked to
   virulence
AB Population genetics of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) show that isolates are highly related and globally homogenous, data that are consistent with the recent epidemic spread of a previously endemic organism. Highly related isolates are predicted to be functionally similar due to low levels of heritable genetic diversity. To test this hypothesis, we took a global panel of Bd isolates and measured (i) the genetic relatedness among isolates, (ii) proteomic profiles of isolates, (iii) the susceptibility of isolates to the antifungal drug caspofungin, (iv) the variation among isolates in growth and phenotypic characteristics, and (v) the virulence of isolates against the European common toad Bufo bufo. Our results show (i) genotypic differentiation among isolates, (ii) proteomic differentiation among isolates, (iii) no significant differences in susceptibility to caspofungin, (iv) differentiation in growth and phenotypic/morphological characters, and (v) differential virulence in B. bufo. Specifically, our data show that Bd isolates can be profiled by their genotypic and proteomic characteristics, as well as by the size of their sporangia. Bd genotypic and phenotypic distance matrices are significantly correlated, showing that less-related isolates are more biologically unique. Mass spectrometry has identified a set of candidate genes associated with inter-isolate variation. Our data show that, despite its rapid global emergence, Bd isolates are not identical and differ in several important characters that are linked to virulence. We argue that future studies need to clarify the mechanism(s) and rate at which Bd is evolving, and the impact that such variation has on the host-pathogen dynamic.

TI Local and Global Effects of Climate on Dengue Transmission in Puerto
   Rico
AB The four dengue viruses, the agents of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in humans, are transmitted predominantly by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The abundance and the transmission potential of Ae. aegypti are influenced by temperature and precipitation. While there is strong biological evidence for these effects, empirical studies of the relationship between climate and dengue incidence in human populations are potentially confounded by seasonal covariation and spatial heterogeneity. Using 20 years of data and a statistical approach to control for seasonality, we show a positive and statistically significant association between monthly changes in temperature and precipitation and monthly changes in dengue transmission in Puerto Rico. We also found that the strength of this association varies spatially, that this variation is associated with differences in local climate, and that this relationship is consistent with laboratory studies of the impacts of these factors on vector survival and viral replication. These results suggest the importance of temperature and precipitation in the transmission of dengue viruses and suggest a reason for their spatial heterogeneity. Thus, while dengue transmission may have a general system, its manifestation on a local scale may differ from global expectations.

TI Predicting the Timing and Magnitude of Tropical Mosquito Population
   Peaks for Maximizing Control Efficiency
AB The transmission of mosquito-borne diseases is strongly linked to the abundance of the host vector. Identifying the environmental and biological precursors which herald the onset of peaks in mosquito abundance would give health and land-use managers the capacity to predict the timing and distribution of the most efficient and cost-effective mosquito control. We analysed a 15-year time series of monthly abundance of Aedes vigilax, a tropical mosquito species from northern Australia, to determine periodicity and drivers of population peaks (high-density outbreaks). Two sets of density-dependent models were used to examine the correlation between mosquito abundance peaks and the environmental drivers of peaks or troughs (low-density periods). The seasonal peaks of reproduction (r) and abundance (Npeak) occur at the beginning of September and early November, respectively. The combination of low mosquito abundance and a low frequency of a high tide exceeding 7 m in the previous low-abundance (trough) period were the most parsimonious predictors of a peak's magnitude, with this model explaining over 50% of the deviance in Npeak. Model weights, estimated using AIC(c), were also relatively high for those including monthly maximum tide height, monthly accumulated tide height or total rainfall per month in the trough, with high values in the trough correlating negatively with the onset of a high-abundance peak. These findings illustrate that basic environmental monitoring data can be coupled with relatively simple density feedback models to predict the timing and magnitude of mosquito abundance peaks. Decision-makers can use these methods to determine optimal levels of control (i.e., least-cost measures yielding the largest decline in mosquito abundance) and so reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in human populations.

TI Nestling Passerines Are Not Important Hosts for Amplification of West
   Nile Virus in Chicago, Illinois
AB Nestling birds have been hypothesized to be important hosts for mosquito-borne arboviruses, but the role of nestlings for West Nile virus (WNV) amplification remains unclear. We sampled open-cup and cavity-nesting passerines in Chicago, Illinois, an area of intense WNV transmission, to determine infection rates in nestlings and mosquitoes, and to test whether mosquitoes are attracted to nesting birds. Analysis of Culex pipiens mosquito populations demonstrated WNV amplification to high mosquito infection rates during both years of the study near the locations where nestlings were sampled. Nevertheless, of 194 nestlings representing 12 species, only one 8-day-old house wren was positive for WNV RNA, and only one 10-day-old mourning dove was seropositive for antibodies to WNV, but at a low titer (1:20). The number of mosquitoes captured in nest box traps and control traps was not significantly different. These combined results suggest that nestling passerines play no evident role in WNV amplification and transmission in the Chicago area.

TI The Acquisition and Internalization of Salmonella by the Lesser
   Mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)
AB In poultry broiler production facilities, it is important to understand the sources and contribution of reservoir populations of pathogens. The lesser mealworm beetle, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer), is a common pest in poultry litter that is reported to carry pathogens affecting both human and animal health. This study investigates whether the carriage of a bacterial pathogen occurs by the harboring of bacteria internally by these insects. Beetles were exposed to a marker bacterium, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-green fluorescent protein (ST-GFP), at concentrations up to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/mL for 0.5 to 12 h, and then subsequently surface disinfected and dissected. The head, gastrointestinal tract and hemolymph were cultured for the presence of ST-GFP. This study definitively demonstrates the internal carriage of Salmonella by this insect and found that the beetles rapidly acquired bacteria from external sources and harbored the bacteria within their alimentary canal after exposure for 30 min at 10(4) cfu/mL and within the hemolymph after exposure for 2 h at 10(6) cfu/mL. Beetles internalized an average of 9.5 X 10(1) and 3.2 X 10(3) after a 2-h exposure to 2 X 10(4) and 2 X 10(6) cfu/mL, respectively. The lesser mealworm is a serious pest within the poultry brooder and laying industry and because of their mobility, voracious feeding habits, and prey potential may represent an active source facilitating the dissemination of Salmonella.

TI Inferring malaria parasite population structure from serological
   networks
AB The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is characterized by high levels of genetic diversity at antigenic loci involved in virulence and immune evasion. Knowledge of the population structure and dynamics of these genes is important for designing control programmes and understanding the acquisition of immunity to malaria; however, high rates of homologous and non-homologous recombination as well as complex patterns of expression within hosts have hindered attempts to elucidate these structures experimentally. Here, we analyse serological data from Kenya using a novel network technique to deconstruct the relationships between patients' immune responses to different parasite isolates. We show that particular population structures and expression patterns produce distinctive signatures within serological networks of parasite recognition, which can be used to discriminate between competing hypotheses regarding the organization of these genes. Our analysis suggests that different levels of immune selection occur within different groups of the same multigene family leading to mixed population structures.

TI Selection of HIV Variants with Signature Genotypic Characteristics
   during Heterosexual Transmission
AB Background. Newly infected subjects acquire a limited number of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants with specific genotypic and phenotypic features from the array of viruses present in a chronically infected transmitting partner.
   Methods. We examined HIV-1 envelope sequences from the earliest available serum sample after HIV-1 acquisition in 13 newly infected subjects and from their epidemiologically linked HIV-1-infected heterosexual partner. Samples from both members were collected on the same day in the Rakai Community Cohort Study.
   Results. Ten couples were infected with subtype D HIV-1, and 3 pairs had subtype A HIV-1. Newly infected subjects acquired a subset of the viruses that were circulating in the transmitting partner; transmitted variants had less diversity and divergence and were more closely related to the ancestral sequences. The majority of signature amino acid differences among donor and recipient sequences were in and immediately following the V3 loop. Envelopes from recipients were significantly shorter and had a lower V3 charge than envelopes from donors, but there was no significant difference in the number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites.
   Conclusion. A minority subset of HIV-1 variants with signature genotypes is favored for transmission in this population.

TI Interactions among co-infecting parasite species: a mechanism
   maintaining genetic variation in parasites?
AB Individuals of free-living organisms are often infected simultaneously by a community of parasites. If the co-infecting parasites interact, then this can add significantly to the diversity of host genotype! parasite genotype interactions. However, interactions between parasite species are usually not examined considering potential variation in interactions between different strain combinations of co-infecting parasites. Here, we examined the importance of interactions between strains of fish eye flukes Diplostomum spathaceum and Diplostomum gasterostei on their infectivity in naive fish hosts. We assessed the infection success of strains of both species in single-strain exposures and in co-exposures with a random strain of the other species. Parasite infection success did not consistently increase or decrease in the co-exposure treatment, but depended on the combinations of co-infecting parasite strains. This disrupted the relative infectivity of D. spathaceum strains observed in single-strain exposures. The infection success of D. gasterostei strains was independent of exposure type. These results suggest that interactions among parasite species may be strain specific and potentially promote maintenance of genetic polymorphism in parasite populations.

TI Age-Dependent Acquisition of Protective Immunity to Malaria in Riverine
   Populations of the Amazon Basin of Brazil
AB Five community-based cross-sectional surveys of malaria morbidity and associated risk factors in remote riverine populations in northwestern Brazil showed average parasite rates of 4.2% (thick-smear microscopy) and 14.4% (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) in the overall population, with a spleen rate of 13.9% among children 2-9 years of age. Plasmodium vivax was 2.8 times more prevalent than P. falciparum, with rare instances of P. malariae and mixed-species infections confirmed by PCR; 9.6% of asymptomatic subjects had parasitemias detected by PCR. Low-grade parasitemia detected by PCR only was a risk factor for anemia, after controlling for age and other covariates. Although clinical and subclinical infections occurred in all age groups, the risk of infection and disease decreased significantly with increasing age, after adjustment for several covariates in multilevel logistic regression models. These findings suggest that the continuous exposure to hypo- or mesoendemic malaria may induce significant anti-parasite and anti-disease immunity in native Amazonians.

TI Diversity and Composition of Viral Communities: Coinfection of Barley
   and Cereal Yellow Dwarf Viruses in California Grasslands
AB Most species host multiple pathogens, yet field studies rarely examine the processes determining pathogen diversity within a single host or the effects of coinfection on pathogen dynamics in natural systems. Coinfection can affect pathogen transmission and virulence. In turn, coinfection can be regulated within hosts by interactions such as cross-protective immunity or at broader spatial scales via vector distributions. Using a general model, we demonstrate that coinfection by a group of vectored pathogens is highest with abundant generalist vectors and weak cross-protection and coinfection-induced mortality. Using these predictions, we investigate the distribution of five coexisting aphid-vectored, viral pathogens (barley and cereal yellow dwarf luteoviruses and poleroviruses) in a native perennial grass (Elymus glaucus) in both space (700 km) and time (4 years). Observed coinfection rates were much higher than expected at random, suggesting that within-host processes exerted weak effects on within-host pathogen diversity. Covariance among viruses in space and time was highest for viral species sharing a vector. Temporal correlation arose from the synchronous invasion of two viruses transmitted by a shared aphid species. On the basis of our modeling and empirical results, we expect that factors external to individual hosts may affect the coinfection dynamics in other communities hosting vectored pathogens.

TI Industrial Food Animal Production and Global Health Risks: Exploring the
   Ecosystems and Economics of Avian Influenza
AB Many emerging infectious diseases in human populations are associated with zoonotic origins. Attention has often focused on wild animal reservoirs, but most zoonotic pathogens of recent concern to human health either originate in, or are transferred to, human populations from domesticated animals raised for human consumption. Thus, the ecological context of emerging infectious disease comprises two overlapping ecosystems: the natural habitats and populations of wild animals, and the anthropogenically controlled habitats and populations of domesticated species. Intensive food animal production systems and their associated value chains dominate in developed countries and are increasingly important in developing countries. These systems are characterized by large numbers of animals being raised in confinement with high throughput and rapid turnover. Although not typically recognized as such, industrial food animal production generates unique ecosystems-environments that may facilitate the evolution of zoonotic pathogens and their transmission to human populations. It is often assumed that confined food animal production reduces risks of emerging zoonotic diseases. This article provides evidence suggesting that these industrial systems may increase animal and public health risks unless there is recognition of the specific biosecurity and biocontainment challenges of the industrial model. Moreover, the economic drivers and constraints faced by the industry and its participants must be fully understood in order to inform preventative policy. In order to more effectively reduce zoonotic disease risk from industrial food animal production, private incentives for the implementation of biosecurity must align with public health interests.

TI Risk of Malaria Reemergence in Southern France: Testing Scenarios with a
   Multiagent Simulation Model
AB The Camargue, a region in southern France, is considered a potential site for malaria reemergence. All the suitable factors of the disease transmission system are present-competent mosquito vectors, habitats for their breeding, and susceptible people-except for the parasite. The objective of this study was to test potential drivers of malaria reemergence in this system after possible changes in biological attributes of vectors, agricultural practices, land use, tourism activities, and climate. Scenarios of plausible futures were formulated and then simulated using a spatially explicit and dynamic multiagent simulation: the MALCAM model. Scenarios were developed by varying the value of model inputs. Model outputs were compared based on the contact rate between people and potential malaria vectors, and the number of new infections in case of reintroduction of the parasite in the region. Model simulations showed that the risk of malaria reemergence is low in the Camargue. If the disease would reemerge, it would be the result of a combination of unfavorable conditions: introduction of a large population of infectious people or mosquitoes, combined with high levels of people-vector contacts resulting from significant changes in land use, tourism activities, agricultural policies, biological evolution of mosquitoes, and climate changes. The representation in the MALCAM model of interactions and feedbacks between different agents, and between agents and their environment, led in some cases to counterintuitive results. Results from scenario analyses can help local public health authorities in policy formulation.

TI Friendly competition: evidence for a dilution effect among competitors
   in a planktonic host-parasite system
AB The "dilution effect'' concept in disease ecology offers the intriguing possibility that clever manipulation of less competent hosts could reduce disease prevalence in populations of more competent hosts. The basic concept is straightforward: host species vary in suitability ( competence) for parasites, and disease transmission decreases when there are more incompetent hosts interacting with vectors or removing free-living stages of a parasite. However, host species also often interact with each other in other ecological ways, e. g., as competitors for resources. The net result of these simultaneous, multiple interactions ( disease dilution and resource competition) is challenging to predict. Nonetheless, we see the signature of both roles operating concurrently in a planktonic host-parasite system. We document pronounced spatiotemporal variation in the size of epidemics of a virulent fungus (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) in Midwestern U. S. lake populations of a dominant crustacean grazer ( Daphnia dentifera). We show that some of this variation is captured by changes in structure of Daphnia assemblages. Lake-years with smaller epidemics were characterized by assemblages dominated by less suitable hosts ("diluters,'' D. pulicaria and D. retrocurva, whose suitabilties were determined in lab experiments and field surveys) at the start of epidemics. Furthermore, within a season, less suitable hosts increased as epidemics declined. These observations are consistent with a dilution effect. However, more detailed time series analysis ( using multivariate autoregressive models) of three intensively sampled epidemics show the signature of a likely interaction between dilution and resource competition between these Daphnia species. The net outcome of this interaction likely promoted termination of these fungal outbreaks. Should this outcome always arise in "friendly competition'' systems where diluting hosts compete with more competent hosts? The answers to this question lie at a frontier of disease ecology.

TI Meeting the Challenge of Influenza Pandemic Preparedness in Developing
   Countries
AB Developing countries face unique difficulties preparing for an influenza pandemic. Our current top-down approach will not provide these countries with adequate supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents. Consequently, they will have to use a bottom-up approach based on inexpensive generic agents that either modify the host response to influenza virus or act as antiviral agents. Several of these agents have shown promise, and many are currently produced in developing countries. Investigators must primarily identify agents for managing infection in populations and not simply seek explanations for how they work. They must determine in which countries these agents are produced and define patterns of distribution and costs. Because prepandemic research cannot establish whether these agents will be effective in a pandemic, randomized controlled trials must begin immediately after a new pandemic virus has emerged. Without this research, industrialized and developing countries could face an unprecedented health crisis.

TI No coexistence for free: Neutral null models for multistrain pathogens
AB In most pathogens, multiple strains are maintained within host populations. Quantifying the mechanisms underlying strain coexistence would aid public health planning and improve understanding of disease dynamics. We argue that mathematical models of strain coexistence, when applied to indistinguishable strains, should meet criteria for both ecological neutrality and population genetic neutrality. We show that closed clonal transmission models which can be written in an "ancestor-tracing" form that meets the former criterion will also satisfy the latter. Neutral models can be a parsimonious starting point for studying mechanisms of strain coexistence; implications for past and future studies are discussed. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Effects of abundance on infection in natural populations: Field voles
   and cowpox virus
AB Detailed results on the dynamics of cowpox virus infection in four natural populations of the field vole, Microtus agrestis, are presented. Populations were sampled every 4 weeks (8 weeks in mid-winter) for 6 years. The purpose was to examine the relationships between overall or susceptible host abundance (N, S) and both the number of infected hosts (I) and the prevalence of infection (I/N). Overall, both I and I/N increased with N. However, evidence for a threshold abundance, below which infection was not found, was at best equivocal in spite of the wide range of abundances sampled. Cross-correlation analyses reflected annual and multi-annual cycles in N, I, S and I/N, but whereas N was most strongly correlated with contemporary values of I and I/N, in the case of S, the strongest correlations were with values 1 to 2 months preceding the values of I and I/N. There was no evidence for a 'juvenile dilution effect' (prevalence decreasing with abundance as new susceptibles flush into the population) and only weak evidence of a time-delayed effect of abundance on the number infected. We argue that these effects may occur only in systems with characteristics that are not found here. Transfer function analyses, which have been neglected in epidemiology, were applied. These models, with ln(S) as the input parameter, in spite of their simplicity, could be linked closely to conventional formulations of the transmission process and were highly effective in predicting the number infected. By contrast, transfer function models with ln(N) as the input parameter were less successful in predicting the number infected and/or were more complex and more difficult to interpret. Nonetheless, overall, we contend that while monitoring numbers susceptible has most to offer, monitoring overall abundance may provide valuable insights into the dynamics of infection.

TI ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AFFECT EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORY IN A PREDATOR-PREY
   SYSTEM
AB The arms race of adaptation and counter adaptation in predator-prey interactions is a fascinating evolutionary dynamic with many consequences, including local adaptation and the promotion or maintenance of diversity. Although such antagonistic coevolution is suspected to be widespread in nature, experimental documentation of the process remains scant, and we have little understanding of the impact of ecological conditions. Here, we present evidence of predator-prey coevolution in a long-term experiment involving the predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and the prey Pseudomonas fluorescens, which has three morphs (SM, FS, and WS). Depending on experimentally applied disturbance regimes, the predator-prey system followed two distinct evolutionary trajectories, where the prey evolved to be either super-resistant to predation (SM morph) without counter-adaptation by the predator, or moderately resistant (FS morph), specialized to and coevolving with the predator. Although predation-resistant FS morphs suffer a cost of resistance, the evolution of extreme resistance to predation by the SM morph was apparently unconstrained by other traits (carrying capacity, growth rate). Thus we demonstrate empirically that ecological conditions can shape the evolutionary trajectory of a predator-prey system.

TI Can the protein costs of bacterial resistance be offset by altered
   feeding behaviour?
AB Mounting an immune response is likely to be costly in terms of energy and nutrients, and so it is predicted that dietary intake should change in response to infection to offset these costs. The present study focuses on the interactions between a specialist grass-feeding caterpillar species, the African armyworm Spodoptera exempta, and an opportunist bacterium, Bacillus subtilis.
   The main aims of the study were (i) to establish the macronutrient costs to the insect host of surviving a systemic bacterial infection, (ii) to determine the relative importance of dietary protein and carbohydrate to immune system functions, and (iii) to determine whether there is an adaptive change in the host's normal feeding behaviour in response to bacterial challenge, such that the nutritional costs of resisting infection are offset.
   We show that the survival of bacterially infected larvae increased with increasing dietary protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio, suggesting a protein cost associated with bacterial resistance. As dietary protein levels increased, there was an increase in antibacterial activity, phenoloxidase (PO) activity and protein levels in the haemolymph, providing a potential source for this protein cost. However, there was also evidence for a physiological trade-off between antibacterial activity and phenoloxidase activity, as larvae whose antibacterial activity levels were elevated in response to immune activation had reduced PO activity.
   When given a choice between two diets varying in their P:C ratios, larvae injected with a sub-lethal dose of bacteria increased their protein intake relative to control larvae whilst maintaining similar carbohydrate intake levels. These results are consistent with the notion that S. exempta larvae alter their feeding behaviour in response to bacterial infection in a manner that is likely to enhance the levels of protein available for producing the immune system components and other factors required to resist bacterial infections ('self-medication').

TI Interactions between harvesting, noise and territoriality in a model of
   red grouse population cycles
AB Population cycles are mostly thought to arise through extrinsic rather than intrinsic processes. However, in red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus), intrinsic male territoriality has been proposed as a driver of the cycles, possibly in conjunction with an extrinsic interaction with specialist parasitic worms. Here we examine how harvesting and environmental noise may also interact with territoriality to determine how grouse populations cycle.
   A stochastic model of grouse dynamics based on the territoriality hypothesis is developed, including harvesting and the effects of nonterritorial birds on aggressiveness. Cycles are detected in 97% of populations simulated over realistic parameter ranges, and these exhibit similar statistical properties to those reported in studies of multiple grouse populations. As observed, cycle periods are shorter at higher breeding productivities.
   The model demonstrates the destabilizing influence of delayed density-dependent territorial aggressiveness. Cycle amplitudes are higher when annual changes in aggression are larger and when nonterritorial males provoke greater aggression. Intriguingly, the model suggests how an interaction between aggressiveness and parasites may operate. It is known that males with high worm burdens show dramatic decreases in aggressiveness in the year following a peak in territoriality. When this is included in the model, via larger crashes in aggression, amplitudes are higher, despite a reduction in overall aggressiveness.
   Environmental stochasticity interacts with territoriality to determine the form of the cycles, but this is mediated through its 'colour' or temporal autocorrelation. For example, uncorrelated white noise increases amplitudes, while autocorrelated red noise has the opposite effect. However, noise increases cycle periods whatever the colour.
   Harvesting occurs before territorial competition. This reduces the pool of males competing for territories and so increases recruitment and population densities. However, crashes can then be more extreme so cycle amplitudes are higher. With harvesting at 150% of current typical levels, which is within observed variation, the dynamics exhibit a sharp transition to a state where cyclicity is reduced, periods are shorter and amplitudes lower.
   The model suggests that to understand regional variation in red grouse cycles, interactions between territoriality, productivity, harvesting and noise must be considered.

TI Pathogenesis of H5N1 Influenza Virus Infections in Mice and Ferret
   Models Differs According to Respiratory Tract or Digestive System
   Exposure
AB Background. Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data suggest that H5N1 influenza viruses are transmitted through and predominantly affect the respiratory system of mammals. Some data suggest digestive system involvement. However, direct evidence of alimentary transmission and infection in mammals is lacking.
   Methods. Infection with and pathogenesis of 4 H5N1 viruses were assessed in mice and ferrets inoculated intra-nasally or intragastrically with virus in liquid. In addition, ferrets were fed infected raw chicken meat or minced meat administered into the stomach by gavage with a tube.
   Results. Only one virus, A/Whooper swan/Mongolia/244/05, was able to infect mice after intragastric inoculation in liquid, whereas no evidence of infection was observed in ferrets after intragastric inoculation. Consumption of infected meat by ferrets resulted in respiratory system infection only (due to A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/209/05 and A/Whooper swan/Mongolia/244/05 viruses) or in both severe respiratory and systemic infection with predominant involvement of the liver, pancreas, and large and small intestine (due to A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus). Direct intragastric exposure to infected meat (A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus) resulted in lethal systemic disease mainly affecting the intestine, liver, and pancreas but not involving the lungs.
   Conclusions. Our results demonstrated that exposure of the digestive system to H5N1 influenza viruses could initiate infection either through the tonsil, with spread to respiratory tissues, or through intestinal infection, with spread to the liver and pancreas.

TI Decreasing Efficacy of Antimalarial Combination Therapy in Uganda Is
   Explained by Decreasing Host Immunity Rather than Increasing Drug
   Resistance
AB Background. Improved control efforts are reducing the burden of malaria in Africa but may result in decreased antimalarial immunity.
   Methods. A cohort of 129 children aged 1-10 years in Kampala, Uganda, were treated with amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for 396 episodes of uncomplicated malaria over a 29-month period as part of a longitudinal clinical trial.
   Results. The risk of treatment failure increased over the course of the study from 5% to 21% (hazard ratio [HR], 2.4 per year [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.3-4.3]). Parasite genetic polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk of failure, but their prevalence did not change over time. Three markers of antimalarial immunity were associated with a decreased risk of treatment failure: increased age (HR, 0.5 per 5-year increase [95% CI, 0.2-1.2]), living in an area of higher malaria incidence (HR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.11-0.64]), and recent asymptomatic parasitemia (HR, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01-0.36]). In multivariate analysis, adjustment for recent asymptomatic parasitemia, but not parasite polymorphisms, removed the association between calendar time and the risk of treatment failure (HR, 1.5 per year [95% CI, 0.7-3.4]), suggesting that worsening treatment efficacy was best explained by decreasing host immunity.
   Conclusion. Declining immunity in our study population appeared to be the primary factor underlying decreased efficacy of amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. With improved malaria-control efforts, decreasing immunity may unmask resistance to partially efficacious drugs.

TI Evidence of parasite-mediated disruptive selection on genetic diversity
   in a wild fish population
AB Identifying the processes maintaining genetic variability in wild populations is a major concern in conservation and evolutionary biology. Parasite-mediated selection may strongly affect genetic variability in wild populations. The inbreeding depression theory predicts that directional selection imposed by parasites should act against the most inbred hosts, thus favouring genetic diversity in wild populations. We have tested this prediction by evaluating the strength and shape of the relationship between the load of a harmful fin-feeder ectoparasite (Tracheliastes polycolpus) and the genome-wide genetic diversity (i.e. heterozygosity measured at a set of 15 microsatellites) of its fish host, the rostrum dace (Leuciscus leuciscus). Contrary to expectation, we found a nonlinear relationship between host genetic diversity and ectoparasite load, with hosts that were either homozygous or heterozygous harbouring significantly fewer parasites than hosts with an intermediate level of heterozygosity. This relationship suggests that parasites could increase the variance of global heterozygosity in this host population through disruptive selection on genetic diversity. Moreover, when genetic diversity was measured at each locus separately, we found two very strong positive associations between host genetic diversity and the ectoparasite load. This latter result has three main implications: (i) genome-wide effect cannot alone explain the nonlinear relationship between global heterozygosity and ectoparasite load, (ii) negative non-additive allelic interactions (i.e. underdominance) may be a mechanism for resisting ectoparasite infection, and (iii) ectoparasites may favour homozygosity at some loci in this host population.

TI Major histocompatibility complex variability in the clonal Amazon molly,
   Poecilia formosa: is copy number less important than genotype?
AB The evolution of sex is still a major unsolved puzzle in biology. One of the most promising theoretical models to answer this question is the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen hypothesis proposes a fast adaptation of pathogens to common genotypes and therefore a negative frequency-dependent selection against common genotypes. Clonal organisms should be especially endangered when co-occurring with closely related sexual species. In this context, major histocompatibility (MHC) genes have been discussed to be auspicious candidates that could provide the genetic basis on which selection for immune competence could act. In this study, we investigated MHC variability in a clonal teleost fish: the Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa. The Amazon molly is an ideal candidate to test the Red Queen hypothesis as it is a clonal species but co-occurs with a closely related sexual species and should therefore be especially susceptible to pathogen infection. We found that allele numbers did in general not differ between sexual and clonal 'species' but that genotypic variability is reduced in the clonally reproducing fish, especially in the polyploids. We conclude that in clonal organisms, genotype frequency might be more important for immune competence than MHC allele number. Amazon mollies and their co-occurring parental species clearly fulfil a prerequisite of the Red Queen hypothesis and should therefore provide an ideal system to experimentally test this basic principle probably underlying the evolution of sex.

Within parasites, an emergence of host-specific lineages is assumed to create such cryptic variability; however, empirical evaluation of these processes is scarce. Here, we analyse populations of a parasite with a complex life cycle, wide host spectrum and global distribution, with the aim to reveal factors underlying the evolution of host- or geography-dependent lineages. Using 15 microsatellite loci, deep genetic distances were observed between populations from distant geographical areas. On the local scale, host-mediated genetic structure was found among sympatric samples. Two lineages differing in the spectrum of infected hosts co-occurred in the Euro-Mediterranean area, and two distinct lineages were recovered from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Although sampled across several host taxa and multiple localities, a lack of marked genetic structure was seen in the populations belonging to one of the European lineages. Only weak genetic differentiation between sympatric samples from two host species was found. Complexity of the parasite life-cycle contributed to such a stratified pattern. Differences in the immune response between fish hosts were suggested as the factor diversifying the populations locally; conversely, high mobility of the parasite due to migration with its bird (definitive) host were assessed to homogenize populations across the area of distribution. However, despite the high mobility, large bodies of salt water prevent the parasite from long-distance migrations, as was demonstrated in an example of the Mediterranean Sea which represented an effective barrier to gene flow.

TI Multiple introductions of the Spiroplasma bacterial endosymbiont into
   Drosophila
AB Bacterial endosymbionts are common in insects and can have dramatic effects on their host's evolution. So far, the only heritable symbionts found in Drosophila have been Wolbachia and Spiroplasma. While the incidence and effects of Wolbachia have been studied extensively, the prevalence and significance of Spiroplasma infections in Drosophila are less clear. These small, gram-positive, helical bacteria infect a diverse array of plant and arthropod hosts, conferring a variety of fitness effects. Male-killing Spiroplasma are known from certain Drosophila species; however, in others, Spiroplasma appear not to affect sex ratio. Previous studies have identified different Spiroplasma haplotypes in Drosophila populations, although no extensive surveys have yet been reported. We used a multilocus sequence analysis to reconstruct a robust Spiroplasma endosymbiont phylogeny, assess genetic diversity, and look for evidence of recombination. Six loci were sequenced from over 65 Spiroplasma-infected individuals from nine different Drosophila species. Analysis of these sequences reveals at least five separate introductions of four phylogenetically distinct Spiroplasma haplotypes, indicating that more extensive sampling will likely reveal an even greater Spiroplasma endosymbiont diversity. Patterns of variation in Drosophila mitochondrial haplotypes in Spiroplasma-infected and uninfected flies imply imperfect vertical transmission in host populations and possible horizontal transmission.

TI Risk Maps of Lassa Fever in West Africa
AB Background: Lassa fever is caused by a viral haemorrhagic arenavirus that affects two to three million people in West Africa, causing a mortality of between 5,000 and 10,000 each year. The natural reservoir of Lassa virus is the multi-mammate rat Mastomys natalensis, which lives in houses and surrounding fields. With the aim of gaining more information to control this disease, we here carry out a spatial analysis of Lassa fever data from human cases and infected rodent hosts covering the period 1965-2007. Information on contemporary environmental conditions (temperature, rainfall, vegetation) was derived from NASA Terra MODIS satellite sensor data and other sources and for elevation from the GTOPO30 surface for the region from Senegal to the Congo. All multi-temporal data were analysed using temporal Fourier techniques to generate images of means, amplitudes and phases which were used as the predictor variables in the models. In addition, meteorological rainfall data collected between 1951 and 1989 were used to generate a synoptic rainfall surface for the same region.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Three different analyses (models) are presented, one superimposing Lassa fever outbreaks on the mean rainfall surface (Model 1) and the other two using non-linear discriminant analytical techniques. Model 2 selected variables in a step-wise inclusive fashion, and Model 3 used an information-theoretic approach in which many different random combinations of 10 variables were fitted to the Lassa fever data. Three combinations of absence: presence clusters were used in each of Models 2 and 3, the 2 absence: 1 presence cluster combination giving what appeared to be the best result. Model 1 showed that the recorded outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations occurred in zones receiving between 1,500 and 3,000 mm rainfall annually. Rainfall, and to a much lesser extent temperature variables, were most strongly selected in both Models 2 and 3, and neither vegetation nor altitude seemed particularly important. Both Models 2 and 3 produced mean kappa values in excess of 0.91 (Model 2) or 0.86 (Model 3), making them 'Excellent'.
   Conclusion/Significance: The Lassa fever areas predicted by the models cover approximately 80% of each of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 50% of Guinea, 40% of Nigeria, 30% of each of Cote d'Ivoire, Togo and Benin, and 10% of Ghana.

TI Associations between CYP2B6 Polymorphisms and Pharmacokinetics after a
   Single Dose of Nevirapine or Efavirenz in African Americans
AB Background. Polymorphisms in CYP2B6 affect the steady-state plasma concentrations of nevirapine and efavirenz. In many resource-limited countries, a single dose of nevirapine has been widely prescribed to pregnant women at delivery, to reduce mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We characterized associations between genetic polymorphisms and the pharmacokinetics of single doses of nevirapine and efavirenz.
   Methods. Plasma drug concentrations were determined over the 13-day period after administration of a 200-mg oral dose of nevirapine to nonpregnant, HIV-negative African Americans. A 600-mg oral dose of efavirenz was subsequently administered, and pharmacokinetic sampling was repeated. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a noncompartmental approach. Primary analyses involved 2 CYP2B6 polymorphisms (516G -> T and 983T -> C) known to predict increased steady-state plasma nevirapine and efavirenz exposure. Exploratory analyses involved another 51 polymorphisms in CYP2B6, ABCB1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5.
   Results. On the basis of the composite CYP2B6 516/ 983 genotype, the 34 participants comprised 10 extensive, 17 intermediate, and 7 slow metabolizer genotypes. The composite CYP2B6 516/ 983 genotype was significantly associated with plasma drug exposure and clearance for efavirenz but not nevirapine. Exploratory analyses suggested possible associations between additional CYP2B6 polymorphisms and the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine and efavirenz.
   Conclusions. Selective pressure for drug-resistant HIV-1 after administration of single-dose nevirapine may not differ substantially according to CYP2B6 516/ 983 genotype. Additional polymorphisms, genes, and populations warrant further study.

TI Sex-specific variation in the emphasis, inducibility and timing of the
   post-mating immune response in Drosophila melanogaster
AB Ecological immunology attempts to explain variation in immune function. Much of this work makes predictions about how potential hosts should invest in overall immunity. However, this 'overall' perspective under-emphasizes other critical aspects, such as the specificity, inducibility and timing of an immune response. Here, we investigate these aspects by examining gene regulation across several immune system components in both male and female Drosophila melanogaster prior to and after mating. To elucidate potentially important temporal dynamics, we also assayed several genes over time. We found that males and females emphasized different components of their immune system, however overall investment was similar. Specifically, the sexes emphasized different gene paralogues within major gene families, and males tended to invest more in gram-negative defence. By contrast, the inducibility of the immune response was both transient (lasting approx. 24 hours) and equal between the sexes. Furthermore, mating tended to induce humoral gene upregulation, while cell-mediated genes were unaffected. Within the humoral system, gram-negative bacterial defence genes exhibited a greater inducibility than those associated with fungal or gram-positive bacterial defence. Our results suggest that variation in the effectiveness of the immune response between the sexes may be driven by differences in emphasis rather than overall investment.

TI Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) heterozygote superiority to
   natural multi-parasite infections in the water vole (Arvicola
   terrestris)
AB The fundamental role of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in immune recognition has led to a general consensus that the characteristically high levels of functional polymorphism at MHC genes is maintained by balancing selection operating through host-parasite coevolution. However, the actual mechanism by which selection operates is unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed: overdominance (or heterozygote superiority) and negative frequency-dependent selection. Evidence for these hypotheses was evaluated by examining MHC-parasite relationships in an island population of water voles (Arvicola terrestris). Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine whether individual variation at an MHC class II DRB locus explained variation in the individual burdens of five different parasites. MHC genotype explained a significant amount of variation in the burden of gamasid mites, fleas (Megabothris walkeri) and nymphs of sheep ticks (Ixodes ricinus). Additionally, MHC heterozygotes were simultaneously co-infected by fewer parasite types than homozygotes. In each case where an MHC-dependent effect on parasite burden was resolved, the heterozygote genotype was associated with fewer parasites, and the heterozygote outperformed each homozygote in two of three cases, suggesting an overall superiority against parasitism for MHC heterozygote genotypes. This is the first demonstration of MHC heterozygote superiority against multiple parasites in a natural population, a mechanism that could help maintain high levels of functional MHC genetic diversity in natural populations.

TI Comparison of Two Active Surveillance Programs for the Detection of
   Clinical Dengue Cases in Iquitos, Peru
AB Endemic dengue transmission has been documented in the Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru, since the early 1990s. To better understand the epidemiology of dengue transmission in Iquitos, we established multiple active surveillance systems to detect symptomatic infections. Here we compare the efficacy of distinct community-based (door to door) and school absenteeism-based febrile surveillance strategies in detecting active cases of dengue. Febrile episodes were detected by both systems with equal rapidity after disease onset. However, during the period that both programs were running simultaneously in 2004, a higher number of febrile cases in general (4.52/1.00 versus 1.64/100 person-years) and dengue cases specifically (2.35/100 versus 1.29/100 person-years) were detected in school-aged children through the community-based surveillance program. Similar results were obtained by direct comparison of 435 participants concurrently enrolled in both programs (P < 0.005). We conclude that, in Iquitos, community-based door-to-door surveillance is a more efficient and sensitive design for detecting active dengue cases than programs based on school absenteeism.

A total of 1,639 rodents were trapped at 86 randomly selected sites. The overall infection rate for hantavirus was 7.14% in the rodents. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the natural infection rates for hantavirus in rodents were significantly associated with rice agriculture (odds ratio [OR] = 2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-30.70). orchards (OR = 1.12 95% CI = 1.02-5.96), and moderate elevation (OR = 9.83, 95% CI = 2.22-43.55). A risk map was constructed on the basis of these significant factors to predict extension and transmission of infection with hantavirus in this region.

TI Evolution of Acute Infections and the Invasion-Persistence Trade-Off
AB We seek to understand the conditions favoring the evolution of acute, highly transmissible infections. Most work on the life-history evolution of pathogens has focused on the transmission-virulence trade-off. Here we focus on a distinct trade-off that operates, even among avirulent pathogens, between a pathogen's speed of invasion and its ability to persist in a finite host population. Other authors have shown how this invasion-persistence trade-off can lead to intermediate pathogen attack rates but have done so only by imposing trade-offs between the pathogen's transmissibility and the duration of the infectious period. Here we delve deeper, by linking a model of within-host pathogen dynamics-in which pathogen life-history parameters figure directly-to an epidemiological model at the population level. We find that a key determinant of the evolutionary trajectory is the shape of the dose-response curve that relates within-host pathogen load to between-host transmission. In particular, under the usual assumption of proportionality we find that pathogens tend to evolve to the edge of their own extinction. Under more realistic assumptions, a critical host population size exists, above which highly acute pathogens are buffered from extinction. Our study is motivated by the emergence of acuteness in two human pathogens, Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis, which independently evolved from an ancestor, Bordetella bronchiseptica, characterized by chronic (nonacute) infection of wildlife. In contrast to the plethora of models that predict evolution of more aggressive pathogens in larger or denser populations, the invasion-persistence trade-off also operates for frequency-dependent pathogens.

TI Long-Distance Dispersal and Accelerating Waves of Disease: Empirical
   Relationships
AB Classic approaches to modeling biological invasions predict a "traveling wave" of constant velocity determined by the invading organism's reproductive capacity, generation time, and dispersal ability. Traveling wave models may not apply, however, for organisms that exhibit long-distance dispersal. Here we use simple empirical relationships for accelerating waves, based on inverse power law dispersal, and apply them to diseases caused by pathogens that are wind dispersed or vectored by birds: the within-season spread of a plant disease at spatial scales of <100 m in experimental plots, historical plant disease epidemics at the continental scale, the unexpectedly rapid spread of West Nile virus across North America, and the transcontinental spread of avian influenza strain H5N1 in Eurasia and Africa. In all cases, the position of the epidemic front advanced exponentially with time, and epidemic velocity increased linearly with distance; regression slopes varied over a relatively narrow range among data sets. Estimates of the inverse power law exponent for dispersal that would be required to attain the rates of disease spread observed in the field also varied relatively little (1.74-2.36), despite more than a fivefold range of spatial scale among the data sets.

TI Home Range and Parasite Diversity in Mammals
AB Parasite diversity among and within host species is not solely the result of random processes; rather, it depends on a suite of physiological or ecological host traits as well as environmental factors. Because most macroparasites exhibit life cycles that include infective stages off the definitive host and that rely on host movements for dissemination, parasite acquisition by a host depends largely on hosts being present in a given area where and when infective stages are present. Consequently, host ranging pattern may have a major influence on parasite diversity. Larger home range size is hypothesized to be associated with higher parasite species richness because hosts living in large home ranges should encounter a greater diversity of habitats and other host individuals, which in turn may favor infection by a great diversity of parasite species. By focusing on helminths in wild mammals, we show that an increase in home range area does not lead to an increase in parasite diversity in ungulates and, moreover, that it is associated with a decrease in parasite species richness in carnivores and in glires (rodents and lagomorphs). We also show that home range size is negatively correlated with host density in mammals after correcting both variables for host body mass. We discuss these results from an epidemiological perspective.

TI Space, Time, and Host Evolution Facilitate Coexistence of Competing
   Bacteriophages: Theory and Experiment
AB We present a joint experimental/theoretical investigation into the roles of spatial structure and time in the competition between two pathogens for a single host. We suggest a natural mechanism by which competing pathogens can coexist when host evolution and competitive dynamics occur on similar timescales. Our experimental system consisted of a single bacterial host species and two competing bacteriophage strains grown on agar plates, with a serial transfer of samples of the bacteriophage population to fresh host populations after each incubation cycle. The experiments included two incubation times and two transfer protocols that either maintained or disrupted the spatial structure of the viruses at each transfer. The same bacteriophage acted as the dominant competitor under both transfer protocols. A striking difference between the treatments is that the weak competitor was able to persist in the long-incubation experiments but not in the short-incubation experiments. Mathematical and experimental evidence suggest that coexistence is due to the appearance of resistant mutant host cells that provide a transient "spatiotemporal refuge" for the weaker competitor. Our mathematical model is individual based, captures the stochastic spatial dynamics down to the level of individual cells, and helps to explain the differences in behavior under the various experimental conditions.

TI Impacts of Climate Change on Indirect Human Exposure to Pathogens and
   Chemicals from Agriculture
AB OBJECTIVE: Climate change is likely to affect the nature of pathogens and chemicals in the environment and their fate and transport. Future risks of pathogens and chemicals could therefore be very different from those of today. In this review, we assess the implications of climate change for changes in human exposures to pathogens and chemicals in agricultural systems in the United Kingdom and discuss the subsequent effects on health impacts.
   DATA SOURCES: In this review, we used expert input and considered literature on climate change; health effects resulting from exposure to pathogens and chemicals arising from agriculture; inputs of chemicals and pathogens to agricultural systems; and human exposure pathways for pathogens and chemicals in agricultural systems.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: We established the current evidence base for health effects of chemicals and pathogens in the agricultural environment; determined the potential implications of climate change on chemical and pathogen inputs in agricultural systems; and explored the effects of climate change on environmental transport and fate of different contaminant types. We combined these data to assess the implications of climate change in terms of indirect human exposure to pathogens and chemicals in agricultural systems. We then developed recommendations on future research and policy changes to manage any adverse increases in risks.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, climate change is likely to increase human exposures to agricultural contaminants. The magnitude of the increases will be highly dependent on the contaminant type. Risks from many pathogens and particulate and particle-associated contaminants could increase significantly. These increases in exposure can, however, be managed for the most part through targeted research and policy changes.

   catarrhalis
AB We report an objective examination of nosocomial transmission events derived from long-term (10-year) data from a single medical centre. Cluster analysis, based on the temporal proximity of genetically identical isolates of the respiratory pathogen Moraxella catarrhalis, identified 40 transmission events involving 33 of the 52 genotypes represented by multiple isolates. There was no evidence of highly transmissible or outbreak-prone genotypes. Although most clusters were small (mean size 3.6 isolates) and of short duration (median duration 25 days), clustering accounted for 38.7% of all isolates. Significant risk factors for clustering were multi-bed wards, and winter and spring season, but bacterial antibiotic resistance, manifested as the ability to produce a beta-lactamase was not a risk factor. The use of cluster analysis to identify transmission events and its application to long-term data demonstrate an approach to pathogen transmission that should find wide application beyond hospital populations.

TI EVOLUTIONARY EPIDEMIOLOGY AND THE DYNAMICS OF ADAPTATION
AB The mean fitness of a population, often equal to its growth rate, measures its level of adaptation to particular environmental conditions. A better understanding of the evolution of mean fitness could thus provide a natural link between evolution and demography. Yet, after the seminal work of Fisher and its renowned "fundamental theorem of natural selection," the dynamics of mean fitness has attracted little attention, and mostly from theoretical population geneticists. Here we analyze the dynamics of mean fitness in the context of host-parasite interactions. We illustrate the potential relevance of this analysis under different scenarios ranging from a simple situation in which a parasite evolves in a homogeneous host population to a more complex one with host-parasite coevolution. In each case, we contrast the effects of natural selection, recurrent mutations, and the change of the biotic environment, on the dynamics of adaptation. Decoupling these three components helps elucidate the interplay between evolutionary and ecological dynamics. In particular, it offers new perspectives on situations leading to evolutionary suicide. As mean fitness is an easily measurable quantity in microbial systems, this analysis provides new ways to track the dynamics of adaptation in experimental evolution and coevolution studies.

TI Disease, predation and demography: assessing the impacts of bovine
   tuberculosis on African buffalo by monitoring at individual and
   population levels
AB Understanding the effects of disease is critical to determining appropriate management responses, but estimating those effects in wildlife species is challenging. We used bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in the African buffalo Syncerus caffer population of Kruger National Park, South Africa, as a case study to highlight the issues associated with estimating chronic disease effects in a long-lived host.
   We used known and radiocollared buffalo, aerial census data, and a natural gradient in pathogen prevalence to investigate if: (i) at the individual level, BTB infection reduces reproduction; (ii) BTB infection increases vulnerability to predation; and (iii) at the population level, increased BTB prevalence causes reduced population growth.
   There was only a marginal reduction in calving success associated with BTB infection, as indexed by the probability of sighting a known adult female with or without a calf (P = 0.065).
   Since 1991, BTB prevalence increased from 27 to 45% in the southern region and from 4 to 28% in the central region of Kruger National Park. The prevalence in the northern regions was only 1.5% in 1998. Buffalo population growth rates, however, were neither statistically different among regions nor declining over time.
   Lions Panthera leo did not appear to preferentially kill test-positive buffalo. The best (Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample size) AICc model with BTB as a covariate [exp(beta) = 0.49; 95% CI = (0.24-1.02)] suggested that the mortality hazard for positive individuals was no greater than for test-negative individuals.
   Synthesis and applications. Test accuracy, time-varying disease status, and movement among populations are some of the issues that make the detection of chronic disease impacts challenging. For these reasons, the demographic impacts of bovine tuberculosis in the Kruger National Park remain undetectable despite 6 years of study on known individuals and 40 years of population counts. However, the rainfall and forage conditions during this study were relatively good and the impacts of many chronic diseases may be a non-linear function of environmental conditions such that they are only detectable in stressful periods.

TI Wildlife-livestock conflict: the risk of pathogen transmission from
   bison to cattle outside Yellowstone National Park
AB Interactions between wildlife and domestic livestock have created conflict for centuries because of pathogen transmission, competition for space and food, and predation. However, the transmission of pathogens from wildlife to domestic animals has recently gained prominence, including H5N1 avian influenza from wild ducks to poultry, bovine tuberculosis from badgers to cattle, and brucellosis from elk and bison to cattle. The risk of transmission of Brucella abortus (the causative agent of brucellosis) from bison (Bison bison) to cattle around Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is a hotly debated topic and an important conservation issue.
   Here we use a model to integrate epidemiological and ecological data to assess the spatio-temporal relative risk of transmission of Brucella from bison to cattle outside YNP under different scenarios.
   Our risk assessment shows that relative risk is spatially and temporally heterogeneous with local hotspots, shows a highly skewed distribution with predominantly low risk, and is strongly dependent on climate and the abundance of bison. We outline two strategies for managing this risk, and highlight the consequences of the current adaptive management plan.
   Synthesis and applications. Our results provide a detailed quantitative assessment of risk that offers several advantages over projections of numbers of bison leaving Yellowstone National Park. They suggest that risk could be effectively managed with lower costs, but that land use issues and the larger question of bison population management and movement outside the park might hinder the prospect of solutions that will please all stakeholders. More broadly, our work provides a model framework for quantifying the risk of wildlife-livestock pathogen transmission to guide management actions.

TI Hybrid sterility and inviability in the parasitic fungal species complex
   Microbotryum
AB Microbotryum violaceum, the anther-smut fungus, forms a complex of sibling species which specialize on different plants. Previous studies have shown the presence of partial ecological isolation and F1 inviability, but did not detect assortative mating apart from a high selfing rate. We investigated other post-mating barriers and show that F1 hybrid sterility, the inability of gametes to mate, increased gradually with the increasing genetic distance between the parents. F2 hybrids showed a reduced ability to infect the plants that was also correlated with the genetic distance. The host on which the F2 hybrids were passaged caused a selection for alleles derived from the pathogen species originally isolated from that host, but this effect was not detectable for the most closely related species. The post-mating barriers thus remain weak among the closest species pairs, suggesting that premating barriers are sufficient to initiate divergence in this system.

TI Differences in parasite susceptibility and costs of resistance between
   naturally exposed and unexposed host populations
AB It is generally assumed that resistance to parasitism entails costs. Consequently, hosts evolving in the absence of parasites are predicted to invest less in costly resistance mechanisms than hosts consistently exposed to parasites. This prediction has, however, rarely been tested in natural populations. We studied the susceptibility of three naive, three parasitized and one recently isolated Asellus aquaticus isopod populations to an acanthocephalan parasite. We found that parasitized populations, with the exception of the isopod population sympatric with the parasite strain used, were less susceptible to the parasite than the naive populations. Exposed but uninfected (resistant) isopods from naive populations, but not from parasitized populations, exhibited greater mortality than controls, implying that resistance entails survival costs primarily for naive isopods. These results suggest that parasites can drive the evolution of host resistance in the wild, and that co-existence with parasites may increase the cost-effectiveness of defence mechanisms.

TI Diversifying selection on MHC class I in the house sparrow (Passer
   domesticus)
AB Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most polymorphic loci known in vertebrates. Two main hypotheses have been put forward to explain the maintenance of MHC diversity: pathogen-mediated selection and MHC-based mate choice. Host-parasite interactions can maintain MHC diversity via frequency-dependent selection, heterozygote advantage, and diversifying selection (spatially and/or temporally heterogeneous selection). In this study, we wished to investigate the nature of selection acting on the MHC class I across spatially structured populations of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in France. To infer the nature of the selection, we compared patterns of population differentiation based on two types of molecular markers: MHC class I and microsatellites. This allowed us to test whether the observed differentiation at MHC genes merely reflects demographic and/or stochastic processes. At the global scale, diversifying selection seems to be the main factor maintaining MHC diversity in the house sparrow. We found that (i) overall population differentiation at MHC was stronger than for microsatellites, (ii) MHC marker showed significant isolation by distance. In addition, the slope of the regression of F(ST) on geographical distance was significantly steeper for MHC than for microsatellites due to a stronger pairwise differentiation between populations located at large geographical distances. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that spatially heterogeneous selective pressures maintain different MHC alleles at local scales, possibly resulting in local adaptation.

TI The Role of Environmental Transmission in Recurrent Avian Influenza
   Epidemics
AB Avian influenza virus (AIV) persists in North American wild waterfowl, exhibiting major outbreaks every 2-4 years. Attempts to explain the patterns of periodicity and persistence using simple direct transmission models are unsuccessful. Motivated by empirical evidence, we examine the contribution of an overlooked AIV transmission mode: environmental transmission. It is known that infectious birds shed large concentrations of virions in the environment, where virions may persist for a long time. We thus propose that, in addition to direct fecal/oral transmission, birds may become infected by ingesting virions that have long persisted in the environment. We design a new host-pathogen model that combines within-season transmission dynamics, between-season migration and reproduction, and environmental variation. Analysis of the model yields three major results. First, environmental transmission provides a persistence mechanism within small communities where epidemics cannot be sustained by direct transmission only (i.e., communities smaller than the critical community size). Second, environmental transmission offers a parsimonious explanation of the 2-4 year periodicity of avian influenza epidemics. Third, very low levels of environmental transmission (i.e., few cases per year) are sufficient for avian influenza to persist in populations where it would otherwise vanish.

TI Evolutionary Epidemiology of Drug-Resistance in Space
AB How can we optimize the use of drugs against parasites to limit the evolution of drug resistance? This question has been addressed by many theoretical studies focusing either on the mixing of various treatments, or their temporal alternation. Here we consider a different treatment strategy where the use of the drug may vary in space to prevent the rise of drug-resistance. We analyze epidemiological models where drug-resistant and drug-sensitive parasites compete in a one-dimensional spatially heterogeneous environment. Two different parasite life-cycles are considered: (i) direct transmission between hosts, and (ii) vector-borne transmission. In both cases we find a critical size of the treated area, under which the drug-resistant strain cannot persist. This critical size depends on the basic reproductive ratios of each strain in each environment, on the ranges of dispersal, and on the duration of an infection with drug-resistant parasites. We discuss optimal treatment strategies that limit disease prevalence and the evolution of drug-resistance.

TI Estimating the Location and Spatial Extent of a Covert Anthrax Release
AB Rapidly identifying the features of a covert release of an agent such as anthrax could help to inform the planning of public health mitigation strategies. Previous studies have sought to estimate the time and size of a bioterror attack based on the symptomatic onset dates of early cases. We extend the scope of these methods by proposing a method for characterizing the time, strength, and also the location of an aerosolized pathogen release. A back-calculation method is developed allowing the characterization of the release based on the data on the first few observed cases of the subsequent outbreak, meteorological data, population densities, and data on population travel patterns. We evaluate this method on small simulated anthrax outbreaks (about 25-35 cases) and show that it could date and localize a release after a few cases have been observed, although misspecifications of the spore dispersion model, or the within-host dynamics model, on which the method relies can bias the estimates. Our method could also provide an estimate of the outbreak's geographical extent and, as a consequence, could help to identify populations at risk and, therefore, requiring prophylactic treatment. Our analysis demonstrates that while estimates based on the first ten or 15 observed cases were more accurate and less sensitive to model misspecifications than those based on five cases, overall mortality is minimized by targeting prophylactic treatment early on the basis of estimates made using data on the first five cases. The method we propose could provide early estimates of the time, strength, and location of an aerosolized anthrax release and the geographical extent of the subsequent outbreak. In addition, estimates of release features could be used to parameterize more detailed models allowing the simulation of control strategies and intervention logistics.

The establishment of symbiosis required an intimate metabolic link between biological systems with different complexity levels. The strict endocellular symbiotic bacteria of insects are beautiful examples of the metabolic coupling between organisms belonging to different kingdoms, a eukaryote and a prokaryote. The host (eukaryote) provides the endosymbiont (prokaryote) with a stable cellular environment while the endosymbiont supplements the host's diet with essential metabolites. For such communication to take place, endosymbionts' genomes have suffered dramatic modifications and reconfigurations of proteins' functions. Two of the main modifications, loss of genes redundant for endosymbiotic bacteria or the host and bacterial genome streamlining, have been extensively studied. However, no studies have accounted for possible functional shifts in the endosymbiotic proteomes. Here, we develop a simple method to screen genomes for evidence of functional divergence between two species clusters, and we apply it to identify functional shifts in the endosymbiotic proteomes. Despite the strong effects of genetic drift in the endosymbiotic systems, we unexpectedly identified genes to be under stronger selective constraints in endosymbionts of aphids and ants than in their free-living bacterial relatives. These genes are directly involved in supplementing the host's diet with essential metabolites. A test of functional divergence supports a strong relationship between the endosymbiosis and the functional shifts of proteins involved in the metabolic communication with the insect host. The correlation between functional divergence in the endosymbiotic bacterium and the ecological requirements of the host uncovers their intimate biochemical and metabolic communication and provides insights on the role of symbiosis in generating species diversity.

TI Use of Mapping and Spatial and Space-Time Modeling Approaches in
   Operational Control of Aedes aegypti and Dengue
AB The aims of this review paper are to 1) provide an overview of how mapping and spatial and space-time modeling approaches have been used to date to visualize and analyze mosquito vector and epidemiologic data for dengue; and 2) discuss the potential for these approaches to be included as routine activities in operational vector and dengue control programs. Geographical information system (GIS) software are becoming more user-friendly and now are complemented by free mapping software that provide access to satellite imagery and basic featuremaking tools and have the capacity to generate static maps as well as dynamic time-series maps. Our challenge is now to move beyond the research arena by transferring mapping and GIS technologies and spatial statistical analysis techniques in user-friendly packages to operational vector and dengue control programs. This will enable control programs to, for example, generate risk maps for exposure to dengue virus, develop Priority Area Classifications for vector control, and socioeconomic associations with dengue risk.

TI Gene Flow, Subspecies Composition, and Dengue Virus-2 Susceptibility
   among Aedes aegypti Collections in Senegal
AB Background: Aedes aegypti, the "yellow fever mosquito'', is the primary vector to humans of the four serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV1-4) and yellow fever virus (YFV) and is a known vector of Chikungunya virus. There are two recognized subspecies of Ae. aegypti sensu latu (s.l.): the presumed ancestral form, Ae. aegypti formosus (Aaf), a primarily sylvan mosquito in sub-Saharan Africa, and Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaf), found globally in tropical and subtropical regions typically in association with humans. The designation of Ae. aegypti s.l. subspecies arose from observations made in East Africa in the late 1950s that the frequency of pale "forms'' of Ae. aegypti was higher in populations in and around human dwellings than in those of the nearby bush. But few studies have been made of Ae. aegypti s.l. in West Africa. To address this deficiency we have been studying the population genetics, subspecies composition and vector competence for DENV-2 of Ae. aegypti s.l. in Senegal.
   Methods and Findings: A population genetic analysis of gene flow was conducted among 1,040 Aedes aegypti s.l. from 19 collections distributed across the five phytogeographic regions of Senegal. Adults lacking pale scales on their first abdominal tergite were classified as Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf) following the original description of the subspecies and the remainder were classified as Aedes aegypti aegypti (Aaa). There was a clear northwest-southeast cline in the abundance of Aaa and Aaf. Collections from the northern Sahelian region contained only Aaa while southern Forest gallery collections contained only Aaf. The two subspecies occurred in sympatry in four collections north of the Gambia in the central Savannah region and Aaa was a minor component of two collections from the Forest gallery area. Mosquitoes from 11 collections were orally challenged with DENV-2 virus. In agreement with the early literature, Aaf had significantly lower vector competence than Aaa. Among pure Aaa collections, the disseminated infection rate (DIR) was 73.9% with a midgut infection barrier (MIB) rate of 6.8%, and a midgut escape barrier (MEB) rate of 19.3%, while among pure Aaf collections, DIR = 34.2%, MIB rate = 7.4%, and MEB rate = 58.4%. Allele and genotype frequencies were analyzed at 11 nuclear single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci using allele specific PCR and melting curve analysis. In agreement with a published isozyme gene flow study in Senegal, only a small and statistically insignificant percentage of the variance in allele frequencies was associated with subspecies.
   Conclusions: These results add to our understanding of the global phylogeny of Aedes aegypti s.l., suggesting that West African Aaa and Aaf are monophyletic and that Aaa evolved in West Africa from an Aaf ancestor.

TI Association between Habitat and Prevalence of Hantavirus Infections in
   Bank Voles (Myodes glareolus) and Wood Mice (Apodemus sylvaticus)
AB In order to determine the habitat preferred by Myodes (before Clethrionomys) glareolus and the corresponding Puumala hantavirus seroprevalence in those habitats, we captured rodents simultaneously in three significantly different habitats. We compared trapping success and presence of virus per habitat during an ongoing epidemic in order to test the hypothesis of a density-dependent seroprevalence. Our study showed that bank vole population density, as well as Puumala virus seroprevalence, were habitat dependent. Apodemus sylvaticus was found more vulnerable for deteriorating habitat conditions than M. glareolus and could play a role as vehicle for Puumala virus and as mediator for inter- and conspecific virus transmission.

TI Detection and Monitoring of Mosquito Flaviviruses in Spain between 2001
   and 2005
AB Between the years 2001 and 2005, a total of 72,895 female mosquitoes were trapped during their season of abundance, and analyzed. They were sorted into 4,723 pools belonging to 20 Culicidae species from the Anopheles, Aedes, Ochlerotatus, Culex, Culiseta, Coquillettidia, and Uranotaenia genera. The aim was to detect arboviral RNA directly from mosquito homogenates for the genera Alphavirus, Flavivirus, and Phlebovirus. The study formed part of general arbovirus transmission research in four of the most important wetlands in Spain; in the provinces of Girona, Barcelona, Tarragona, and Huelva. The mosquitoes were collected using human bait, CO(2) traps, or light traps, and they were pooled according to date of collection, location, and species. No arboviral RNA from known pathogenic arboviruses was found. However, 111 pools tested positive for unknown mosquito Flavivirus, the only genus detected. The Flavivirus sequences identified were different from all known Flavivirus mosquito viruses, but very close to Kamiti River virus or cell fusing agent virus. The maximum likelihood estimation infection rate (MLE) was calculated for all regions and species. Aedes albopictus had the highest MLE at 47.14, followed by Ae. vexans with 43.67 (over the entire area). These species were followed by Culiseta annulata, with 36.00. The most common species, Ochlerotatus caspius and Culex pipiens, had low MLE values-0.94 and 0.38, respectively-over the area as a whole.

TI Anaplasma phagocytophilum groEL Gene Heterogeneity in Ixodes ricinus
   Larvae Feeding on Roe Deer in Northeastern Italy
AB Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an emerging tick-borne pathogen with both veterinary and human health implications. The role of wildlife hosts for this pathogen are not well defined, even thought roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) has been suggested to contribute to the occurrence of this tick-borne diseases in Europe. Therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of this ungulate species as a reservoir of human pathogenic strains of A. phagocytophilum in a tick-borne diseases endemic area in Northeastern Italy. Ixodes ricinus feeding on roe deer were collected and analyzed for the presence for A. phagocytophilum by a molecular approach targeting 16S rRNA and groEL genes. The mean prevalence of A. phagocytophilum recorded was 5.11%, highlighting the ability of roe deer to infect the I. ricinus larval stage. The results of further genetic characterization of the strains of A. phagocytophilum herein isolated, based on phylogenetic information contained in groEL gene sequences, showed substantial heterogeneity among sequences analyzed. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that the roe deer population of the Trentino region of Italy harbors strains of A. phagocytophilum of unknown pathogenicity for humans.

TI The causes of mutation accumulation in mitochondrial genomes
AB A fundamental observation across eukaryotic taxa is that mitochondrial genomes have a higher load of deleterious mutations than nuclear genomes. Identifying the evolutionary forces that drive this difference is important to understanding the rates and patterns of sequence evolution, the efficacy of natural selection, the maintenance of sex and recombination and the mechanisms underlying human ageing and many diseases. Recent studies have implicated the presumed asexuality of mitochondrial genomes as responsible for their high mutational load. We review the current body of knowledge on mitochondrial mutation accumulation and recombination, and conclude that asexuality, per se, may not be the primary determinant of the high mutation load in mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA). Very little recombination is required to counter mutation accumulation, and recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial genomes do experience occasional recombination. Instead, a high rate of accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in mtDNA may result from the small effective population size associated with effectively haploid inheritance. This type of transmission is nearly ubiquitous among mitochondrial genomes. We also describe an experimental framework using variation in mating system between closely related species to disentangle the root causes of mutation accumulation in mitochondrial genomes.

TI Contact heterogeneity in deer mice: implications for Sin Nombre virus
   transmission
AB Heterogeneities within disease hosts suggest that not all individuals have the same probability of transmitting disease or becoming infected. This heterogeneity is thought to be due to dissimilarity in susceptibility and exposure among hosts. As such, it has been proposed that many host-pathogen systems follow the general pattern whereby a small fraction of the population accounts for a large fraction of the pathogen transmission. This disparity in transmission dynamics is often referred to as '20/80 Rule', i.e. approximately 20 per cent of the hosts are responsible for 80 per cent of pathogen transmission. We investigated the role of heterogeneity in contact rates among potential hosts of a directly transmitted pathogen by examining Sin Nombre virus (SNV) in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using foraging arenas and powder marking, we documented contacts between wild deer mice in Great Basin Desert, central Utah. Our findings demonstrated heterogeneity among deer mice, both in frequency and in duration of contacts with other deer mice. Contact dynamics appear to follow the general pattern that a minority of the population accounts for a majority of the contacts. We found that 20 per cent of individuals in the population were responsible for roughly 80 per cent of the contacts observed. Larger-bodied individuals appear to be the functional group with the greatest SNV transmission potential. Contrary to our predictions, transmission potential was not influenced by breeding condition or sex.

TI Mode of transmission and the evolution of arbovirus virulence in
   mosquito vectors
AB The traditional assumption that vector-borne pathogens should evolve towards a benign relationship with their arthropod vectors has been challenged on theoretical grounds and empirical evidence. However, in the case of arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses), although a number of investigators have reported experimental evidence for virus-induced vector mortality, others have failed to detect any significant impact. Whether this variation in the observed level of arbovirus virulence depends on biological traits or experimental design is unclear. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of studies across a range of mosquito virus systems to show that, overall, arboviruses do reduce the survival of their mosquito vectors, but that the magnitude of the effect depends on the vector/virus taxonomic groups and the mode of virus transmission. Alphaviruses were associated with highest virulence levels in mosquitoes. Horizontal transmission (intrathoracic inoculation or oral infection) was correlated with significant virus-induced mortality, whereas a lack of adverse effect was found for Aedes mosquitoes infected transovarially by bunyaviruses-a group of viruses characterized by high natural rates of vertical transmission in their enzootic vectors. Our findings are consistent with the general prediction that vertically transmitted pathogens should be less virulent than those transmitted horizontally. We conclude that varying degrees of virulence observed among vector-virus systems probably reflect different selective pressures imposed on arboviruses that are primarily transmitted horizontally versus vertically.

TI Strong Correlations of Anti-Viral Capsid Antigen Antibody Levels in
   First-Degree Relatives from Families with Epstein-Barr Virus-Related
   Lymphomas
AB Background. Markers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection include anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin (Ig) G. High anti-VCA titers are associated with EBV-related lymphoproliferation, such as Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).
   Methods. Intrafamilial correlations of anti-VCA IgG levels were studied in 3 settings: 127 families recruited through patients with HL in France (population A), 31 families recruited through patients with BL in Uganda (population B), and 74 large families from a general population in Cameroon (population C). Titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (populations A and C) or by immunofluorescence analysis (population B).
   Results. In populations A and B, the anti-VCA IgG titers of the relatives of patients with HL or BL increased significantly (P = .01 and P < .001, respectively) with those of the index case patient. In all 3 populations, anti-VCA IgG titers were significantly correlated (P < .001 for A, P < .002 for B, and P < .001 for C) between genetically related individuals (father-offspring, mother-offspring, and sibling-sibling) but not between spouses. Similar results were obtained for population A after adjustment for total IgG levels. In all cases, the pattern of correlations was consistent with a polygenic model, with heritability ranging from 0.32 to 0.48.
   Conclusion. These results provide evidence for the genetic control of anti-VCA IgG titers and pave the way for identification of the loci involved.

TI Genotype of 88 Toxoplasma gondii Isolates Associated with Toxoplasmosis
   in Immunocompromised Patients and Correlation with Clinical Findings
AB We report the genotyping analysis of Toxoplasma gondii isolates in samples collected from 88 immunocompromised patients, along with clinical and epidemiological data. Most of these samples were collected in France during the current decade by the Toxoplasma Biological Resource Center. Lack of specific anti-Toxoplasma treatment, pulmonary toxoplasmosis, and involvement of multiple organs were the 3 main risk factors associated with death for this patient group. Genotyping results with 6 microsatellite markers showed that type II isolates were predominant among patients who acquired toxoplasmic infection in Europe. Non-type II isolates included 13 different genotypes and were mainly collected from patients who acquired toxoplasmosis outside Europe. Type III was the second most common genotype recovered from patients, whereas type I was rare in our population. Three nonarchetypal genotypes were repeatedly recovered from different patients who acquired the infection in sub-Saharan Africa (genotypes Africa 1 and Africa 2) and in the French West Indies (genotype Caribbean 1). The distribution of genotypes (type II vs. non-type II) was not significantly different when patients were stratified by underlying cause of immunosuppression, site of infection, or outcome. We conclude that in immunocompromised patients, host factors are much more involved than parasite factors in patients' resistance or susceptibility to toxoplasmosis.

TI The effect of sterilizing diseases on host abundance and distribution
   along environmental gradients
AB This study analyses the effect of host-specific pathogens on range restriction of their hosts across environmental gradients at population margins. Sterilizing diseases can limit host range by causing large reductions in population size in what would otherwise be the central area of a species range. Diseases showing frequency-dependent transmission can also pull back a population from its disease-free margin. A wide range of disease prevalence versus abundance patterns emerge which often differ from the classical expectation of increasing prevalence with increasing abundance. Surprisingly, very few empirical studies have investigated the dynamics of disease across environmental gradients or at range limits.

TI Prevalence of Antibodies to Japanese Encephalitis Virus among
   Inhabitants in Java Island, Indonesia, with a Small Pig Population
AB Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is maintained through a transmission cycle between amplifier swine and vector mosquitoes in a peridomestic environment. Thus, studies on natural JEV activities in an environment with a small size of pig population have been limited. Here, we surveyed antibodies against JEV in inhabitants of Jakarta and Surabaya located in Java Island (Indonesia), which has a small swine population. Overall, 2.2% of 1,211 sera collected in Jakarta and 1.8% of 1,751 sera collected in Surabaya had neutralizing antibody titers of >= 1:160 (90% plaque reduction). All the samples with titers of : 1:160 against JEV were also examined for neutralizing antibodies against each of four dengue viruses to confirm that JEV antibody prevalences obtained in the present survey were not attributable to serologic cross-reactivities among flaviviruses distributed in Java. These results indicated that people in Java Island are exposed to natural JEV infections despite a small swine population.

TI Source Populations Act as Coevolutionary Pacemakers in Experimental
   Selection Mosaics Containing Hotspots and Coldspots
AB Natural populations of hosts and their enemies are often spatially structured, with patches that vary in the strength of reciprocal selection, so-called coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots with strong or weak reciprocal selection, respectively. Theory predicts that dispersal from hotspots should intensify coevolution in coldspots, whereas dispersal from coldspots should weaken coevolution in hotspots; however, there have been few empirical tests. We addressed this using paired populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the phage SBW25 Phi 2 linked by one-way dispersal. Within each population, the strength of reciprocal selection was manipulated by altering the bacteria-phage encounter rate, which changes the rate of coevolution without affecting environmental productivity. We observed that dispersal from hotspots accelerated coevolution in coldspots, while dispersal from coldspots decelerated coevolution in hotspots. These results confirm theoretical predictions and suggest that source populations can act as coevolutionary "pacemakers" for recipient populations, overriding local conditions.

TI Locally adapted social parasite affects density, social structure, and
   life history of its ant hosts
AB Selection and adaptation are important processes in the coevolution between parasites and their hosts. The slave-making ant Protomognathus americanus, an obligate ant social parasite, has previously been shown to evolve morphological, behavioral, and chemical adaptations in the coevolutionary arms race with its Temnothorax hosts. Yet empirical studies have given variable results on the strength of the selection pressure this parasite exerts on its host populations. In this study, we directly investigated the pressure exerted by P. americanus and the reactions of the main host species, T. longispinosus, in two ant communities by manipulating parasite density in the field over several years. In addition, a cross-fostering design with the exchange of parasites between host populations allowed us to investigate local adaptation of parasite or host. We demonstrate a severe impact of the social parasite on the two host populations in West Virginia and New York, but also variation in host reactions between sites, as expected by the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. Host density decreased at the West Virginia site with the presence of local slave-makers, whereas at the ecologically favorable New York site, density was unaffected. Nevertheless, social organization, colony size, and investment patterns of these host colonies at this site changed in response to our parasite manipulation. The release of P. americanus colonies led to a reduction in the number of resident queens and workers, an increase in intranest relatedness, and lower productivity, but also a higher investment in reproductives. In West Virginia, colony demography did not change, but raiding activity by New York slave-makers caused different investment patterns of host colonies. In addition, the cross-fostering element revealed local adaptation of the parasite P. americanus: slave-making colonies fared better in their sympatric host population, as they contained more slave-making ant workers and slaves at the end of our 27-month experiment.

TI Inter- and intra-specific exposure to parasites and pathogens via the
   faecal-oral route: a consequence of behaviour in a patchy environment
AB Livestock herbivores are at risk of inter- and intra-specific exposure to parasites/pathogens via the faecal-oral route during grazing. Each contact between livestock and faeces in the environment is a potential parasite/pathogen transmission event. Cattle grazing contact with faeces varies in relation to the species depositing the faeces and the distribution of the faeces. We used a foraging model to simulate the grazing behaviour of beef cattle in two grazing systems to compare the relative inter-specific and intra-specific exposure risks to parasites/pathogens. Overall, there is a greater level of intra- vs. inter-specific risk via the faecal-oral route. However, under certain conditions, particularly for microparasite infections, e.g. paratuberculosis in rabbits and bovine tuberculosis in badgers, wildlife may pose a significant exposure risk to parasites/pathogens. These risks can be enhanced when cattle are first turned out onto pasture and in situations where intra-specific variations in wildlife behaviour result in more dispersed defecation patterns.

TI GROUP SELECTION ON POPULATION SIZE AFFECTS LIFE-HISTORY PATTERNS IN THE
   ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODE STEINERNEMA CARPOCAPSAE
AB Selection is recognized to operate on multiple levels. In disease organisms, selection among hosts is thought to provide an important counterbalance to selection for faster growth within hosts. We performed three experiments, each selecting for a divergence in group size in the entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae. These nematodes infect and kill insect larvae, reproduce inside the host carcass, and emerge as infective juveniles. We imposed selection on group size by selecting among hosts for either high or low numbers of emerging nematodes. Our goal was to determine whether this trait could respond to selection at the group level, and if so, to examine what other traits would evolve as correlated responses. One of the three experiments showed a significant response to group selection. In that experiment, the high-selected treatment consistently produced more emerging nematodes per host than the low-selected treatment. In addition, nematodes were larger and they emerged later from hosts in the low-selected lines. Despite small effective population sizes, the effects of inbreeding were small in this experiment. Thus, selection among hosts can be effective, leading to both a direct evolutionary response at the population level, as well as to correlated responses in populational and individual traits.

TI Within and between population variation in disease resistance in cyclic
   populations of western tent caterpillars: a test of the disease defence
   hypothesis
AB Epizootics of nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) are an obvious component of the population fluctuations of several species of temperate forest Lepidoptera, including the western tent caterpillar, Malacosoma californicum pluviale (Dyer). An observed relationship between epizootics and the subsequent reduction in fecundity of populations led to the formulation of the disease defence hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts that viral epizootics in peak populations select for more resistant moths and that their reduced fecundity in declining populations reflects a cost of disease resistance.
   To test the disease defence hypothesis, we carried out bioassays to measure the variation in larval resistance to NPV infection for families of western tent caterpillars from four spatially distinct populations over 3 years of peak and declining host densities.
   Each female moth lays a single egg mass and larvae are gregarious and remain together through development. We found that the resistance to disease of larvae within families was not related to the number of eggs in the mass from which they hatched (the fecundity of their mother).
   Disease resistance of larvae varied among populations and over time in a manner consistent with selection for resistance. One population that had not experienced a strong viral epizootic during the last population decline was more susceptible to infection in the first year of the study. Larvae from a second population that experienced an early epizootic became significantly more resistant. The resistance of two other populations increased slightly before the viral epizootic occurred in the field however, and thus could not be explained by selection.
   As population densities declined from peak density, the background mortality of larvae increased and the fecundity of moths decreased. This indicates a general deterioration in the quality of field populations of tent caterpillars associated with the declining populations.
   Although some evidence suggests that viral epizootics can select for increased resistance of field populations of tent caterpillars, the general deterioration in quality, elevated background mortality, and the reduced fecundity after the epizootic are stronger influences on the population decline. These are possibly related to sublethal viral infection.

TI The Price equation framework to study disease within-host evolution
AB The evolution of infectious diseases is known to affect epidemiological dynamics, but, for some viruses and bacteria, this evolution also takes place inside a host during the course of an infection. I develop an original approach to study intrahost evolutionary dynamics of quantitative disease traits. This approach can be expressed mathematically using the 'Price equation' framework recently developed in evolutionary epidemiology. This framework combines population genetics and within-host population dynamics models to identify trade-offs that affect disease intrahost evolution and to predict short-term evolutionary dynamics of life-history traits. I show that this can be applied to study the evolution of viruses competing for host cells or to study the coevolution between parasites and the immune system of the host. This framework can also easily incorporate experimental data. Studying intrahost evolutionary dynamics provides insight at the within-host level, because it allows us to better understand the course of chronic infections, and at the epidemiological level, because it helps to study multi-scale evolutionary processes. This framework can be used to address important biological issues, from immune escape to disease evolutionary response to treatments.

AB Oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a cause of oropharyngeal cancer. We investigated whether sexual behaviors that elevated the odds of oropharyngeal cancer developing in a case-control study similarly elevated the odds of oral HPV infection developing among control patients. HPV infection was detected in 4.8% of 332 control patients from an outpatient clinic and in 2.9% of 210 college-aged men ( age range, 18-23 years). Among control patients, the odds of infection developing independently increased with increases in the lifetime number of oral (P = .007, for trend) or vaginal sex partners (P = .003, for trend). Among college-aged men, the odds of oral HPV infection developing increased with increases in the number of recent oral sex partners (P = .046, for trend) or open-mouthed kissing partners (P = .023, for trend) but not vaginal sex partners. Oral sex and open-mouthed kissing are associated with the development of oral HPV infection.

TI A Common CD4 Gene Variant Is Associated with an Increased Risk of HIV-1
   Infection in Kenyan Female Commercial Sex Workers
AB Background. It has been predicted that CD4 C868T, a novel CD4 single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) that has been found to be highly prevalent among Africans, changes the tertiary structure of CD4, which may alter susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
   Methods. Participants were from a Kenyan cohort and included 87 uninfected and 277 HIV-1-infected individuals. DNA sequencing was used to determine CD4 genotype. A2.01 cells expressing similar levels of either wild-type CD4 or CD4-Trp240 as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells from uninfected donors were infected with HIV-1(IIIB) or a Kenyan primary HIV-1 isolate. HIV-1 p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the outcome of infection.
   Results. CD4 C868T was found to be significantly more prevalent among HIV-1-infected participants than among HIV-1-uninfected participants (P = .002), and C868T was associated with an increased incidence of HIV-1 infection as well (P = .005, log-rank test; P = .009, Wilcoxon test), with an odds ratio of 2.49 (P = .009). Both in vitro and ex vivo models demonstrated a significant association between CD4 C868T and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection (P = .001 and P = .003, respectively).
   Conclusion. Overall, the present study found a strong correlation between CD4 C868T and increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Given the high prevalence of both HIV infection and CD4 C868T in African populations, the effect of this SNP on the epidemic in Africa could be dramatic.

AB The European Network for Infectious Diseases (EUNID) is a network of clinicians, public health epidemiologists, microbiologists, infection control, and critical-care doctors from the European member states, who are experienced in the management of patients with highly infectious diseases. We aim to develop a consensus recommendation for infection control during clinical management and invasive procedures in such patients. After an extensive literature review, draft recommendations were amended jointly by 27 partners from 15 European countries. Recommendations include repetitive training of staff to ascertain infection control, systematic use of cough and respiratory etiquette at admission to the emergency department, fluid sampling in the isolation room, and analyses in biosafety level 3/4 laboratories, and preference for point-of-care bedside laboratory tests. Children should be cared for by paediatricians and intensive-care patients should be cared for by critical-care doctors in high-level isolation units (HLIU). Invasive procedures should be avoided if unnecessary or done in the HLIU, as should chest radiography, ultrasonography, and renal dialysis. Procedures that require transport of patients out of the HLIU should be done during designated sessions or hours in secure transport. Picture archiving and communication systems should be used. Post-mortem examination should be avoided; biopsy or blood collection is preferred.

TI Parasite genetic differentiation by habitat type and host species:
   molecular epidemiology of Schistosoma japonicum in hilly and marshland
   areas of Anhui Province, China
AB Schistosoma japonicum, a parasite of significant public health importance in parts of China and Southeast Asia, is a true generalist pathogen with over 40 species of mammals suspected as definitive host reservoirs. In order to characterize levels of parasite gene flow across host species and identify the most important zoonotic reservoirs, S. japonicum larvae (miracidia) were sampled from a range of definitive host species in two contrasting habitat types within Anhui Province, China: a low-lying marshland region, and a hilly region, where animal reservoir populations may be predicted to differ substantially. Miracidia samples were genotyped using seven multiplexed microsatellite markers. Hierarchical F-statistics and clustering analyses revealed substantial geographical structuring of S. japonicum populations within Anhui, with strong parasite genetic differentiation between habitat types. Within most villages, there was very little or no parasite genetic differentiation among host species, suggesting frequent S. japonicum gene flow, and thus also transmission, across species. Moreover, the data provide novel molecular evidence that rodents and dogs are potentially very important infection reservoirs in hilly regions, in contrast to bovines in the marshland regions. The parasite genetic differentiation between habitat types might therefore be associated with contrasting host reservoirs. The high levels of parasite gene flow observed across host species in sympatric areas have important implications for S. japonicum control, particularly in hilly regions where control of infection among wild rodent populations could be challenging.

TI Australia's Dengue Risk Driven by Human Adaptation to Climate Change
AB Background: The reduced rainfall in southeast Australia has placed this region's urban and rural communities on escalating water restrictions, with anthropogenic climate change forecasts suggesting that this drying trend will continue. To mitigate the stress this may place on domestic water supply, governments have encouraged the installation of large domestic water tanks in towns and cities throughout this region. These prospective stable mosquito larval sites create the possibility of the reintroduction of Ae. aegypti from Queensland, where it remains endemic, back into New South Wales and other populated centres in Australia, along with the associated emerging and re-emerging dengue risk if the virus was to be introduced.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Having collated the known distribution of Ae. aegypti in Australia, we built distributional models using a genetic algorithm to project Ae. aegypti's distribution under today's climate and under climate change scenarios for 2030 and 2050 and compared the outputs to published theoretical temperature limits. Incongruence identified between the models and theoretical temperature limits highlighted the difficulty of using point occurrence data to study a species whose distribution is mediated more by human activity than by climate. Synthesis of this data with dengue transmission climate limits in Australia derived from historical dengue epidemics suggested that a proliferation of domestic water storage tanks in Australia could result in another range expansion of Ae. aegypti which would present a risk of dengue transmission in most major cities during their warm summer months.
   Conclusions/Significance: In the debate of the role climate change will play in the future range of dengue in Australia, we conclude that the increased risk of an Ae. aegypti range expansion in Australia would be due not directly to climate change but rather to human adaptation to the current and forecasted regional drying through the installation of large domestic water storing containers. The expansion of this efficient dengue vector presents both an emerging and re-emerging disease risk to Australia. Therefore, if the installation and maintenance of domestic water storage tanks is not tightly controlled, Ae. aegypti could expand its range again and cohabit with the majority of Australia's population, presenting a high potential dengue transmission risk during our warm summers.

TI Spatio-Temporal Tracking and Phylodynamics of an Urban Dengue 3 Outbreak
   in Sao Paulo, Brazil
AB The dengue virus has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of similar to 10.700 nucleotides with a single open reading frame that encodes three structural (C, prM, and E) and seven nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins. It possesses four antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV 1-4). Many phylogenetic studies address particularities of the different serotypes using convenience samples that are not conducive to a spatio-temporal analysis in a single urban setting. We describe the pattern of spread of distinct lineages of DENV-3 circulating in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil, during 2006. Blood samples from patients presenting dengue-like symptoms were collected for DENV testing. We performed M-N-PCR using primers based on NS5 for virus detection and identification. The fragments were purified from PCR mixtures and sequenced. The positive dengue cases were geo-coded. To type the sequenced samples, 52 reference sequences were aligned. The dataset generated was used for iterative phylogenetic reconstruction with the maximum likelihood criterion. The best demographic model, the rate of growth, rate of evolutionary change, and Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) were estimated. The basic reproductive rate during the epidemics was estimated. We obtained sequences from 82 patients among 174 blood samples. We were able to geo-code 46 sequences. The alignment generated a 399-nucleotide-long dataset with 134 taxa. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that all samples were of DENV-3 and related to strains circulating on the isle of Martinique in 2000-2001. Sixty DENV-3 from Sao Jose do Rio Preto formed a monophyletic group (lineage 1), closely related to the remaining 22 isolates (lineage 2). We assumed that these lineages appeared before 2006 in different occasions. By transforming the inferred exponential growth rates into the basic reproductive rate, we obtained values for lineage 1 of R(0) = 1.53 and values for lineage 2 of R(0) = 1.13. Under the exponential model, TMRCA of lineage 1 dated 1 year and lineage 2 dated 3.4 years before the last sampling. The possibility of inferring the spatio-temporal dynamics from genetic data has been generally little explored, and it may shed light on DENV circulation. The use of both geographic and temporally structured phylogenetic data provided a detailed view on the spread of at least two dengue viral strains in a populated urban area.

TI Seasonal host dynamics drive the timing of recurrent epidemics in a
   wildlife population
AB The seasonality of recurrent epidemics has been largely neglected, especially where patterns are not driven by forces external to the population. Here, we use data on cowpox virus in field voles to explore the seasonal patterns in wildlife (variable abundance) populations and compare these with patterns previously found in humans. Timing in our system was associated with both the number and the rate of recruitment of susceptible hosts. A plentiful and sustained supply of susceptible hosts throughout the summer gave rise to a steady rise in infected hosts and a late peak. A meagre supply more limited in time was often insufficient to sustain an increase in infected hosts, leading to an early peak followed by a decline. These seasonal patterns differed from those found in humans, but the underlying association found between the timing and the supply of susceptible hosts was similar to that in humans. We also combine our data with a model to explore these differences between humans and wildlife. Model results emphasize the importance of the interplay between seasonal infection and recruitment and suggest that our empirical patterns have a relevance extending beyond our own system.

TI Can parasites drive population cycles in mountain hares?
AB Understanding the drivers of population fluctuations is a central goal of ecology. Although well-established theory suggests that parasites can drive cyclic population fluctuations in their hosts, field evidence is lacking. Theory predicts that a parasite that loosely aggregates in the host population and has stronger impact on host fecundity than survival should induce cycling. The helminth Trichostrongylus retortaeformis in the UK's only native lagomorph, the mountain hare, has exactly these properties, and the hares exhibit strong population fluctuations. Here we use a host-parasite model parametrized using the available empirical data to test this superficial concordance between theory and observation. In fact, through an innovative combination of sensitivity and stability analyses, we show that hare population cycles do not seem to be driven by the parasite. Potential limitations in our parametrization and model formulation, together with the possible secondary roles for parasites in determining hare demography, are discussed. Improving our knowledge of leveret biology and the quantification of harvesting emerge as future research priorities. With the growing concern over the present management of mountain hares for disease control in Scotland, understanding their population drivers is an important prerequisite for the effective management of this species.

TI Geographic Variation in the Prevalence of Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated
   Herpesvirus and Risk Factors for Transmission
AB Background. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in the female general population, to define geographic variation in and heterosexual transmission of the virus.
   Methods. The study included 10,963 women from 9 countries for whom information on sociodemographic characteristics and reproductive, sexual, and smoking behaviors were available. Antibodies against KSHV that encoded lytic antigen K8.1 and latent antigen ORF73 were determined.
   Results. The range of prevalence of KSHV (defined as detection of any antigen) was 3.81%-46.02%, with significant geographic variation noted. In Nigeria, the prevalence was 46.02%; in Colombia, 13.32%; in Costa Rica, 9.81%; in Argentina, 6.40%; in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 15.50%; in Hanoi, Vietnam, 11.26%; in Songkla, Thailand, 10%; in Lampang, Thailand, 8.63%; in Korea, 4.93%; and in Spain, 3.65%. The prevalence of KSHV slightly increased with increasing age among subjects in geographic areas where the prevalence of KSHV was high, such as Nigeria and Colombia, and it significantly decreased with increases in the educational level attained by subjects in those areas. KSHV was not statistically associated with age at first sexual intercourse, number of sex partners, number of children, patterns of oral contraceptive use, presence of cervical human papillomavirus DNA, or smoking status.
   Conclusions. The study provides comparable estimates of KSHV prevalence in diverse cultural settings across 4 continents and provides evidence that sexual transmission of KSHV is not a major source of infection in the general population.

TI Rosiglitazone Modulates the Innate Immune Response to Plasmodium
   falciparum Infection and Improves Outcome in Experimental Cerebral
   Malaria
AB For severe malarial syndromes such as cerebral malaria, adverse clinical outcomes are often mediated by the immune system rather than caused by the parasite directly. However, few therapeutic agents have been developed to modulate the host's immunopathological responses to infection. Here, we report that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) agonist rosiglitazone modulated the host response to malaria by enhancing phagocytic clearance of malaria-parasitized erythrocytes and by decreasing inflammatory responses to infection via inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum glycosylphosphatidylinositol-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathways. We found that, in the Plasmodium berghei strain ANKA experimental model of cerebral malaria, rosiglitazone modified the inflammatory response to malarial infection and improved the survival rate even when treatment was initiated as late as day 5 after infection. Furthermore, rosiglitazone reduced the parasitemia in a CD36-dependent manner in the Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi hyperparasitemia model. These data suggest that PPAR gamma agonists represent a novel class of host immunomodulatory drugs that may be useful for treatment of severe malaria syndromes.

TI Distinguishing epidemic waves from disease spillover in a wildlife
   population
AB Serengeti lions frequently experience viral outbreaks. In 1994, one-third of Serengeti lions died from canine distemper virus (CDV). Based on the limited epidemiological data available from this period, it has been unclear whether the 1994 outbreak was propagated by lion-to-lion transmission alone or involved multiple introductions from other sympatric carnivore species. More broadly, we do not know whether contacts between lions allow any pathogen with a relatively short infectious period to percolate through the population (i.e. reach epidemic proportions). We built one of the most realistic contact network models for a wildlife population to date, based on detailed behavioural and movement data from a long-term lion study population. The model allowed us to identify previously unrecognized biases in the sparse data from the 1994 outbreak and develop methods for judiciously inferring disease dynamics from typical wildlife samples. Our analysis of the model in light of the 1994 outbreak data strongly suggest that, although lions are sufficiently well connected to sustain epidemics of CDV-like diseases, the 1994 epidemic was fuelled by multiple spillovers from other carnivore species, such as jackals and hyenas.

TI The Implications of Coevolutionary Dynamics to Host-Parasite
   Interactions
AB Due to the importance of infectious disease, there is a large body of theory on the evolution of either hosts or, more commonly, parasites. Here we present a fully coevolutionary model of a host-parasite system that includes ecological dynamics that feed back into the coevolutionary outcome, and we show that highly virulent parasites may evolve due to the coevolutionary process. Parasite evolution is very sensitive to evolution in the host, and virulence fluctuates substantially when mutation rates vary between host and parasite. Evolutionary branching in the host leads to parasites increasing their virulence, and small changes in host resistance drive large changes in parasite virulence. Evolutionary branching in one species does not cause branching in the other. Our work emphasizes the importance of considering coevolutionary dynamics and shows that certain highly virulent parasites may result from responses to host evolution.

TI Sea-Cage Aquaculture, Sea Lice, and Declines of Wild Fish
AB A sea cage, sometimes referred to as a net pen, is an enclosure designed to prevent farm fish from escaping and to protect them from large predators, while allowing a free flow of water through the cage to carry away waste. Farm fish thus share water with wild fish, which enables transmission of parasites, such as sea lice, from wild to farm and farm to wild fishes. Sea lice epidemics, together with recently documented population-level declines of wild salmon in areas of sea-cage farming, are a reminder that sea-cage aquaculture is fundamentally different from terrestrial animal culture. The difference is that sea cages protect farm fish from the usual pathogen-control mechanisms of nature, such as predators, but not from the pathogens themselves. A sea cage thus becomes an unintended pathogen factory. Basic physical theory explains why sea-cage aquaculture causes sea lice on sympatric wild fish to increase and why increased lice burdens cause wild fish to decline, with extirpation as a real possibility. Theory is important to this issue because slow declines of wild fish can be difficult to detect amid large fluctuations from other causes. The important theoretical concepts are equilibrium, host-density effect, reservoir-host effect, and critical stocking level of farmed fish (stocking level at which lice proliferate on farm fish even if wild fish are not present to infect them). I explored these concepts and their implications without mathematics through examples from salmon farming. I also considered whether the lice-control techniques used by sea-cage farmers (medication and shortened grow-out times) are capable of protecting wild fish. Elementary probability showed that W=W = F (where W is the abundance of wild fish, W* is the prefarm abundance, F is the abundance of farm fish, and is the ratio of lice per farm fish to lice per wild fish). Declines of wild fish can be reduced by short growing cycles for farm fish, medicating farm fish, and keeping farm stocking levels low. Declines can be avoided only by ensuring that wild fish do not share water with farmed fish, either by locating sea cages very far from wild fish or through the use of closed-containment aquaculture systems. These principles are likely to govern any aquaculture system where cage-protected farm hosts and sympatric wild hosts have a common parasite with a direct life cycle.

TI New Findings from an Old Pathogen: Intraerythrocytic Bacteria (Family
   Anaplasmatacea) in Red-Backed Salamanders Plethodon cinereus
AB During a recent study of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), we discovered an intraerythrocytic organism typified by violet-staining, intracellular inclusions, consistent with descriptions of Cytamoeba or Aegyptianella (bacteria). Here we characterize its taxonomic status using molecular techniques and ask basic questions about its nature. Blood smears from 102 salamanders were examined from Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia to determine prevalence, and whole blood from several infected animals was tested using a PCR which targets the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (1201 bp) indicated this organism was in the order Rickettsiales and is likely a member of the family Anaplasmatacea. The organism differed from currently described taxa and was clearly differentiated from Aegyptianella pullorum of birds and "Candidatus Hemobacterium ranarum" (formally A. ranarum) of frogs. Of all salamanders, 17 (16.7%) were infected and these were significantly larger (snout-vent length) and had higher body condition scores than uninfected ones, and males were more likely to be infected than females. Erythrocytes affected by the pathogen were 5% larger than unaffected ones, but otherwise similar in morphology. Infected animals tended to have a greater number of circulating white blood cells, based on estimates from smears, indicating a nonspecific response to the pathogen by the innate immune system. Given its phylogenetic position, this pathogen is likely transmitted by an arthropod vector, and the male-biased prevalence strongly implicates trombiculid mites, which also live in leaf litter and affect male salamanders more so than females.

TI Testing Mechanisms of the Dilution Effect: Deer Mice Encounter Rates,
   Sin Nombre Virus Prevalence and Species Diversity
AB Species diversity has been shown to decrease prevalence of disease in a variety of host-pathogen systems, in a phenomenon termed the Dilution Effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed by which diversity may decrease prevalence, though few have been tested in natural host-pathogen systems. We investigated the mechanisms by which diversity influenced the prevalence of Sin Nombre virus (SNV), a directly transmitted virus in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). We monitored both intra and interspecific encounters of deer mice using foraging arenas at five sites in the Great Basin Desert with disparate levels of species diversity to examine two potential mechanisms which may contribute to the dilution of SNV prevalence: (1) reduced frequency of encounters between deer mice, or (2) reduced duration of contacts between deer mice. We also investigated the relationship between deer mouse density and these mechanisms, as density is often predicted to influence both inter and intraspecific encounters. Results of our study indicate that frequency of intraspecific interactions between deer mice was reduced with increased diversity. Species diversity did not impact average duration of encounters. Density was correlated with absolute, but not relative rates of encounters between deer mice, suggesting that encounters may be influenced by factors other than density. Our study indicates that species diversity influences the dynamics of SNV by reducing encounters between deer mice in a trade-off between intra and interspecific interactions.

TI Role of Wild Suids in the Epidemiology of African Swine Fever
AB There is presently no vaccine to combat African swine fever (ASF), a viral hemorrhagic fever of domestic pigs that causes up to 100% morbidity and mortality in naive, commercial pig populations. In its endemic setting, ASF virus cycles between asymptomatic warthogs and soft ticks, with persistence in exotic locations being ascribed to the almost global distribution of susceptible soft tick and suid hosts. An understanding of the role played by diverse hosts in the epidemiology of this multi-host disease is crucial for effective disease control. Unlike the intensively studied Ornithodoros tick vector, the role of many wild suids remains obscure, despite growing recognition for suid-exclusive virus cycling, without the agency of the argasid tick, at some localities. Because the four wild suid genera, Phacochoerus, Potamochoerus, Hylochoerus, and Sus differ from each other in taxonomy, distribution, ecology, reservoir host potential, virus shedding, ASF symptomology, and domestic-pig contact potential, their role in disease epidemiology is also varied. This first consolidated summary of ASF epidemiology in relation to wild suids summarizes current knowledge and identifies information gaps and future research priorities crucial for formulating effective disease control strategies.

TI Rapid evolution, seasonality, and the termination of parasite epidemics
AB Why do epidemics end? This simple question has puzzled ecologists and epidemiologists for decades. Early explanations focused on drops in host density arising from highly virulent parasites and, later, on the effects of acquired immunity. More recently, however, two additional epidemic-ending mechanisms have surfaced: environmental change (including seasonality) and rapid evolution of increased resistance of hosts to infection. Both mechanisms, via either decreasing seasonal temperatures or evolution of resistance, act by altering transmission rates. To explore these possibilities, we tracked five epidemics of a virulent yeast parasite in lake populations of Daphnia dentifera from late summer through autumn. We then fit and compared performance of time-series models that included temperature-dependent and/or evolutionary changes in transmission rates. The analyses show evolution to be the better explanation of epidemic dynamics. Thus, by integrating data and models, this study highlights the potential role of evolution in driving the termination of epidemics in natural populations.

TI Does elevated testosterone result in increased exposure and transmission
   of parasites?
AB Male-biased infection is a common phenomenon in vertebrate-parasite systems and male-biased transmission has been experimentally demonstrated. One mechanism that is hypothesized to create male-biased transmission is the immuno-suppressive effect of testosterone because it increases susceptibility to infection. Testosterone also influences host behaviour and, consequently, may increase exposure to parasites. To test how testosterone could increase exposure and transmission, we undertook a longitudinal mark-recapture study where we experimentally elevated testosterone levels in wild male rodents. Individuals in control populations reduced the average number of contacts over the treatment period, while populations with experimentally elevated testosterone levels maintained the number of contacts between hosts. As a result, the transmission potential was higher in testosterone treated populations compared to controls. Our results indicated that males with high-testosterone levels alter the population-level contacts, producing different social networks and increasing transmission potential compared to those where testosterone is at background levels.

TI Cyclic hantavirus epidemics in humans - Predicted by rodent host
   dynamics
AB Wildlife-originated zoonotic diseases are a major contributor to emerging infectious diseases. Hantaviruses cause thousands of human disease cases annually worldwide, and understanding and predicting human hantavirus epidemics still poses unsolved challenges. Here we studied the three-level relationships between the human disease nephropathia epidemica (NE), its etiological agent Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) and the rodent host of the virus, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). A large and long-term data set (14 years, 2583 human NE cases and 4751 trapped bank voles) indicates that the number of human infections shows both seasonal and multi-annual fluctuations, is influenced by the phase of vole cycle and time of the year, and follows vole abundance with a lag of a few months. Our results suggest that although human hantavirus epidemics are preceded by high sero prevalence in the host population, they may be accurately predicted solely by the population dynamics of the carrier species, even without any knowledge about hantavirus dynamics in the host populations.

TI How to find natural reservoir hosts from endemic prevalence in a
   multi-host population: A case study of influenza in waterfowl
AB The transmission dynamics of infectious diseases critically depend on reservoir hosts, which can sustain the pathogen (or maintain the transmission) in the population even in the absence of other hosts. Although a theoretical foundation of the transmission dynamics in a multi-host population has been established, no quantitative methods exist for the identification of natural reservoir hosts. For a host to maintain the transmission alone, the host-specific reproduction number (U), interpreted as the average number of secondary transmissions caused by a single primary case in the host(s) of interest in the absence of all other hosts, must be greater than unity. If the host-excluded reproduction number (Q), representing the average number of secondary transmissions per single primary case in other hosts in the absence of the host(s) of interest, is below unity, transmission cannot be maintained in the multi-host population in the absence of the focal host(s).
   The present study proposes a simple method for the identification of reservoir host(s) from observed endemic prevalence data across a range of host species. As an example, we analyze an aggregated surveillance dataset of influenza A virus in wild birds among which dabbling ducks exhibit higher prevalence compared to other bird species. Since the heterogeneous contact patterns between different host species are not directly observable, we test four different contact structures to account for the uncertainty. Meeting the requirements of U>1 and Q<1 for all four different contact structures, mallards and other dabbling ducks most likely constitute the reservoir community which plays a predominant role in maintaining the transmission of influenza A virus in the water bird population. We further discuss epidemiological issues which are concerned with the interpretation of influenza prevalence data, identifying key features to be fully clarified in the future.

TI HOST SPECIALIZATION DIFFERENTIATES CRYPTIC SPECIES OF FEATHER-FEEDING
   LICE
AB Parasite species with differentiated host-specific populations provide a natural opportunity to explore factors involved in parasite diversification. Columbicola macrourae is a species of ectoparasitic feather louse currently recognized from 15 species of New World pigeons and doves. Mitochondrial sequences reveal five divergent haplotype clusters within C. macrourae, suggesting cryptic species. Each cluster is relatively host specific, with only one or a few hosts. We conducted a reciprocal transfer experiment with two of these lineages to test whether host use has an adaptive component. Our results demonstrate that the fitness of each lineage is considerably higher on its native host than on the novel host suggesting that one or more selective agents favor host specialization by the different lineages. In addition, we were able to morphologically separate individual lice from the two experimental lineages using discriminant function analysis. Furthermore, differences in the size of these louse lineages match differences in the size of their respective hosts, paralleling the strong correlation between parasite and host body size across the genus Columbicola. Together, these results suggest that selection in this cryptic species complex reflects selection across the whole genus, and that this selection, in part, contributes to the maintenance of host specialization.

TI GENOTYPIC VARIATION AND THE ROLE OF DEFENSIVE ENDOSYMBIONTS IN AN
   ALL-PARTHENOGENETIC HOST-PARASITOID INTERACTION
AB Models of host-parasite coevolution predict pronounced genetic dynamics if resistance and infectivity are genotype-specific or associated with costs, and if selection is fueled by sufficient genetic variation. We addressed these assumptions in the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, and its parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum. Parasitoid genotypes differed in infectivity and host clones exhibited huge variation for susceptibility. This variation occurred at two levels. Clones harboring Hamiltonella defensa, a bacterial endosymbiont known to protect pea aphids against parasitoids, enjoyed greatly reduced susceptibility, yet clones without H. defensa also exhibited significant variation. Although there was no evidence for genotype-specificity in the H. defensa-free clones' interaction with parasitoids, we found such evidence in clones containing the bacterium. This suggests that parasitoid genotypes differ in their ability to overcome H. defensa, resulting in an apparent host x parasitoid genotype interaction that may in fact be due to an underlying symbiont x parasitoid genotype interaction. Aphid susceptibility to parasitoids correlated negatively with fecundity and rate of increase, due to H. defensa-bearing clones being more fecund on average. Hence, possessing symbionts may also be favorable in the absence of parasitoids, which raises the question why H. defensa does not go to fixation and highlights the need to develop new models to understand the dynamics of endosymbiont-mediated coevolution.

TI Soil microorganisms in coastal foredunes control the ectoparasitic
   root-feeding nematode Tylenchorhynchus ventralis by local interactions
AB In natural grassland ecosystems, root-feeding nematodes and insects are the dominant below-ground herbivores. In coastal foredunes, the ectoparasitic nematode Tylenchorhynchus ventralis would be a major root herbivore if not strongly controlled by soil microorganisms. Here, we examined if the suppressive effects of the microbial enemies of T. ventralis act by local interactions such as predation, parasitism or antagonism, or local induction of plant defence, or by non-local interactions, such as systemic effects when microorganisms in one section of the plant roots can affect nematode control in another section of the root system. We show that abundance of T. ventralis in the root zone of the grass Ammophila arenaria is suppressed by local interactions.
   We compared local vs. non-local control of nematodes by a natural community of soil microorganisms in a split-root experiment, where nematodes and microbes were inoculated to the same, or to opposite root compartments.
   The split-root experiment revealed that microorganisms affected T. ventralis numbers only when present in the same root compartment. Therefore, the effects of microorganisms on T. ventralis are due to local interactions and not due to induction of a systemic defence mechanism in the plant host.
   When inoculated together with microorganisms, the nematodes were heavily infected with unknown bacteria and with fungi that resembled the genus Catenaria, suggesting that microorganisms control nematodes through parasitism. However, local defence induction cannot be completely excluded.
   Besides microbial enemies of nematodes, the root zone of A. arenaria also contains plant pathogens. Root biomass was reduced by nematode infection, but also by the combination of nematodes and microorganisms, most likely because the soil pathogens overwhelmed the effects of nematode control on plant production.
   We conclude that there may be a trade-off between beneficial effects of soil microorganisms on the plant host due to nematode control vs. pathogenic effects of soil microorganisms on the plant host. We propose that such trade-offs require more attention when studying below-ground multitrophic interactions.

TI Editor's choice: Disease dynamics in marine metapopulations: modelling
   infectious diseases on coral reefs
AB Coral reefs are experiencing devastating mortality due, in part, to emerging disease. Despite this growing problem, the long-term consequences of infectious disease in marine ecosystems remain poorly understood, and the application of epidemiological models to marine disease systems represents a research priority for managing resources in the world's oceans.
   Metapopulation models may provide a framework for modelling coral population dynamics at the regional scale, and we use this approach to investigate the effects of infectious disease. The model presented here incorporates a susceptible-infected or 'S-I' disease into a system of patchily distributed, dynamic coral hosts, and highlights some basic differences that set many marine disease systems apart from their terrestrial counterparts.
   The model predicts several possible long-term outcomes of disease introduction, and suggests that the consequences of disease may vary considerably among different pathogens and regions. Due to the long time-scales for coral dynamics, epizootics are expected to be prolonged with recovery slow at the regional scale.
   Our model results show how infectious disease can substantially alter host metapopulation dynamics, with some non-linear relationships which are likely to affect the response of these systems to management and environmental change. For example, higher rates of coral colonization can have variable consequences for host population occupancy (i.e. coral cover) when infectious disease is considered, and chronic diseases with long-lived pathogens pose the highest risks for regional coral extinction.
   Synthesis and applications. We present a tractable epidemiological model within a metapopulation framework and compare the model output with empirical data for a white plague type II (WPII) outbreak among coral of the upper Florida Keys. We conclude that this model fits well with the spatial and temporal patterns of WPII over a decade. Despite terrestrial-marine differences, many patterns derived from our model are consistent with epidemiological principles. Thus, the careful application of these principles within the context of marine management may be a promising research frontier. Although we focus on coral disease, the methods and results may apply to other marine metapopulations.

TI Local host competition in the evolution of virulence
AB The evolution of parasite life histories should usually have correlated effects on host survivorship and/or reproductive success. For example, parasites that reproduce more rapidly might be expected to cause greater reductions in host fitness. Important theoretical advances have recently been made on virulence evolution, but the results are not always consistent. Here I compare two models [Q. Rev. Biol.71 (1996) 37; Q. Rev. Biol.75 (2000) 261] on the evolution of virulence that get qualitatively different results with respect to the effects of coinfection. I also construct a third model that attempts to connect these two formulations. The results suggest that parasite growth rates should increase as local host competition increases, unless relatedness is at equilibrium. In addition, the qualitative effect of adding coinfections on parasite growth rates depends critically on how the number of coinfections affects transmission success.

TI Clinician's guide to human papillomavirus immunology: knowns and
   unknowns
AB Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common genital infection that has the potential to develop into cervical cancer in some women. This Review summarises current knowledge on the mechanisms of host immunity that help prevent and control HPV infection and the viral factors that exist to avoid immune surveillance. Although most women clear the infection within a few months, the virus induces a shift towards immune tolerance that can facilitate persistence and permit tumorigenesis. Mechanisms used by HPV to avoid immune surveillance and control include infecting only the basal layer of the cervical epithelium, limiting expression of viral proteins until later stages of epithelial differentiation, undergoing non-lytic replication, and downregulating the expression of important receptors on cells of the innate immune system. Furthermore, HPV suppresses the expression of several proinflammatory proteins that are crucial in clearing infection and activating the cytotoxic T lymphocytes involved in killing virus-infected cells. Interestingly, neutralising antibodies, although of uncertain effectiveness in preventing infection or reinfection after natural exposure (prior infection), are highly protective after immunisation with HPV virus-like-particle-based vaccines. Understanding what is known and unknown about the interaction between the immune system and HPV is important in the assessment of the potential contribution of prophylactic vaccination in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer. However, despite our growing understanding, many aspects of the interactions between HPV and the host immune system remain unknown, and this Review draws attention to several of these unresolved issues and their implications.

AB Concerted action is needed to address public health issues raised by climate change. In this Review we discuss infections acquired through various routes (arthropod vector, rodent, water, food, and air) in view of a changing climate in Europe. Based on an extensive review of published work and expert workshops, we present an assessment of the infectious disease challenges: incidence, prevalence, and distribution are projected to shift in a changing environment. Due to the high level of uncertainty on the rate of climate change and its impact on infectious diseases, we propose to mount a proactive public health response by building an integrated network for environmental and epidemiological data. This network would have the capacity to connect epidemic intelligence and infectious disease surveillance with meteorological, entomological, water quality, remote sensing, and other data, for multivariate analyses and predictions. Insights from these analyses could then guide adaptation strategies and protect population health from impending threats related to climate change.

To examine in detail the earliest steps in the host response to leptospires, we used fluorescently labelled Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni to infect 30 hour post fertilization zebrafish embryos by either the caudal vein or hindbrain ventricle. These embryos have functional innate immunity but have not yet developed an adaptive immune system. Furthermore, they are optically transparent, allowing direct visualization of host-pathogen interactions from the moment of infection. We observed rapid uptake of leptospires by phagocytes, followed by persistent, intracellular infection over the first 48 hours. Phagocytosis of leptospires occasionally resulted in formation of large cellular vesicles consistent with apoptotic bodies. By 24 hours, clusters of infected phagocytes were accumulating lateral to the dorsal artery, presumably in early hematopoietic tissue. Our observations suggest that phagocytosis may be a key defense mechanism in the early stages of leptospirosis, and that phagocytic cells play roles in immunopathogenesis and likely in the dissemination of leptospires to specific target tissues.

TI Genetic Diversity of the Cestode Echinococcus multilocularis in Red
   Foxes at a Continental Scale in Europe
AB Background: Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a severe helminth disease affecting humans, which is caused by the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. AE represents a serious public health issue in larger regions of China, Siberia, and other regions in Asia. In Europe, a significant increase in prevalence since the 1990s is not only affecting the historically documented endemic area north of the Alps but more recently also neighbouring regions previously not known to be endemic. The genetic diversity of the parasite population and respective distribution in Europe have now been investigated in view of generating a fine-tuned map of parasite variants occurring in Europe. This approach may serve as a model to study the parasite at a worldwide level.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The genetic diversity of E. multilocularis was assessed based upon the tandemly repeated microsatellite marker EmsB in association with matching fox host geographical positions. Our study demonstrated a higher genetic diversity in the endemic areas north of the Alps when compared to other areas.
   Conclusions/Significance: The study of the spatial distribution of E. multilocularis in Europe, based on 32 genetic clusters, suggests that Europe can be considered as a unique global focus of E. multilocularis, which can be schematically drawn as a central core located in Switzerland and Jura Swabe flanked by neighbouring regions where the parasite exhibits a lower genetic diversity. The transmission of the parasite into peripheral regions is governed by a "mainland-island" system. Moreover, the presence of similar genetic profiles in both zones indicated a founder event.

TI The Neovolcanic Axis Is a Barrier to Gene Flow among Aedes aegypti
   Populations in Mexico That Differ in Vector Competence for Dengue 2
   Virus
AB Background: Aedes aegypti is the main mosquito vector of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). Previous population genetic and vector competence studies have demonstrated substantial genetic structure and major differences in the ability to transmit dengue viruses in Ae. aegypti populations in Mexico.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Population genetic studies revealed that the intersection of the Neovolcanic axis (NVA) with the Gulf of Mexico coast in the state of Veracruz acts as a discrete barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegypti populations north and south of the NVA. The mosquito populations north and south of the NVA also differed in their vector competence (VC) for dengue serotype 2 virus (DENV2). The average VC rate for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from populations from north of the NVA was 0.55; in contrast the average VC rate for mosquitoes from populations from south of the NVA was 0.20. Most of this variation was attributable to a midgut infection and escape barriers. In Ae. aegypti north of the NVA 21.5% failed to develop midgut infections and 30.3% of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection. In contrast, south of the NVA 45.2% failed to develop midgut infections and 62.8% of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection.
   Conclusions: Barriers to gene flow in vector populations may also impact the frequency of genes that condition continuous and epidemiologically relevant traits such as vector competence. Further studies are warranted to determine why the NVA is a barrier to gene flow and to determine whether the differences in vector competence seen north and south of the NVA are stable and epidemiologically significant.

TI Spatially Explicit West Nile Virus Risk Modeling in Santa Clara County,
   California
AB A geographic information system model designed to identify regions at risk for West Nile virus (WNV) transmission was calibrated and tested with data collected in Santa Clara County, California. American Crows that died from WNV infection in 2005 provided spatial and temporal ground truth. When the model was run with parameters based on Culex tarsalis infected with the NY99 genotype of the virus, it underestimated WNV occurrence in Santa Clara Co. The parameters were calibrated to fit the field data by reducing the number of degree-days necessary to reach the mosquito's extrinsic incubation period from 109 to 76. The calibration raised model efficiency from 61% to 92% accuracy, and the model performed well the following year in Santa Clara Co.

TI Patterns of Orthopox Virus Wild Rodent Hosts in South Germany
AB Although cowpox virus (CPXV) infections in a variety of dead-end hosts have been investigated in Germany for more than 50 years, data on species and geographical distribution of CPXV in reservoir hosts are sparse. Here we present the first comprehensive study of 825 rodents that have been collected in Bavaria, Southern Germany. In summary, six different rodent species (Apodemus flavicollis, Myodes glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus agrestis, and Arvicola amphibius) were trapped at three main trapping sites and investigated using a serum neutralization test (SNT). Prevalence of orthopox virus (OPV)-neutralizing antibodies was (with exception of one trapping site) highest in bank voles, ranging from 24.5% to 42.4%; often with SNT titers >= 96. Two up to 25% of yellow-necked mice were OPV sero-positive, but wood mice only at one site with 5.5%. Up to 7.7% of common voles were found to be OPV seroreactive, while M. agrestis and A. amphibius only sporadically showed seroreactivity. Further analyses of a subset of 450 bank voles and yellow-necked mice trapped at one site over a 18-month period revealed that male yellow-necked mice and female gravid yellow-necked mice had significantly more OPV-neutralizing antibodies. Mean body weight and OPV-seroreactivity were significantly negatively associated in male A. flavicollis. This was not due to shorter body length or smaller body mass index, but previously OPV-infected male A. flavicollis had dramatically reduced mean kidney weights. Seroreactivity in female bank voles was positively related to lung weights. We also found that both male yellow-necked mice and male bank voles with positive SNT titers had higher infestation rates with ectoparasites. We here show for the first time that A. flavicollis beside M. glareolus is a hypothetic host for CPXV, and that there are big geographical and spatial variations concerning the seroprevalence in rodent populations in South Germany.

TI Implications of vaccination and waning immunity
AB For infectious diseases where immunization can offer lifelong protection, a variety of simple models can be used to explain the utility of vaccination as a control method. However, for many diseases, immunity wanes over time and is subsequently enhanced ( boosted) by asymptomatic encounters with the infection. The study of this type of epidemiological process requires a model formulation that can capture both the within-host dynamics of the pathogen and immune system as well as the associated population-level transmission dynamics. Here, we parametrize such a model for measles and show how vaccination can have a range of unexpected consequences as it reduces the natural boosting of immunity as well as reducing the number of naive susceptibles. In particular, we show that moderate waning times (40-80 years) and high levels of vaccination ( greater than 70%) can induce large-scale oscillations with substantial numbers of symptomatic cases being generated at the peak. In addition, we predict that, after a long disease-free period, the introduction of infection will lead to far larger epidemics than that predicted by standard models. These results have clear implications for the long-term success of any vaccination campaign and highlight the need for a sound understanding of the immunological mechanisms of immunity and vaccination.

TI The evolution of covert, silent infection as a parasite strategy
AB Many parasites and pathogens cause silent/covert infections in addition to the more obvious infectious disease-causing pathology. Here, we consider how assumptions concerning superinfection, protection and seasonal host birth and transmission rates affect the evolution of such covert infections as a parasite strategy. Regardless of whether there is vertical infection or effects on sterility, overt infection is always disadvantageous in relatively constant host populations unless it provides protection from superinfection. If covert infections are protective, all individuals will enter the covert stage if there is enough vertical transmission, and revert to overt infections after a 'latent' period (susceptible, exposed, infected epidemiology). Seasonal variation in transmission rates selects for non-protective covert infections in relatively long-lived hosts with low birth rates typical of many mammals. Variable host population density caused by seasonal birth rates may also select for covert transmission, but in this case it is most likely in short-lived fecund hosts. The covert infections of some insects may therefore be explained by their outbreak population dynamics. However, our models consistently predict proportions of covert infection, which are lower than some of those observed in nature. Higher proportions of covert infection may occur if there is a direct link between covert infection and overt transmission success, the covert infection is protective or the covert state is the result of suppression by the host. Relatively low proportions of covert transmission may, however, be explained as a parasite strategy when transmission opportunities vary.

TI An experimental test of the independent action hypothesis in
   virus-insect pathosystems
AB The 'independent action hypothesis' (IAH) states that each pathogen individual has a non-zero probability of causing host death and that pathogen individuals act independently. IAH has not been rigorously tested. In this paper, we (i) develop a probabilistic framework for testing IAH and (ii) demonstrate that, in two out of the six virus-insect pathosystems tested, IAH is supported by the data. We first show that IAH inextricably links host survivorship to the number of infecting pathogen individuals, and develop a model to predict the frequency of single- and dual-genotype infections when a host is challenged with a mixture of two genotypes. Model predictions were tested using genetically marked, near-identical baculovirus genotypes, and insect larvae from three host species differing in susceptibility. Observations in early-instar larvae of two susceptible host species support IAH, but observations in late-instar larvae of susceptible host species and larvae of a less susceptible host species were not in agreement with IAH. Hence the model is experimentally supported only in pathosystems in which the host is highly susceptible. We provide, to our knowledge, the first qualitative experimental evidence that, in such pathosystems, the action of a single virion is sufficient to cause disease.

AB Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is a major public health problem worldwide. In 2004, the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study was established in Managua, Nicaragua, to study the natural history and transmission of dengue in children. Here, the authors describe the study design, methods, and results from 2004 to 2008. Initially, 3,721 children 2-9 years of age were recruited through door-to-door visits. Each year, new children aged 2 years are enrolled in the study to maintain the age structure. Children are provided with medical care through the study, and data from each medical visit are recorded on systematic study forms. All participants presenting with suspected dengue or undifferentiated fever are tested for dengue by virologic, serologic, and molecular biologic assays. Yearly blood samples are collected to detect inapparent dengue virus infections. Numerous information and communications technologies are used to manage study data, track samples, and maintain quality control, including personal data assistants, barcodes, global information systems, and fingerprint scans. Close collaboration with the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health and use of almost entirely local staff are essential components for success. This study is providing critical data on the epidemiology and transmission of dengue in the Americas needed for future vaccine trials.

TI Hantavirus Infection and Habitat Associations among Rodent Populations
   in Agroecosystems of Panama: Implications for Human Disease Risk
AB Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), which is caused by infection with Choclo virus, is uncommon in Panama, yet seropositivity among rural residents is as high as 60%. To clarify the environmental risk factors favoring rodent-to-human transmission, we tested serum from 3,067 rodents captured over a five-year period for antibodies against recombinant N protein of hantavirus by enzyme immunoassay and strip immunoblot. Among 220 seropositive rodents, Oligoryzomys fulvescens, the reservoir of Choclo virus, had the highest overall seroprevalence (23.5%); more abundant rodents (Zygodontomys brevicauda and Sigmodon hirsutus) had lower seroprevalences. In the mixed (combined modern and traditional) productive agroecosystem, the highest seroprevalence was among O. fulvescens captured in residences and in crops grown within 40 meters of a residence, with significantly lower seroprevalence in adjacent pasture and non-productive vegetation. Thus, crop habitats may serve as refugia for invasion into adjacent human residences and suggests several interventions to reduce human infection.

TI The Maintenance of Sex, Clonal Dynamics, and Host-Parasite Coevolution
   in a Mixed Population of Sexual and Asexual Snails
AB Sexual populations should be vulnerable to invasion and replacement by ecologically similar asexual females because asexual lineages have higher per capita growth rates. However, as asexual genotypes become common, they may also become disproportionately infected by parasites. The Red Queen hypothesis postulates that high infection rates in the common asexual clones could periodically favor the genetically diverse sexual individuals and promote the short-term coexistence of sexual and asexual populations. Testing this idea requires comparison of competing sexual and asexual lineages that are attacked by natural parasites. To date no such data have been available. Here, we report on long-term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a "mixed" (sexual and asexual) population of snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). We found that, within 7-10 years, the most common clones were almost completely replaced by initially rare clones in two different habitats, while sexuals persisted throughout the study period. The common clones, which were initially more resistant to infection, also became more susceptible to infection by sympatric (but not allopatric) parasites over the course of the study. These results are consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis and show that the coevolutionary dynamics predicted by the theory may also favor sexual reproduction in natural populations.

TI On the Causes of Selection for Recombination Underlying the Red Queen
   Hypothesis
AB The vast majority of plant and animal species reproduce sexually despite the costs associated with sexual reproduction. Genetic recombination might outweigh these costs if it helps the species escape parasite pressure by creating rare or novel genotypes, an idea known as the Red Queen hypothesis. Selection for recombination can be driven by short- and long-term effects, but the relative importance of these effects and their dependency on the parameters of an antagonistic species interaction remain unclear. We use computer simulations of a mathematical model of host-parasite coevolution to measure those effects under a wide range of parameters. We find that the real driving force underlying the Red Queen hypothesis is neither the immediate, next-generation, short- term effect nor the long-term effect but in fact a delayed short- term effect. Our results highlight the importance of differentiating clearly between immediate and delayed short- term effects when attempting to elucidate the mechanism underlying selection for recombination in the Red Queen hypothesis.

TI Host resistance reverses the outcome of competition between
   microparasites
AB Predators and parasites can control the abundance or biomass of herbivores with indirect effects on producer communities and ecosystems, but the interplay of multiple natural enemies may yield unexpected dynamics. We experimentally examined interactions between two microparasites (entomopathogenic nematodes) isolated from sandy grassland soils of coastal California: Heterorhabditis marelatus (Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema feltiae (Steinernematidae). Heterorhabditis marelatus drives trophic cascades by attacking root- and stem-boring ghost moth caterpillars (Hepialus californicus, Hepialidae), thereby indirectly protecting bush lupine shrubs (Lupinus arboreus, Fabaceae). Extensive field surveys demonstrated sympatric overlap in microhabitat use under lupine canopies and similar mean prevalence of the two nematode species. Using a response-surface design in the laboratory, we varied relative and absolute microparasite densities to test for competitive outcomes within an evolutionary naive host, larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae), and within the native host Hepialus californicus. Independent of conspecific or interspecific density, S. feltiae dominated as expected over H. marelatus within the naive Galleria, but S. feltiae infected hosts at low frequency and showed lower reproductive fitness than H. marelatus within native Hepialus hosts. Contrary to studies that demonstrate the pairwise dominance of steinernematid over heterorhabditid species in laboratory hosts, host resistance to S. feltiae may provide a mechanism for coexistence of multiple microparasite species. We hypothesize that the ubiquitous field prevalence and rapid life history of S. feltiae imply its use of widespread, abundant but small-bodied hosts and indicate the lack of direct competition with H. marelatus in the Hepialus-Lupinus trophic cascade.

TI Edaphic quality and plant-pathogen interactions: effects of soil calcium
   on fungal infection of a serpentine flax
AB Spatial variation in the frequency and outcome of interspecific interactions is thought to play a central role in shaping geographic patterns of biodiversity. Previous empirical studies and modeling exercises suggest that negative species interactions should occur with greater frequency and intensity in high-quality/low-stress environments. I tested this hypothesis through a four-year epidemiological study of interactions between the plant Hesperolinon californicum and the pathogenic rust fungus Melampsora lini. By virtue of its association with serpentine soils, H. californicum is exposed to edaphic conditions that are stressful to most plants. Notable among these is the low availability of calcium, an element that plays critically important roles in the immune responses of plants to attacking pathogens. As a serpentine generalist, however, H. californicum grows in soils with a wide range of calcium concentrations, and this should lead to differences in the frequency and/or severity of rust infection among host populations. I investigated geographic variation in disease pressure by conducting annual surveys in 16 populations spanning the host's distribution and representing a range of soil calcium concentrations. Results indicated that plants growing in more stressful low-calcium soils experienced higher rates of rust infection, suggesting that soil calcium may modulate host susceptibility in a manner opposite to that predicted by the a priori hypothesis. Epidemiological surveys further revealed a latitudinal cline in disease prevalence, with high infection rates in northern host populations decreasing gradually toward the south. Studies of the fitness effects of disease demonstrated that rust infection caused significant reductions in host survival and fecundity, and there was evidence of a demographic feedback between infection prevalence and host density across survey years.

TI Dispersal pathways, seed rains, and the dynamics of larval behavior
AB Dispersing propagules (larvae, seeds, and spores) establish and maintain populations, which serve as templates for subsequent species interactions. Connectivity among demes derives, in large part, from connectivity between consecutive steps, release, transport, and settlement, in dispersal pathways. Concurrent measurements of individuals in each step are a necessary precursor to identifying governing mechanisms. Here we directly and definitively resolved the roles of physics and behavior in mediating dispersal pathways of an estuarine parasite between its intermediate hosts. Planktonic cercariae of Himasthla rhigedana, a parasitic flatworm, are functionally similar to lecithotrophic larvae of many free-living marine invertebrates. The combination of parasite life cycle characteristics and the relatively simple tidal flows in their habitat renders this system an effective model for dispersal studies.
   Simultaneous field measurements of larval release, transport, settlement, and the flow regime, together with mechanistic experiments, led to empirical understanding of host colonization. All dispersal steps were highly and significantly correlated over time and in space. This tight coupling resulted, unequivocally, from a suite of larval behaviors. Cercariae emerged from first intermediate host snails only during daytime flood tides, enhancing larval retention in the marsh. Daylight triggered downward swimming, and within seconds, cercariae overpowered turbulent mixing, landing in benthic habitat of second intermediate host snails and crabs. Larvae settled (encysted) on external regions of snails/crabs that, presumably, were most vulnerable to ingestion by definitive host shorebirds. In total, cercarial behaviors greatly foreshortened dispersal distances, magnified local parasite prevalence, and increased the likelihood of large-scale transmission by definitive hosts. Cracking open the black box of dispersal thus revealed mechanisms, connectivity, and ecological consequences of the larval stage.

TI Local adaptation and maladaptation to pollinators in a generalist
   geographic mosaic
AB The Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution predicts the occurrence of mosaics of interaction-mediated local adaptations and maladaptations. Empirical support to this prediction has come mostly from specialist interactions. In contrast, local adaptation is considered highly unlikely in generalist interactions. In this study, we experimentally test local adaptation in a generalist plant-pollinator geographic mosaic, by means of a transplant experiment in which plants coming from two evolutionary hotspots and two coldspots were offered to pollinators at the same four localities. Plants produced in the hotspots attracted more pollinators in all populations, whereas coldspot plants attracted fewer pollinators in all populations. Differences in adaptation were not related to genetic similarity between populations, suggesting that it was mainly due to spatial variation in previous selective regimes. Our experiment provides the first strong support for a spatially structured pattern of adaptation and maladaptation generated by a generalist free-living mutualism.

TI Increased Host Species Diversity and Decreased Prevalence of Sin Nombre
   Virus
AB Emerging outbreaks of zoonotic diseases are affecting humans at an alarming rate. Until the ecological factors associated with zoonoses are better understood, disease emergence will continue. For Lyme disease, disease suppression has been demonstrated by a dilution effect, whereby increasing species diversity decreases disease prevalence in host populations. To test the dilution effect in another disease, we examined 17 ecological variables associated with prevalence of the directly transmitted Sin Nombre virus (genus Hantavirus, etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in its wildlife host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Only species diversity was statistically linked to infection prevalence: as species diversity decreased, infection prevalence increased. The increase was moderate, but prevalence increased exponentially at low levels of diversity, a phenomenon described as zoonotic release. The results suggest that species diversity affects disease emergence.

AB We determined the prevalence of infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) among small mammals in northern Italy and analyzed long-term dynamics of LCMV in a rodent population in the province of Trento. LCMV is circulating among the most widespread and common wild rodent species in this area (Apodemus flavicollis, Myodes glareolus, and Microtus arvalis); overall prevalence is 6.8%. During 2000-2006, intensive monitoring of LCMV in a population of yellow-necked mice (A. flavicollis) showed a positive correlation between prevalence of infection and rodent density. At the individual level, weight and sex appeared to correlate with antibody prevalence, which suggests that horizontal transmission of LCMV occurs principally among heavier, older males and occurs during fighting. Isolation and genetic characterization of this virus will be the crucial next steps for a better understanding of its ecology.

TI Infectious Disease in a Warming World: How Weather Influenced West Nile
   Virus in the United States (2001-2005)
AB BACKGROUND: The effects of weather on West Nile virus (WNV) mosquito populations in the United States have been widely reported, but few studies assess their overall impact on transmission to humans.
   OBJECTIVES: We investigated meteorologic conditions associated with reported human WNV cases in the United States.
   METHODS: We conducted a case-crossover study to assess 16,298 human WNV cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2001 to 2005. The primary outcome measures were the incidence rate ratio of disease occurrence associated with mean weekly maximum temperature, cumulative weekly temperature, mean weekly dew point temperature, cumulative weekly precipitation, and the presence of I day of heavy rainfall (>= 50 mm) during the month prior to symptom onset.
   RESULTS: Increasing weekly maximum temperature and weekly cumulative temperature were similarly and significantly associated with a 35-83% higher incidence of reported WNV infection over the next month. An increase in mean weekly dew point temperature was significantly associated with a 9-38% higher incidence over the subsequent 3 weeks. The presence of at least I day of heavy rainfall within a week was associated with a 29-66% higher incidence during the same week and over the subsequent 2 weeks. A 20-mm increase in cumulative weekly precipitation was significantly associated with a 4-8% increase in incidence of reported WNV infection over the subsequent 2 weeks.
   CONCLUSIONS: Warmer temperatures, elevated humidity, and heavy precipitation increased the rate of human WNV infection in the United States independent of season and each others' effects.

TI Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections in sheep and goats a review of
   the potential for transmission to humans via environmental contamination
AB The public health significance of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis in sheep is currently unclear. Some research suggests that they are probably not an important zoonotic reservoir, whilst other research indicates this potential exists, and some outbreaks have also been associated with infections in sheep. Actions to limit water supply contamination by sheep have sometimes been severe, occasionally creating problems between farming and public health communities. Here our knowledge on these parasites in both sheep and goats is reviewed; although direct evidence of transmission to humans via water supply contamination is limited, the data accrued indicate that this is a real possibility. As cryptosporidiosis in sheep is generally more prevalent than giardiasis, and species/genotypes of Cryptosporidium infections in sheep are likely to be infectious to humans, this parasite may be considered the greater threat. Nevertheless, geographical variation in prevalence and genotypic distribution is extensive and as measures to limit sheep grazing can have a highly negative impact, it is important that cases are judged individually. If water contamination froth a particular population of sheep/goats is suspected, then suitable investigations should be instigated, investigating both prevalence and species/genotype, before precautionary measures are imposed.

TI THE COST OF BEING COMMON: EVIDENCE FROM NATURAL DAPHNIA POPULATIONS
AB The Red Queen coevolutionary hypothesis predicts that parasites drive oscillations in host genotype frequencies due to frequency-dependent selection where common hosts are at disadvantage. However, examples of this phenomenon in natural populations are scarce. To examine if the Red Queen theory operates in the wild, we studied the genetic structure of populations of the crustacean waterflea (Daphnia), in relation to their infection levels, for which we collected multiple samples from a variety of lakes. The most common clone in a given population was often underinfected. This advantage, however, did not remain stable over time. Instead, the most common clone decreased in frequency over subsequent generations, indicating that parasites can track common clones. Such decreases were not observed in uninfected populations. Moreover, host clonal evenness was higher across the set of infected lakes compared to uninfected lakes; suggesting that any common clone is selected against when parasites are present. These results strongly suggest that Red Queen dynamics do operate in the wild.

TI Social group size affects Mycobacterium bovis infection in European
   badgers (Meles meles)
AB In most social animals, the prevalence of directly transmitted pathogens increases in larger groups and at higher population densities. Such patterns are predicted by models of Mycobacterium bovis infection in European badgers (Meles meles).
   We investigated the relationship between badger abundance and M. bovis prevalence, using data on 2696 adult badgers in 10 populations sampled at the start of the Randomized Badger Culling Trial.
   M. bovis prevalence was consistently higher at low badger densities and in small social groups. M. bovis prevalence was also higher among badgers whose genetic profiles suggested that they had immigrated into their assigned social groups.
   The association between high M. bovis prevalence and small badger group size appeared not to have been caused by previous small-scale culling in study areas, which had been suspended, on average, 5 years before the start of the current study.
   The observed pattern of prevalence might occur through badgers in smaller groups interacting more frequently with members of neighbouring groups; detailed behavioural data are needed to test this hypothesis. Likewise, longitudinal data are needed to determine whether the size of infected groups might be suppressed by disease-related mortality.
   Although M. bovis prevalence was lower at high population densities, the absolute number of infected badgers was higher. However, this does not necessarily mean that the risk of M. bovis transmission to cattle is highest at high badger densities, since transmission risk depends on badger behaviour as well as on badger density.

TI Long-Term Benefit of Hepatitis B Vaccination among Children in Thailand
   with Transient Hepatitis B Virus Infection Who Were Born to Hepatitis B
   Surface Antigen-Positive Mothers
AB Background. Transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from carrier mothers to their babies appears to be one of the most important factors influencing the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in areas of high hepatitis B endemicity.
   Methods. Infants born to HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers who were or were not positive for HBV e antigen (HBeAg) or to mothers who were negative for both HBsAg and HBeAg have been followed for 17 years for serological evidence of HBV infection. These infants were divided into 2 groups on the basis of their hepatitis B vaccination protocols: group 1 received vaccine at birth and 1, 2, and 12 months later, and group 2 received vaccine at birth and 1 and 6 months later. Follow-up involved annual clinic visits, during which a blood sample was taken and analyzed for the presence of HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg, and antibody to HBV core antigen (HBcAg). Selected blood samples that tested positive for HBV markers during >= 2 consecutive visits separated by a long interval were further investigated by polymerase chain reaction to detect HBV DNA.
   Results. Transient presence of HBsAg or transient and/or long-term presence of antibody to HBcAg suggested that this population was heavily exposed to HBV during the follow-up period. Despite these findings, no new cases of chronic HBV infection were observed. None of the subjects with transient presence of HBsAg had any clinical symptoms of liver disease.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrates the efficacy of the HBV vaccine and its ability to protect against symptomatic disease.

AB Background. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is prevalent and causes disease worldwide, but its epidemiological profile is only partially understood.
   Methods. We used an enzyme immunoassay to measure anti-HEV immunoglobulin G antibodies in 18,695 serum samples collected in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We calculated estimates of HEV seroprevalence and examined associations with putative risk factors.
   Results. The seroprevalence of HEV in the civilian noninstitutionalized United States (US) population during the period from 1988 through 1994 was 21.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.0%-22.9%). Among US-born individuals, males, non-Hispanic whites, and individuals residing in the Midwest and/or in metropolitan areas had the highest seroprevalence estimates. Having a pet in the home (odds ratio [OR], 1.19 [95% CI, 1.01-1.40]) and consuming liver or other organ meats more than once per month (OR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.01-1.88]) were significantly associated with increased odds of HEV seropositivity.
   Conclusions. Exposure to HEV is common in the US population, although hepatitis E is rarely reported. Having pets and consuming organ meats may play a role in HEV transmission in the United States, but other mechanisms of transmission may also exist. HEV may be considered a possible etiologic agent of acute and chronic hepatitis in US patients reporting no travel history.

TI Methamphetamine Enhances Histoplasmosis by Immunosuppression of the Host
AB The effect of methamphetamine on the host response to an opportunistic pathogen has not been extensively described. Methamphetamine is a major public health and safety problem in the United States. Chronic methamphetamine abuse is associated with a 2-fold higher risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection and, possibly, additional infections. Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that is endemic in the Midwest of the United States and that causes respiratory and systemic disease, particularly in individuals with impaired immunity. We showed that methamphetamine abrogates normal macrophage function, resulting in an inability to control histoplasmosis. Methamphetamine decreased phagocytosis and killing of yeast by primary macrophages by alkalization of the phagosome. Furthermore, mice that received methamphetamine prior to H. capsulatum infection were immunologically impaired, with increased fungal burden, increased pulmonary inflammation, and decreased survival. Immunosuppression by methamphetamine may be associated with deregulation of cytokines in the lungs of infected mice, aberrant processing of H. capsulatum within macrophages, and immobilization of MAC-1 receptors on the surface of macrophages that are involved in phagocytosis. Additionally, methamphetamine inhibits T cell proliferation and alters antibody production, which are important components of adaptive immunity. With use of a murine model of histoplasmosis, this study establishes that methamphetamine may alter the immune system of the host and enhance fungal pathogenesis.

TI Spatial Ecology of Raccoons Related to Cattle and Bovine Tuberculosis in
   Northeastern Michigan
AB In 1995, Mycobacterium bovis, the causative bacterium of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), was detected in 5 beef cattle operations in Alcona County, Michigan, USA. In accordance with Federal law, the operations were depopulated to prevent the spread of bTB. Subsequent wildlife surveillance programs identified high prevalence of M. bovis in mesocarnivores, including raccoons (Procyon lotor), which suggested that raccoons may be complicit in vectoring the pathogen among livestock operations. Our goal was to develop an empirical basis for generating hypotheses about the likelihood for raccoons to mediate the transmission of bTB to livestock. We found intersexual differences in scale-dependent resource selection and probability of spatial interaction that, under certain circumstances, may form the foundation for a sex-bias in disease transmission. Spatial dispersion of mixed-forest patches facilitated overlap of adjacent males, whereas female overlap zones included pastures. Within overlap zones, probabilities of interaction for male-male and male-female dyads were greater than for female-female dyads, although we documented an elevated likelihood of spatial interaction between raccoons and livestock around cattle-feeding troughs and water sources, regardless of sex. Partial regressions generated by linear models indicated that distance between nearest-neighbor mixed-forest patches explained most of this observed variation. These results supported our prediction that forest patches juxtaposed with anthropogenic features fostered social tolerance between males and, thus, facilitated spatial interaction and exploitation of anthropogenic features. In raccoons, sex and landscape composition influenced pathogen transmission potential. We suggest that livestock producers locate livestock feeding and watering features away from forest patches to mitigate future outbreaks of bTB in endemic areas.

TI Mechanisms of avoidance of host immunity by Neisseria meningitidis and
   its effect on vaccine development
AB Neisseria meningitidis remains an important cause of severe sepsis and meningitis worldwide. The bacterium is only found in human hosts, and so must continually coexist with the immune system. Consequently, N meningitidis uses multiple mechanisms to avoid being killed by antimicrobial proteins, phagocytes, and, crucially, the complement system. Much remains to be learnt about the strategies N meningitidis employs to evade aspects of immune killing, including mimicry of host molecules by bacterial structures such as capsule and lipopolysaccharide, which poses substantial problems for vaccine design. To date, available vaccines only protect individuals against subsets of meningococcal strains. However, two promising vaccines are currently being assessed in clinical trials and appear to offer good prospects for an effective means of protecting individuals against endemic serogroup B disease, which has proven to be a major challenge in vaccine research.

TI Genetic structure and population dynamics of a heteroecious plant
   pathogen Melampsora larici-epitea in short-rotation coppice willow
   plantations
AB Complex life strategies are common among plant pathogens belonging to rust fungi (Uredinales). The heteroecious willow rust Melampsora larici-epitea produces five spore stages and alternates on larch (Larix). To shed light on the epidemiology of this pathogen, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to determine the genetic diversity and genetic structure of rust samples collected from coppice willow (Salix) plantations at three UK sites (LA, CA and MC) over three sampling dates (September 2000, July 2001 and September 2001). Of the total of 819 isolates, 465 were unique AFLP phenotypes and there was a shift in genotype diversity between the two seasons (0.67 in 2000 and 0.87-0.89 in 2001). No phenotypes were common between the two seasons within a site, suggesting that the rust did not overwinter as an asexual stage within plantations. A temporal analysis detected large amounts of genetic drift (F-S = 0.15-0.26) between the two seasons and very small effective population sizes (N-e = 2-3) within sites. These results all point to a new colonization of the plantations by the rust in the second season (2001). The F-ST-analogue values were Theta(CT) = 0.121, Weir and Cockerham's theta = 0.086 and the Bayesian estimate theta(B) = 0.087-0.096. The results suggest that the sources of inoculum were somewhat localized and the same sources were mainly responsible for disease epidemics in LA and CA over the two seasons. The relatively low F-ST-values among sites (0.055-0.13) suggest the existence of significant gene flow among the three sampled sites.

TI Assessment of Yellow Fever Epidemic Risk: An Original Multi-criteria
   Modeling Approach
AB Background: Yellow fever (YF) virtually disappeared in francophone West African countries as a result of YF mass vaccination campaigns carried out between 1940 and 1953. However, because of the failure to continue mass vaccination campaigns, a resurgence of the deadly disease in many African countries began in the early 1980s. We developed an original modeling approach to assess YF epidemic risk (vulnerability) and to prioritize the populations to be vaccinated.
   Methods and Findings: We chose a two-step assessment of vulnerability at district level consisting of a quantitative and qualitative assessment per country. Quantitative assessment starts with data collection on six risk factors: five risk factors associated with "exposure'' to virus/vector and one with "susceptibility'' of a district to YF epidemics. The multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) modeling method was specifically adapted to reduce the five exposure variables to one aggregated exposure indicator. Health districts were then projected onto a two-dimensional graph to define different levels of vulnerability. Districts are presented on risk maps for qualitative analysis in consensus groups, allowing the addition of factors, such as population migrations or vector density, that could not be included in MCA. The example of rural districts in Burkina Faso show five distinct clusters of risk profiles. Based on this assessment, 32 of 55 districts comprising over 7 million people were prioritized for preventive vaccination campaigns.
   Conclusion: This assessment of yellow fever epidemic risk at the district level includes MCA modeling and consensus group modification. MCA provides a standardized way to reduce complexity. It supports an informed public health decision-making process that empowers local stakeholders through the consensus group. This original approach can be applied to any disease with documented risk factors.

TI The Role of Human Movement in the Transmission of Vector-Borne Pathogens
AB Background: Human movement is a key behavioral factor in many vector-borne disease systems because it influences exposure to vectors and thus the transmission of pathogens. Human movement transcends spatial and temporal scales with different influences on disease dynamics. Here we develop a conceptual model to evaluate the importance of variation in exposure due to individual human movements for pathogen transmission, focusing on mosquito-borne dengue virus.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We develop a model showing that the relevance of human movement at a particular scale depends on vector behavior. Focusing on the day-biting Aedes aegypti, we illustrate how vector biting behavior combined with fine-scale movements of individual humans engaged in their regular daily routine can influence transmission. Using a simple example, we estimate a transmission rate (R(0)) of 1.3 when exposure is assumed to occur only in the home versus 3.75 when exposure at multiple locations-e. g., market, friend's-due to movement is considered. Movement also influences for which sites and individuals risk is greatest. For the example considered, intriguingly, our model predicts little correspondence between vector abundance in a site and estimated R(0) for that site when movement is considered. This illustrates the importance of human movement for understanding and predicting the dynamics of a disease like dengue. To encourage investigation of human movement and disease, we review methods currently available to study human movement and, based on our experience studying dengue in Peru, discuss several important questions to address when designing a study.
   Conclusions/Significance: Human movement is a critical, understudied behavioral component underlying the transmission dynamics of many vector-borne pathogens. Understanding movement will facilitate identification of key individuals and sites in the transmission of pathogens such as dengue, which then may provide targets for surveillance, intervention, and improved disease prevention.

TI Feasibility, Drug Safety, and Effectiveness of Etiological Treatment
   Programs for Chagas Disease in Honduras, Guatemala, and Bolivia: 10-Year
   Experience of Medecins Sans Frontieres
AB Background: Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is a zoonotic or anthropozoonotic disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Predominantly affecting populations in poor areas of Latin America, medical care for this neglected disease is often lacking. Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has provided diagnostic and treatment services for Chagas disease since 1999. This report describes 10 years of field experience in four MSF programs in Honduras, Guatemala, and Bolivia, focusing on feasibility protocols, safety of drug therapy, and treatment effectiveness.
   Methodology: From 1999 to 2008, MSF provided free diagnosis, etiological treatment, and follow-up care for patients,18 years of age seropositive for T. cruzi in Yoro, Honduras (1999-2002); Olopa, Guatemala (2003-2006); Entre Rios, Bolivia (2002-2006); and Sucre, Bolivia (2005-2008). Essential program components guaranteeing feasibility of implementation were information, education, and communication (IEC) at the community and family level; vector control; health staff training; screening and diagnosis; treatment and compliance, including family-based strategies for early detection of adverse events; and logistics. Chagas disease diagnosis was confirmed by testing blood samples using two different diagnostic tests. T. cruzi-positive patients were treated with benznidazole as first-line treatment, with appropriate counseling, consent, and active participation from parents or guardians for daily administration of the drug, early detection of adverse events, and treatment withdrawal, when necessary. Weekly follow-up was conducted, with adverse events recorded to assess drug safety. Evaluations of serological conversion were carried out to measure treatment effectiveness. Vector control, entomological surveillance, and health education activities were carried out in all projects with close interaction with national and regional programs.
   Results: Total numbers of children and adolescents tested for T. cruzi in Yoro, Olopa, Entre Rios, and Sucre were 24,471, 8,927, 7,613, and 19,400, respectively. Of these, 232 (0.9%), 124 (1.4%), 1,475 (19.4%), and 1,145 (5.9%) patients, respectively, were diagnosed as seropositive. Patients were treated with benznidazole, and early findings of seroconversion varied widely between the Central and South American programs: 87.1% and 58.1% at 18 months post-treatment in Yoro and Olopa, respectively; 5.4% by up to 60 months in Entre Rios; and 0% at an average of 18 months in Sucre. Benznidazole-related adverse events were observed in 50.2% and 50.8% of all patients treated in Yoro and Olopa, respectively, and 25.6% and 37.9% of patients in Entre Rios and Sucre, respectively. Most adverse events were mild and manageable. No deaths occurred in the treatment population.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing Chagas disease diagnosis and treatment programs in resource-limited settings, including remote rural areas, while addressing the limitations associated with drug-related adverse events. The variability in apparent treatment effectiveness may reflect differences in patient and parasite populations, and illustrates the limitations of current treatments and measures of efficacy. New treatments with improved safety profiles, pediatric formulations of existing and new drugs, and a faster, reliable test of cure are all urgently needed.

TI Dynamics and Control of Infections Transmitted From Person to Person
   Through the Environment
AB The environment provides points for control of pathogens spread by food, water, hands, air, or fomites. These environmental transmission pathways require contact network formulations more realistically detailed than those based on social encounters or physical proximity. As a step toward improved assessment of environmental interventions, description of contact networks, and better use of environmental specimens to analyze transmission, an environmental infection transmission system model that describes the dynamics of human interaction with pathogens in the environment is presented. Its environmental parameters include the pathogen elimination rate, mu, and the rate humans pick up pathogens, , and deposit them, alpha. The ratio, N/mu (N equals population size), indicates whether transmission is density dependent (low ratio), frequency dependent (high ratio), or in between. Transmission through frequently touched fomites, such as doorknobs, generates frequency-dependent patterns, while transmission through thoroughly mixed air or infrequently touched fomites generates density-dependent patterns. The environmental contamination ratio, alpha/gamma, reflects total agent deposition per infection and outbreak probability, where gamma is defined as the recovery rate. These insights provide theoretical contexts to examine the role of the environment in pathogen transmission and a framework to interpret environmental data to inform environmental interventions.

TI DNA Vaccination with a Single-Plasmid Construct Coding for Viruslike
   Particles Protects Mice against Infection with a Highly Pathogenic Avian
   Influenza A Virus
AB Background. With seasonal outbreaks affecting millions of people each year and devastating pandemics, human influenza is a major health concern. The pandemic threat includes highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) that gained the ability to infect humans in Asia and quickly spread throughout the world. Major concerns have been raised regarding today's vaccine production systems against influenza viruses, and new strategies to design efficient vaccines are under intensive investigation.
   Methods. We demonstrated elsewhere that viruslike particles (VLPs) incorporating HPAIV hemagglutinin induce strong humoral immune response when injected in mice. In the current study, we evaluated a novel strategy that combines the immunogenicity of influenza VLPs and the advantages of DNA vaccines.
   Results. We developed minimal expression vectors encoding all genetic information necessary to produce H7N1 influenza VLPs. We showed that mice vaccinated with small DNA amounts developed specific, high-titer neutralizing antibodies against homologous H7N1 strain and were protected against lethal doses of an antigenically distinct H7N7 HPAIV. Moreover, using some of these constructs, we were able to raise cross-neutralizing antibodies against an unrelated H5N1 HPAIV.
   Conclusions. DNA vaccination with constructs coding for influenza VLP production is a promising strategy to induce protection against different influenza viruses.

TI No sex in fungus-farming ants or their crops
AB Asexual reproduction imposes evolutionary handicaps on asexual species, rendering them prone to extinction, because asexual reproduction generates novel genotypes and purges deleterious mutations at lower rates than sexual reproduction. Here, we report the first case of complete asexuality in ants, the fungus-growing ant Mycocepurus smithii, where queens reproduce asexually but workers are sterile, which is doubly enigmatic because the clonal colonies of M. smithii also depend on clonal fungi for food. Degenerate female mating anatomy, extensive field and laboratory surveys, and DNA fingerprinting implicate complete asexuality in this widespread ant species. Maternally inherited bacteria (e. g. Wolbachia, Cardinium) and the fungal cultivars can be ruled out as agents inducing asexuality. M. smithii societies of clonal females provide a unique system to test theories of parent-offspring conflict and reproductive policing in social insects. Asexuality of both ant farmer and fungal crop challenges traditional views proposing that sexual farmer ants outpace coevolving sexual crop pathogens, and thus compensate for vulnerabilities of their asexual crops. Either the double asexuality of both farmer and crop may permit the host to fully exploit advantages of asexuality for unknown reasons or frequent switching between crops (symbiont reassociation) generates novel ant-fungus combinations, which may compensate for any evolutionary handicaps of asexuality in M. smithii.

TI Environmental and Biological Factors Influencing Culex pipiens
   quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) Vector Competence for Saint
   Louis Encephalitis Virus
AB Complex interactions between environmental and biological factors influence the susceptibility of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus to St. Louis encephalitis virus and could affect the epidemiology of virus transmission. Similar interactions Could have epidemiologic implications for other vector-virus systems. We conducted an experiment to examine four such factors in combination: mosquito age, extrinsic incubation temperature (EIT), virus dose, and colony The proportion of mosquitoes with body infections or disseminated infections varied between colonies, and was dependant oil age, EIT, and dose. We also show that the probability of a body or leg infection interacted in complex ways between colonies, ages, EITs. and doses. The complex interactive effects of environmental and biological factors Must be taken into account for studies of vector competence and epidemiology, especially when laboratory studies are used to generalize to natural transmission dynamics where the extent of variation is largely unknown.

TI Dengue Transmission in the Small-Island Setting: Investigations from the

AB The Caribbean region has experienced a major Surge in dengue activity in recent decades. Yet, for many, and especially the smaller islands, the true extent and general epidemiology of dengue transmission remains unclear because of inadequate systems of surveillance and reporting. We established an active surveillance system supported by laboratory-based diagnosis on the small island of Grenada, from January 2001 through June 2002. The surveillance data provided evidence of three distinct modes of disease dynamics in the form of low endemic, pre-epidemic, and overt epidemic transmission of mostly benign dengue fever. A shift in serotype activity and modal age was evident during the noted transition, with the more densely populated south end of the island presenting the focus of transmission.

TI Resource Ecology of Virulence in a Planktonic Host-Parasite System: An
   Explanation Using Dynamic Energy Budgets
AB Parasites steal resources that a host would otherwise direct toward its own growth and reproduction. We use this fundamental notion to explain resource-dependent virulence in a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia)-zooplankton host (Daphnia) system and in a variety of other disease systems with invertebrate hosts. In an experiment, well-fed hosts died faster and produced more parasites than did austerely fed ones. This resource-dependent variation in virulence and other experimental results (involving growth and reproduction rate/timing of hosts) readily emerged from a model based on dynamic energy budgets. This model follows energy flow through the host, from ingestion of food, to internal energy storage, to allocation toward growth and reproduction or to a parasite that consumes these reserves. Acting as a consumer, the parasite catalyzes its own extinction, persistence with an energetically compromised host, or death of the host. In this last case, more resources for the host inadvertently fuels faster parasite growth, thereby accelerating the demise of the host (although the opposite result arises with different resource kinetics of the parasite). Thus, this model can explain how resource supply drives variation in virulence. This ecological dependence of virulence likely rivals and/or interacts with genetic mechanisms that often garner more attention in the literature on disease.

TI Parasite spillback: A neglected concept in invasion ecology?
AB While there is good evidence linking animal introductions to impacts on native communities via disease emergence, our understanding of how such impacts occur is incomplete. Invasion ecologists have focused on the disease risks to native communities through "spillover'' of infectious agents introduced with nonindigenous hosts, while overlooking a potentially more common mechanism of impact, that of "parasite spillback.'' We hypothesize that parasite spillback could occur when a nonindigenous species is a competent host for a native parasite, with the presence of the additional host increasing disease impacts in native species. Despite its lack of formalization in all recent reviews of the role of parasites in species introductions, aspects of the invasion process actually favor parasite spillback over spillover. We specifically review the animal-parasite literature and show that native species (arthropods, parasitoids, protozoa, and helminths) account for 67% of the parasite fauna of nonindigenous animals from a range of taxonomic groups. We show that nonindigenous species can be highly competent hosts for such parasites and provide evidence that infection by native parasites does spillback from nonindigenous species to native host species, with effects at both the host individual and population scale. We conclude by calling for greater recognition of parasite spillback as a potential threat to native species, discuss possible reasons for its neglect by invasion ecologists, and identify future research directions.

TI Reemerging Rabies and Lack of Systemic Surveillance in People's Republic
   of China
AB Rabies is a reemerging disease in China. The high incidence of rabies leads to numerous concerns: a potential carrier-dog phenomenon, undocumented transmission of rabies virus from wildlife to dogs, counterfeit vaccines, vaccine mismatching, and seroconversion testing in patients after their completion of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). These concerns are all scientifically arguable given a modern understanding of rabies. Rabies reemerges periodically in China because of high dog population density and low vaccination coverage in dogs. Mass vaccination campaigns rather than depopulation of dogs should be a long-term goal for rabies control. Seroconversion testing after vaccination is not necessary in either humans or animals. Human PEP should be initiated on the basis of diagnosis of biting animals. Reliable national systemic surveillance of rabies-related human deaths and of animal rabies prevalence is urgently needed. A laboratory diagnosis-based epidemiologic surveillance system can provide substantial information about disease transmission and effective prevention strategies.

TI Slave Trade and Hepatitis B Virus Genotypes and Subgenotypes in Haiti
   and Africa
AB In Haiti, >90% of the population descended from African slaves. Of 7,147 Haitian pregnant women sampled, 44% of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections were caused by genotype A1, which today is found mainly in eastern Africa. Twenty percent belong to a rare subgenotype, A5, which has been found only in the former Bight of Benin, a former primary slave trading post. Haitian A subgenotypes appear to have separated early from the African subgenotypes; the most prevalent genotype and subgenotype in West Africa today (E and A3, respectively) are rare in Haiti. This difference indicates that the dominant subgenotypes in Africa emerged in the general population only after the slave trade and explains the low genetic diversity of genotype E. The high prevalence of HBV genotype E in much of Africa further suggests that HBV hyperendemicity is a recent phenomenon, probably resulting from extensive use of unsafe needles.

We identified 23 introductions of Nipah virus into human populations in central and northwestern Bangladesh from 2001 through 2007. Ten introductions affected multiple persons (median 10). Illness onset occurred from December through May but not every year. We identified 122 cases of human Nipah infection. The mean age of case-patients was 27 years; 87 (71%) died. In 62 (51%) Nipah virus-infected patients, illness developed 5-15 days after close contact with another Nipah case-patient. Nine (7%) Nipah case-patients transmitted virus to others. Nipah case-patients who had difficulty breathing were more likely than those without respiratory difficulty to transmit Nipah (12% vs. 0%, p = 0.03). Although a small minority of infected patients transmit Nipah virus, more than half of identified cases result from person-to-person transmission. Interventions to prevent virus transmission from bats to humans and from person to person are needed.

AB Historical studies of influenza pandemics can provide insight into transmission and mortality patterns, and may aid in planning for a future pandemic. Here, we analyse historical vital statistics and quantify the age-specific mortality patterns associated with the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic in Japan, USA, and UK. All three Countries showed highly elevated mortality risk in young adults relative to surrounding non-pandemic years. By contrast, the risk of death was low in the very young and very old. In Japan, the overall mortality impact was not limited to winter 1918-1919, and continued during winter 1919-1920. Mortality impact varied as much as threefold across the 47 Japanese prefectures, and differences in baseline mortality, population demographics, and density explained a small fraction of these variations. Our study highlights important geographical variations in timing and mortality impact of historical pandemics, in particular between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. In a future pandemic, vaccination in one region could save lives even months after the emergence of a pandemic virus in another region.

TI Life cycle abbreviation in trematode parasites and the developmental
   time hypothesis: is the clock ticking?
AB The typical multi-host life cycle of many parasites, although conferring several advantages, presents the parasites with a highly hazardous transmission route. As a consequence, parasites have evolved various adaptations increasing their chances of transmission between the different hosts of the life cycle. Some trematode species like the opecoelid Coitocaecum parvum have adopted a more drastic alternative strategy whereby the definitive host is facultatively dropped from the cycle, resulting in a shorter, hence easier to complete, life cycle. Like other species capable of abbreviating their life cycle, C. parvum does so through progenetic development within its intermediate host. Laboratory-reared C. parvum can modulate their developmental strategy inside the second intermediate host according to current transmission opportunities, though this ability is not apparent in natural C. parvum populations. Here we show that this difference is likely due to the time C. parvum individuals spend in their intermediate hosts in the natural environment. Although transmission opportunities, i.e. chemical cues of the presence of definitive hosts, promoted the adoption of a truncated life cycle in the early stages of infection, individuals that remained in their amphipod host for a relatively long time had a similar probability of adopting progenesis and the abbreviated cycle, regardless of the presence or absence of chemical cues from the predator definitive host. These results support the developmental time hypothesis which states that parasites capable of facultative life cycle abbreviation should eventually adopt progenesis regardless of transmission opportunities, and provide further evidence of the adaptive plasticity of parasite transmission strategies.

TI Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) Seroprevalence in
   Population-Based Samples of African Children: Evidence for At Least 2
   Patterns of KSHV Transmission
AB Background. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV) infection is endemic among adult populations in Africa. A prevailing view is that childhood transmission is primarily responsible for the high seroprevalence of KSHV among adults that is observed throughout the continent. However, few studies have directly examined children, particularly in locations where KS is not commonly endemic.
   Methods. Participants were children aged 1.5-8.9 years, including 427 children from a population-based sample in South Africa, 422 from a population-based sample in Uganda, and 567 from a clinic-based sample in Uganda. All serum specimens were tested by the same laboratory for KSHV antibodies with use of 2 enzyme immunoassays (against K8.1 and ORF65) and 1 immunofluorescence assay.
   Results. KSHV seroprevalence was 7.5%-9.0% among South African children and was not associated with age. In contrast, in the Ugandan population-based sample, KSHV seroprevalence increased from 10% among 2-year-old children to 30.6% among 8-year-old children (P(trend) <.001). In the Ugandan clinic-based sample, sero-prevalence increased from 9.3% among 2-year-old children to 36.4% among 8-year-old children (P(trend) <.001). trend
   Conclusion. Two distinct relationships between age and KSHV infection among children imply that KSHV transmission among children is not uniform throughout Africa and is therefore not always responsible for the high seroprevalence observed in adults. There are at least 2 patterns of KSHV transmission in Africa.

TI Red Queen Dynamics with Non-Standard Fitness Interactions
AB Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites can involve rapid fluctuations of genotype frequencies that are known as Red Queen dynamics. Under such dynamics, recombination in the hosts may be advantageous because genetic shuffling can quickly produce disproportionately fit offspring (the Red Queen hypothesis). Previous models investigating these dynamics have assumed rather simple models of genetic interactions between hosts and parasites. Here, we assess the robustness of earlier theoretical predictions about the Red Queen with respect to the underlying host-parasite interactions. To this end, we created large numbers of random interaction matrices, analysed the resulting dynamics through simulation, and ascertained whether recombination was favoured or disfavoured. We observed Red Queen dynamics in many of our simulations provided the interaction matrices exhibited sufficient 'antagonicity'. In agreement with previous studies, strong selection on either hosts or parasites favours selection for increased recombination. However, fast changes in the sign of linkage disequilibrium or epistasis were only infrequently observed and do not appear to be a necessary condition for the Red Queen hypothesis to work. Indeed, recombination was often favoured even though the linkage disequilibrium remained of constant sign throughout the simulations. We conclude that Red Queen-type dynamics involving persistent fluctuations in host and parasite genotype frequencies appear to not be an artefact of specific assumptions about host-parasite fitness interactions, but emerge readily with the general interactions studied here. Our results also indicate that although recombination is often favoured, some of the factors previously thought to be important in this process such as linkage disequilibrium fluctuations need to be reassessed when fitness interactions between hosts and parasites are complex.

TI Microarray Comparative Genomic Hybridisation Analysis Incorporating
   Genomic Organisation, and Application to Enterobacterial Plant Pathogens
AB Microarray comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) provides an estimate of the relative abundance of genomic DNA (gDNA) taken from comparator and reference organisms by hybridisation to a microarray containing probes that represent sequences from the reference organism. The experimental method is used in a number of biological applications, including the detection of human chromosomal aberrations, and in comparative genomic analysis of bacterial strains, but optimisation of the analysis is desirable in each problem domain. We present a method for analysis of bacterial aCGH data that encodes spatial information from the reference genome in a hidden Markov model. This technique is the first such method to be validated in comparisons of sequenced bacteria that diverge at the strain and at the genus level: Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043 (Pba1043) and Dickeya dadantii 3937 (Dda3937); and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363. In all cases our method is found to outperform common and widely used aCGH analysis methods that do not incorporate spatial information. This analysis is applied to comparisons between commercially important plant pathogenic soft-rotting enterobacteria (SRE) Pba1043, P. atrosepticum SCRI1039, P. carotovorum 193, and Dda3937. Our analysis indicates that it should not be assumed that hybridisation strength is a reliable proxy for sequence identity in aCGH experiments, and robustly extends the applicability of aCGH to bacterial comparisons at the genus level. Our results in the SRE further provide evidence for a dynamic, plastic 'accessory' genome, revealing major genomic islands encoding gene products that provide insight into, and may play a direct role in determining, variation amongst the SRE in terms of their environmental survival, host range and aetiology, such as phytotoxin synthesis, multidrug resistance, and nitrogen fixation.

Determinants of DF epidemiology and factors involved in severe cases-dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS)-remain imperfectly characterized. Since 2000, serotype 1 (DENV-1) has predominated in the South Pacific. The aim of this study was (i) to determine the origin and (ii) to study the evolutionary relationships of DENV-1 viruses that have circulated in French Polynesia (FP) from the severe 2001 outbreak to the recent 2006 epidemic, and (iii) to analyse the viral intra-host genetic diversity according to clinical presentation.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Sequences of 181 envelope gene and 12 complete polyproteins of DENV-1 viruses obtained from human sera in FP during the 2001-2006 period were generated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all DENV-1 FP strains belonged to genotype IV-"South Pacific'' and derived from a single introduction event from South-East Asia followed by a 6-year in situ evolution. Although the ratio of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitutions per site indicated strong negative selection, a mutation in the envelope glycoprotein (S222T) appeared in 2002 and was subsequently fixed. It was noted that genetic diversification was very significant during the 2002-2005 period of endemic DENV-1 circulation. For nine DF sera and eight DHF/DSS sera, approximately 40 clones/serum of partial envelope gene were sequenced. Importantly, analysis revealed that the intra-host genetic diversity was significantly lower in severe cases than in classical DF.
   Conclusions/Significance: First, this study showed that DENV-1 epidemiology in FP was different from that described in other South-Pacific islands, characterized by a long sustained viral circulation and the absence of new viral introduction over a 6-year period. Second, a significant part of DENV-1 evolution was observed during the endemic period characterized by the rapid fixation of S222T in the envelope protein that may reflect genetic drift or adaptation to the mosquito vector. Third, for the first time, it is suggested that clinical outcome may be correlated with intra-host genetic diversity.

TI Sea lice and salmon population dynamics: effects of exposure time for
   migratory fish
AB The ecological impact of parasite transmission from fish farms is probably mediated by the migration of wild fishes, which determines the period of exposure to parasites. For Pacific salmon and the parasitic sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, analysis of the exposure period may resolve conflicting observations of epizootic mortality in field studies and parasite rejection in experiments. This is because exposure periods can differ by 2-3 orders of magnitude, ranging from months in the field to hours in experiments. We developed a mathematical model of salmon-louse population dynamics, parametrized by a study that monitored naturally infected juvenile salmon held in ocean enclosures. Analysis of replicated trials indicates that lice suffer high mortality, particularly during pre-adult stages. The model suggests louse populations rapidly decline following brief exposure of juvenile salmon, similar to laboratory study designs and data. However, when the exposure period lasts for several weeks, as occurs when juvenile salmon migrate past salmon farms, the model predicts that lice accumulate to abundances that can elevate salmon mortality and depress salmon populations. The duration of parasite exposure is probably critical to salmon-louse population dynamics, and should therefore be accommodated in coastal planning and management where fish farms are situated on wild fish migration routes.

TI Disruption of Tight Junctions by Cellulose Sulfate Facilitates HIV
   Infection: Model of Microbicide Safety
AB Background. The lack of biomarkers that are predictive of safety is a critical gap in the development of microbicides. The present experiments were designed to evaluate the predictive value of in vitro models of microbicide safety.
   Methods. Changes in the epithelial barrier were evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) after exposure of human epithelial cells to candidate microbicides in a dual-chamber system. The significance of observed changes was addressed by challenging cultures with human immuodeficiency virus (HIV) and measuring the ability of virus to cross the epithelium and infect target T cells cultured in the lower chamber.
   Results. Exposure to nonoxynol-9 (N-9) or cellulose sulfate (CS), but not 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (also referred to as tenofovir) or PRO2000, resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in TER and a marked increase in HIV infection of T cells cultured in the lower chamber. Moreover, CS triggered nuclear factor kappa B activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased HIV replication in chronically infected U1 cells.
   Conclusions. Epithelial barrier disruption and enhanced viral replication may have contributed to the increased risk of HIV acquisition observed in phase 3 trials of N-9 and CS. Expansion of in vitro safety testing to include these models would provide a more stringent preclinical assessment of microbicide safety and may prove to be more predictive of clinical outcomes.

TI Essential Role for Neutrophils but not Alveolar Macrophages at Early
   Time Points following Aspergillus fumigatus Infection
AB Alveolar macrophages and neutrophils mediate innate immune defense against the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and are believed to be essential for host survival following inhalation of fungal spores (conidia). Although alveolar macrophages are postulated to kill inhaled conidia and neutrophils are believed to act against hyphae, the relative contribution of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils to early defense against A. fumigatus remain incompletely defined. To more precisely characterize the contributions of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in antifungal host defense, we selectively depleted each cell population at different times following pulmonary challenge with conidia. Mice depleted of alveolar macrophages prior to pulmonary A. fumigatus infection recruited neutrophils normally and restricted hyphal tissue invasion. In contrast, neutrophil depletion prior to or within 3 h after infection was associated with high mortality. Neutrophil depletion at later time points, however, was associated with nearly normal survival rates. Our studies suggest that neutrophils, but not alveolar macrophages, provide essential anticonidial defense and that a brief period of influx into the respiratory tree is sufficient to prevent conidial germination and invasive disease.

TI Transmission of Japanese Encephalitis Virus from the Black Flying Fox,
   Pteropus alecto, to Culex annulirostris Mosquitoes, Despite the Absence
   of Detectable Viremia
AB To determine the potential role of flying foxes in transmission cycles of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in Australia, we exposed Pteropus alecto (Megachiroptera: Pteropididae) to JEV via infected Culex annulirostris mosquitoes or inoculation. No flying foxes developed symptoms consistent with JEV infection. Anti-JEV IgG antibodies developed in 6/10 flying foxes exposed to infected Cx. annulirostris and in 5/5 inoculated flying foxes. Low-level viremia was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 1/5 inoculated flying foxes and this animal was able to infect recipient mosquitoes. Although viremia was not detected in any of the 10 flying foxes that were exposed to JEV by mosquito bite, two animals infected recipient mosquitoes. Likewise, an inoculated flying fox without detectable viremia infected recipient mosquitoes. Although infection rates in recipient mosquitoes were low, the high population densities in roosting camps, coupled with migratory behavior indicate that flying foxes could play a role in the dispersal of JEV.

TI Spatiotemporal Structure of Host-Pathogen Interactions in a
   Metapopulation
AB The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species are influenced by spatiotemporal variation in population size. Unfortunately, we are usually limited in our ability to investigate the numerical dynamics of natural populations across large spatial scales and over long periods of time. Here we combine mechanistic and statistical approaches to reconstruct continuous-time infection dynamics of an obligate fungal pathogen on the basis of discrete-time occurrence data. The pathogen, Podosphaera plantaginis, infects its host plant, Plantago lanceolata, in a metapopulation setting where the presence of the pathogen has been recorded annually for 6 years in similar to 4,000 host populations across an area of 50 km x 70 km in Finland. The dynamics are driven by strong seasonality, with a high extinction rate during winter and epidemic expansion in summer for local pathogen populations. We are able to identify with our model the regions in the study area where overwintering has been most successful. These overwintering sites represent foci that initiate local epidemics during the growing season. There is striking heterogeneity at the regional scale in both the overwintering success of the pathogen and the encounter intensity between the host and the pathogen. Such heterogeneity has profound implications for the coevolutionary dynamics of the interaction.

TI Fitting Models of Multiple Hypotheses to Partial Population Data:
   Investigating the Causes of Cycles in Red Grouse
AB There are two postulated causes for the observed periodic fluctuations (cycles) in red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus). The first involves interaction with the parasitic nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis. The second invokes delayed regulation through the effect of male aggressiveness on territoriality. Empirical evidence exists to support both hypotheses, and each hypothesis has been modeled deterministically. However, little effort has gone into looking at the combined effects of the two mechanisms or formally fitting the corresponding models to field data. Here we present a model for red grouse dynamics that includes both parasites and territoriality. To explore the single and combined hypotheses, we specify three versions of this model and fit them to data using Bayesian state-space modeling, a method that allows statistical inference to be performed on mechanistic models such as ours. Output from the three models is then examined to determine their goodness of fit and the biological plausibility of the parameter values required by each to fit the population data. While all three models are capable of emulating the observed cyclic dynamics, only the model including both aggression and parasites does so under consistently realistic parameter values, providing theoretical support for the idea that both mechanisms shape red grouse cycles.

TI Determining Causality and Controlling Disease is Based on Collaborative
   Research involving Multidisciplinary Approaches
AB Understanding the causes of infectious disease to facilitate better control requires observational and experimental studies. Often these must be conducted at many scales such as at the molecular, cellular, organism, and population level. Studies need to consider both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the pathogen/host interaction. They also require a combination of study methods covered by disciplines such as pathology, epidemiology, microbiology, and ecology. Therefore, it is important that disciplines work together when designing and conducting studies. Finally, we need to integrate and interpret data across levels and disciplines to better formulate control strategies. This requires another group of specialists with broad cross-disciplinary training in epidemiology and an ability to readily work with others.

TI Ectoparasite Infestations of Hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are
   Associated with Small-Scale Landscape Structures in an Urban-Suburban
   Environment
AB Animals that exploit heterogeneous and patchy environments encounter different local habitat conditions that influence their interaction with the environment, such as the acquisition of parasites. How and at which scales interaction processes between parasites, hosts, and the environment are realized remains largely unknown. We examined the infestation patterns of 56 hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) with fleas and ticks at a small spatial scale within a 12 km(2) area along a suburban-urban gradient in southwestern Germany. The structure and type of habitats surrounding hedgehog capture locations were estimated from digital land cover data within radii of 20, 50, and 100 m. These were assumed to match the ranging area and underlying heterogeneous landscape matrix in which host-parasite interactions take place. Landscape-based models suggested that flea burdens significantly decreased with the diversity and heterogeneity of land cover, as well as with the areal coverage of roads within radii of 50 and 100 m. Overall tick infestation levels were mostly explained by the number of arable patches and the areal coverage of roads within radii of 50 and 100 m, as well as date of capture. Examination of the semivariance in model residuals revealed no evident spatial structure in any of the models with flea or tick infestation patterns as response variables. Our results, which are based on a sampling scheme within a relatively small spatio-temporal window, suggest that heterogeneous landscape matrices affect parasitization rates of animals in urban environments, with clear differences at the individual level.

TI Mortality Rates Differ Among Amphibian Populations Exposed to Three
   Strains of a Lethal Ranavirus
AB Infectious diseases are a growing threat to biodiversity, in many cases because of synergistic effects with habitat loss, environmental contamination, and climate change. Emergence of pathogens as new threats to host populations can also arise when novel combinations of hosts and pathogens are unintentionally brought together, for example, via commercial trade or wildlife relocations and reintroductions. Chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) and amphibian ranaviruses (family Iridoviridae) are pathogens implicated in global amphibian declines. The emergence of disease associated with these pathogens appears to be at least partly related to recent translocations over large geographic distances. We experimentally examined the outcomes of novel combinations of host populations and pathogen strains using the amphibian ranavirus Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV) and barred tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium, formerly considered part of the Ambystoma tigrinum complex). One salamander population was highly resistant to lethal infections by all ATV strains, including its own strain, and mortality rates differed among ATV strains according to salamander population. Mortality rates in novel pairings of salamander population and ATV strain were not predictable based on knowledge of mortality rates when salamander populations were exposed to their own ATV strain. The underlying cause(s) for the differences in mortality rates are unknown, but local selection pressures on salamanders, viruses, or both, across the range of this widespread host-pathogen system are a plausible hypothesis. Our study highlights the need to minimize translocations of amphibian ranaviruses, even among conspecifc host populations, and the importance of considering intraspecific variation in endeavors to manage wildlife diseases.

TI Random, top-down, or bottom-up coexistence of parasites: malaria
   population dynamics in multi-parasitic settings
AB Epidemiological models concerned with the control of malaria using interventions such as bed nets and vaccines increasingly incorporate realistic aspects of malaria biology. The increasing complexity of these models limits their ability to abstract ecological processes and to address questions on the regulation of population dynamics using time-series data, particularly in regards to interactions between different pathogens and the regulatory role of innate (bottom-up) and acquired (top-down) immunity. We use a theoretical framework to test hypotheses on the importance of population-level immunity and parasite abundance in regulating the population dynamics of malaria. We use qualitative loop analyses to examine the sign of the interaction between Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax at the population level, and we discuss implications of this sign for the within-host regulation of parasites. Our analyses of monthly malaria time-series data from the island of Espirito Santo, Vanuatu (1983-1997), show that the dynamics of P. falciparum are not sensitive to P. vivax, whereas infections by the latter increase in response to those of the former. These results support a differential use of resources inside the hosts, a resource-consumer interaction between hosts and their immune system, and within-host regulation of parasites. Finally, our results emphasize the need to better understand factors regulating malaria dynamics before developing control strategies and call for the use of control strategies directed at the interruption of transmission, such as vector control and the use of bed nets.

TI Mapping the basic reproduction number (R-0) for vector-borne diseases: A
   case study on bluetongue virus
AB Geographical maps indicating the value of the basic reproduction number, R-0, can be used to identify areas of higher risk for an outbreak after an introduction. We develop a methodology to create R-0 maps for vector-borne diseases, using bluetongue virus as a case study. This method provides a tool for gauging the extent of environmental effects on disease emergence. The method involves integrating vector-abundance data with statistical approaches to predict abundance from satellite imagery and with the biologically mechanistic modelling that underlies R-0. We illustrate the method with three applications for bluetongue virus in the Netherlands: 1) a simple R-0 map for the situation in September 2006, 2) species-specific R-0 maps based on satellite-data derived predictions, and 3) monthly R0 maps throughout the year. These applications ought to be considered as a proof-of-principle and illustrations of the methods described, rather than as ready-to-use risk maps. Altogether, this is a first step towards an integrative method to predict risk of establishment of diseases based on mathematical modelling combined with a geographic information system that may comprise climatic variables, landscape features, land use, and other relevant factors determining the risk of establishment for bluetongue as well as of other emerging vector-borne diseases.

TI The vicious circle and infection intensity: The case of Trypanosoma
   microti in field vole populations
AB Objective: In natural populations, infection and condition may act synergistically to trigger a vicious circle: poor condition predisposes to host infections, which further reduce condition, and so on. If this vicious circle originates from a reduced resistance to infection, it will not only result in greater proneness to becoming infected of those that are in poorer condition, but it may also cause infections of higher intensity. Here, we investigate the temporal relationship between host condition and intensity of infection by a specific pathogen using as a system the dynamics of the protozoan Trypanosoma microti in field vole (Microtus agrestis) populations.
   Methods and results: With two years of longitudinal data from three monthly-sampled populations, we evaluated if individuals acquiring a high intensity of infection previously had lower haematological indicators of condition (red blood cells [RBCs] and lymphocyte counts) than those that acquired lower infection intensities. Also, the association of these indicators with past and present trypanosome blood levels was investigated. The individuals that developed high levels of parasitaemia were those that previously had low lymphocyte counts. Greater intensity of infection corresponded with lower RBCs only in low to moderate weight females, and no effect of intensity of infection on lymphocyte counts was observed. However, delayed effects of high trypanosome intensity were seen on both RBCs and lymphocytes.
   Conclusions: The vicious circle may also result in high infection intensity: individuals in poor condition are not only more likely to become infected by one pathogen; they may also be the most important source of infection for that and for other pathogens, and thus key protagonists for parasite dynamics.

TI Host condition and individual risk of cowpox virus infection in natural
   animal populations: cause or effect?
AB Recent studies have provided evidence that endemic pathogens may affect dynamics in animals. However, such studies have not typically considered that infected individuals might have a preceding underlying poor condition. We examined whether individuals in poor condition are more likely to become infected by an endemic pathogen, using as a system the dynamics of cowpox virus in field voles. With data from monthly sampled vole populations, a nested case-control study evaluated whether Susceptible individuals with poorer condition had higher probabilities of contracting cowpox. The influence of condition was found to be considerable, especially for males. At times when a susceptible male with good body condition had a relatively low probability of becoming infected., a susceptible male with poor body condition was twice as likely to contract cowpox; if this male was also anaemic, the chances were almost quadrupled. We discuss the care needed when interpreting the findings of wildlife disease studies.

TI EVIDENCE FOR NEGATIVE FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION DURING EXPERIMENTAL
   COEVOLUTION OF A FRESHWATER SNAIL AND A STERILIZING TREMATODE
AB Host-parasite coevolution is often suggested as a mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity, but finding direct evidence has proven difficult. In the present study, we examine the process of coevolution using a freshwater New Zealand snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) and its common parasite (the sterilizing trematode, Microphallus sp.) Specifically, we test for changes in genotypic composition of clonal host populations in experimental populations evolving either with or without parasites for six generations. As predicted under the Red Queen model of coevolution, the initially most common host genotype decreased in frequency in the presence, but not the absence, of parasitism. Furthermore, the initially most common host genotype became more susceptible to infection by the coevolving parasite populations over the course of the experiment. These results are consistent with parasite-meditated selection leading to a rare advantage, and they indicate rapid coevolution at the genotypic level between a host and its parasite.

TI ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION OF A TRANSMISSIBLE CANCER
AB Canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is an infectious disease of dogs. Remarkably, the infectious agent is the cancerous cell itself. To investigate its origin and spread, we collected 37 tumor samples from four continents and determined their evolutionary relationships using microsatellite length differences and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). The different tumors show very little microsatellite variation, and the pattern of variation that does exist is consistent with a purely asexual mode of transmission. Approximately one quarter of the loci scored by aCGH show copy number variation relative to normal dogs, again with little variation among different tumor samples. Sequence analysis of the RPPH1 gene indicates an origin from either dogs or wolves, and microsatellite analysis indicates that the tumor is more than 6000 years old, and perhaps originated when dogs were first domesticated. By contrast, the common ancestor of extant tumors lived within the last few hundred years, long after the first tumor. The genetic and genomic patterns we observe are typical of those expected of asexual pathogens, and the extended time since first origin may explain the many remarkable adaptations that have enabled this mammalian cell lineage to live as a unicellular pathogen.

TI Host immunization shapes interspecific associations in trematode
   parasites
AB P>1. Individuals of free-living organisms are commonly infected by multiple parasite species. Under such circumstances, positive or negative associations between the species are possible because of direct or indirect interactions, details in parasite transmission ecology and host-mediated factors. One possible mechanism underlying these processes is host immunity, but its role in shaping these associations has rarely been tackled experimentally.
   2. In this study, we tested the effect of host immunization on associations between trematode parasites infecting eyes of fish. We first analysed the associations between three species (Diplostomum spathaceum, Diplostomum gasterostei and Tylodelphys clavata) in wild hosts, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis). Second, using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a model fish species, we experimentally investigated how sequential immunization of the host (i.e. one parasite species infects and immunizes the host first) could affect the associations between two of the species.
   3. The results indicated that most of the associations were positive in wild hosts, which supports between-individual variation in host susceptibility, rather than competitive exclusion between the parasite species. However, positive associations were more common in roach than in perch, possibly reflecting differences in ecological conditions of exposure between the host species. The experimental data showed that positive associations between two of the species were eroded by host immunization against one of the parasite species.
   4. We conclude that sequential immunization of hosts has a marked effect on interspecific parasite associations and basically can determine if positive associations are detected or not. This implies that correlative results suggesting non-interactive community structure in general may be obscured by the sequence of previous parasite exposure and corresponding dynamics of host immunization.
