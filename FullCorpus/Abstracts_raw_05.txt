TI A Case Series of 104 Women Infected with HIV-1 via Blood Transfusion
   Postnatally: High Rate of HIV-1 Transmission to Infants through
   Breast-Feeding
AB We investigated transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) via breast-feeding by 104 Chinese mothers who acquired the infection through blood transfusion postnatally. Of 106 children, 38 (35.8%) were infected. All children survived to age 5 years, and their survival curve was similar to that of their mothers. These findings suggest a high rate of HIV-1 transmission via breast-feeding when mothers were infected postnatally via blood transfusion, perhaps because of the higher viremia expected during the acute phase of infection. The course of disease among infected children was significantly less rapid than that among new-borns infected perinatally, suggesting that a brief window of HIV-1-free life often enables the immune system of an infant to stave off rapid disease progression.

TI Key gaps in the knowledge of Plasmodium vivax, a neglected human malaria
   parasite
AB Plasmodium vivax is geographically the most widely distributed cause of malaria in people, with up to 2.5 billion people at risk and an estimated 80 million to 300 million clinical cases every year-including severe disease and death. Despite this large burden of disease, P vivax is overlooked and left in the shadow of the enormous problem caused by Plasmodium falciparum in sub-Saharan Africa. The technological advances enabling the sequencing of the P vivax genome and a recent call for worldwide malaria eradication have together placed new emphasis on the importance of addressing P vivax as a major public health problem. However, because of this parasite's biology, it is especially difficult to interrupt the transmission of P vivax, and experts agree that the available methods for preventing and treating infections with P vivax are inadequate. It is thus imperative that the development of new methods and strategies become a priority. Advancing the development of such methods needs renewed emphasis on understanding the biology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of P vivax. This Review critically examines what is known about P vivax, focusing on identifying the crucial gaps that create obstacles to the elimination of this parasite in human populations.

TI Host-parasite determinants of parasite population structure: lessons
   from bats and mites on the importance of time
AB By definition, parasitic organisms are strongly dependant on their hosts, and for a great majority, this dependence includes host-to-host transmission. Constraints imposed by the host's spatial distribution and demography, in combination with those of the parasite, can lead to a metapopulation structure, where parasite populations are highly stochastic (i.e. prone to frequent extinctions and re-colonizations) and where drift becomes a major force shaping standing genetic variation. This, in turn, will directly affect the observed population structure, along with the ability of the parasite to adapt (or co-adapt) to its host. However, only a specific consideration of temporal dynamics can reveal the extent to which drift shapes parasite population structure; this is rarely taken into account in population genetic studies of parasitic organisms. The study by Bruyndonckx et al. in this issue of Molecular Ecology does just this and, in doing so, illustrates how a comparison of host-parasite co-structures in light of temporal dynamics can be particularly informative for understanding the ecological and evolutionary constraints imposed by the host. More specifically, the authors examine spatial and temporal population genetic data of a parasitic mite Spinturnix bechsteini that exclusively exploits the Bechstein's bat Myotis bechsteinii and consider these data in relation to host-parasite life histories and the population structure of the host.

TI Spatio-temporal population genetic structure of the parasitic mite
   Spinturnix bechsteini is shaped by its own demography and the social
   system of its bat host
AB Information about the population genetic structures of parasites is important for an understanding of parasite transmission pathways and ultimately the co-evolution with their hosts. If parasites cannot disperse independently of their hosts, a parasite's population structure will depend upon the host's spatial distribution. Geographical barriers affecting host dispersal can therefore lead to structured parasite populations. However, how the host's social system affects the genetic structure of parasite populations is largely unknown. We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to describe the spatio-temporal population structure of a contact-transmitted parasitic wing mite (Spinturnix bechsteini) and compared it to that of its social host, the Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii). We observed no genetic differentiation between mites living on different bats within a colony. This suggests that mites can move freely among bats of the same colony. As expected in case of restricted inter-colony dispersal, we observed a strong genetic differentiation of mites among demographically isolated bat colonies. In contrast, we found a strong genetic turnover between years when we investigated the temporal variation of mite haplotypes within colonies. This can be explained with mite dispersal occuring between colonies and bottlenecks of mite populations within colonies. The observed absence of isolation by distance could be the result from genetic drift and/or from mites dispersing even between remote bat colonies, whose members may meet at mating sites in autumn or in hibernacula in winter. Our data show that the population structure of this parasitic wing mite is influenced by its own demography and the peculiar social system of its bat host.

TI Murine Models for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense Disease Progression-From
   Silent to Chronic Infections and Early Brain Tropism
AB Background: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense remains highly prevalent in west and central Africa and is lethal if left untreated. The major problem is that the disease often evolves toward chronic or asymptomatic forms with low and fluctuating parasitaemia producing apparently aparasitaemic serological suspects who remain untreated because of the toxicity of the chemotherapy. Whether the different types of infections are due to host or parasite factors has been difficult to address, since T.b. gambiense isolated from patients is often not infectious in rodents thus limiting the variety of isolates.
   Methodology/Principal findings: T.b. gambiense parasites were outgrown directly from the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients by in vitro culture and analyzed for their molecular polymorphisms. Experimental murine infections showed that these isolates could be clustered into three groups with different characteristics regarding their in vivo infection properties, immune response and capacity for brain invasion. The first isolate induced a classical chronic infection with a fluctuating blood parasitaemia, an invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), a trypanosome specific-antibody response and death of the animals within 6 -8 months. The second group induced a sub-chronic infection resulting in a single wave of parasitaemia after infection, followed by a low parasitaemia with no parasites detected by microscope observations of blood but detected by PCR, and the presence of a specific antibody response. The third isolate induced a silent infection characterised by the absence of microscopically detectable parasites throughout, but infection was detectable by PCR during the whole course of infection. Additionally, specific antibodies were barely detectable when mice were infected with a low number of this group of parasites. In both sub-chronic and chronic infections, most of the mice survived more than one year without major clinical symptoms despite an early dissemination and growth of the parasites in different organs including the CNS, as demonstrated by bioluminescent imaging.
   Conclusions/Significance: Whereas trypanosome characterisation assigned all these isolates to the homogeneous Group I of T.b. gambiense, they clearly induce very different infections in mice thus mimicking the broad clinical diversity observed in HAT due to T.b. gambiense. Therefore, these murine models will be very useful for the understanding of different aspects of the physiopathology of HAT and for the development of new diagnostic tools and drugs.

TI The Consequences of Spatial Structure for the Evolution of Pathogen
   Transmission Rate and Virulence
AB The distribution of organisms in space can be an important mediator of species interactions, but its evolutionary effects on those interactions are only beginning to be explored. These effects may be especially relevant to pathogen-host interactions. A detailed understanding of how and when spatial structure will affect the evolution of pathogen traits is likely to aid our ability to control rapidly emerging infectious diseases. Here we review a growing body of theoretical studies suggesting that spatial structure can lead to the evolution of an intermediate pathogen transmission rate and virulence. We explain the results of these studies in terms of a competition-persistence trade-off. These studies strongly suggest that local host interactions, local host dispersal, and relatively low host reproduction rates create a host population spatial structure that enforces this trade-off and leads to the evolution of lower pathogen transmission rates and virulence. They also suggest that when spatial structure exists, it can dominate over the shape of the transmission-virulence trade-off in determining pathogen traits. We also identify important areas of future research, including quantifying pathogen fitness in a spatial context in order to gain a more mechanistic understanding of the effects of spatial structure and observationally and experimentally testing theoretical predictions.

TI The Impact of Transgenic Mosquitoes on Dengue Virulence to Humans and
   Mosquitoes
AB Dengue is a major public health concern in the tropics and subtropics. Innovative transgenic strategies to render Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of dengue, incompetent for dengue transmission are under development. We modeled the evolutionary impact of different transgenic mosquito strategies on dengue-induced mortality, that is, dengue virulence, to both humans and mosquitoes. This model incorporates various evolutionary trade-offs in dengue virus epidemiological traits, for example, a trade-off between dengue transmission rate and its virulence to humans. Our results indicate that strategies that block transmission or reduce mosquito biting impose selection on dengue virulence in humans. This selection can be for either higher or lower virulence, depending on the interaction between the effect of the transgene and the trade-offs in epidemiological traits, highlighting the need for detailed quantitative data to understand more fully the impact of mosquito transgenesis on dengue virulence. Dengue virulence in mosquitoes can be selected on by transgenic strategies of blocking transmission, decreased mosquito biting, increased mosquito background mortality, and increased mosquito infection-induced mortality. Our results suggest that dengue control strategies that raise mosquito background mortality or mosquito infection-induced mortality pose less risk of causing increased virulence to humans than strategies that block transmission or reduce mosquito biting.

TI Impact and Dynamics of Disease in Species Threatened by the Amphibian
   Chytrid Fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
AB Estimating disease-associated mortality and transmission processes is difficult in free-ranging wildlife but important for understanding disease impacts and dynamics and for informing management decisions. In a capture-mark-recapture study, we used a PCR-based diagnostic test in combination with multistate models to provide the first estimates of disease-associated mortality and detection, infection, and recovery rates for frogs endemically infected with the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the pandemic amphibian disease chytridiomycosis. We found that endemic chytridiomycosis was associated with a substantial reduction (approximately 38%) in apparent monthly survival of the threatened rainforest treefrog Litoria pearsoniana despite a long period of coexistence (approximately 30 years); detection rate was not influenced by disease status; improved recovery and reduced infection rates correlated with decreased prevalence, which occurred when temperatures increased; and incorporating changes in individuals' infection status through time with multistate models increased effect size and support (98.6% vs. 71% of total support) for the presence of disease-associated mortality when compared with a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in which infection status was restricted to the time of first capture. Our results indicate that amphibian populations can face significant ongoing pressure from chytridiomycosis long after epidemics associated with initial Bd invasions subside, an important consideration for the long-term conservation of many amphibian species worldwide. Our findings also improve confidence in estimates of disease prevalence in wild amphibians and provide a general framework for estimating parameters in epidemiological models for chytridiomycosis, an important step toward better understanding and management of this disease.

TI Predator-spreaders: Predation can enhance parasite success in a
   planktonic host-parasite system
AB The "healthy herds" hypothesis suggests that selective predators, by acting as parasite sinks, may inhibit the start of epidemics and reduce prevalence of infection. Here, we describe a counter-example using field patterns, experiments, and a model. The predator Chaoborus releases infective spores of a fungal parasite and, in doing so, may facilitate epidemics in Daphnia populations. In the field, epidemics occur in lakes with higher Chaoborus densities. Experiments revealed that nonselective Chaoborus release many of the spores contained in their prey. Since these released spores remain infective, this predator can catalyze epidemics when a lake's physical environment might otherwise impede them. Without Chaoborus, Daphnia dying of infection may sink to the lake bottom before releasing spores. A model tracking hosts and spores in the water column (where hosts contact spores) and in bottom sediments (where they cannot) illustrates this mechanism. Thus, by dispersing spores while feeding, this predator spreads disease. Many invertebrates are parasitized by obligately killing parasites, offering a variety of systems for additional tests of this "predator-spreader" hypothesis. In the meantime, this planktonic disease system prompts a very important, general warning: before we use predators to keep the herds healthy, we need to carefully think about the interface between predator feeding biology and the underlying epidemiology of wildlife disease.

TI School closure may be effective in reducing transmission of respiratory
   viruses in the community
AB Proposed measures to contain pandemic influenza include school closure, although the effectiveness of this has not been investigated. We examined the effect of a nationwide elementary school strike in Israel in 2000 on the incidence of influenza-like illness. In this historical observational study of 1.7 million members of a preferred provider organization, we analysed diagnoses from primary-care visits during the winter months in 1998-2002. We calculated the weekly ratio of influenza-like diagnoses to non-respiratory diagnoses, and fitted regression models for school-aged children, children's household members, and all other individuals aged >12 years. For each population the steepest drop in the ratio of influenza-like diagnoses to non-respiratory diagnoses occurred in the strike year 2 weeks after the start of the strike. The changes in the weekly ratio of influenza-like diagnoses to non-respiratory diagnoses were statistically significant (P = 0.0074) for school children for the strike year compared to other years. A smaller decrease was also seen for the adults with no school-aged children in 1999 (P = 0.037). The Chanukah holiday had a negative impact on the ratio for school-aged children in 1998, 1999 and 2001 (P = 0.008, 0.006 and 0.045, respectively) and was statistically significant for both adult groups in 1999 and for adults with no school-aged children in 2001. School closure should be considered part of the containment strategy in an influenza pandemic.

TI Climate variability and Ross River virus infections in Riverland, South
   Australia, 1992-2004
AB Ross River virus (RRV) infection is the most common notifiable vector-borne disease in Australia, with around 6000 cases annually. This study aimed to examine the relationship between climate variability and notified RRV infections in the Riverland region of South Australia in order to set up an early warning system for the disease in temperate-climate regions. Notified data of RRV infections were collected by the South Australian Department of Health. Climatic variables and monthly river flow were provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and South Australian Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation over the period 1992-2004. Spearman correlation and time-series-adjusted Poisson regression analysis were performed. The results indicate that increases in monthly mean minimum and maximum temperatures, monthly total rainfall, monthly mean Southern Oscillation Index and monthly flow in the Murray River increase the likelihood, but an increase in monthly mean relative humidity decreases the likelihood, of disease transmission in the region, with different time-lag effects. This study demonstrates that a useful early warning system can be developed for local regions based on the statistical analysis of readily available climate data. These early warning systems can be utilized by local public health authorities to develop disease prevention and control activities.

TI THE EFFECT OF SIBMATING ON THE INFECTION DYNAMICS OF MALE-KILLING
   BACTERIA
AB Male-killing (MK) bacteria are vertically transmitted endosymbionts that selectively kill the male offspring of their hosts. Simple mathematical models describe the infection dynamics using two parameters, the bacterial transmission rate and a fitness compensation for siblings of killed males. These models cannot explain two phenomena that have been observed in nature: the persistence of extreme MK causing all-female broods, and the coexistence of two different strains of MK bacteria in the same host population. In the present study, we extend the simple MK models and investigate theoretically the effects of sibmating on the infection dynamics. We demonstrate analytically that, in general, sibmating reduces MK prevalence, and can even cause its extinction. As a special case of this finding, we show that sibmating allows a stable coexistence between no infection and extreme MK. Furthermore, we performed computer simulations and showed that, depending on male mating capacity, a stable coexistence of two strains is possible if sibmating occurs but is below a threshold. The results suggest that sibmating might be an important factor for understanding the infection dynamics of MK bacteria.

TI A genetic background with low mutational robustness is associated with
   increased adaptability to a novel host in an RNA virus
AB Although mutational robustness is central to many evolutionary processes, its relationship to evolvability remains poorly understood and has been very rarely tested experimentally. Here, we measure the evolvability of Vesicular stomatitis virus in two genetic backgrounds with different levels of mutational robustness. We passaged the viruses into a novel cell type to model a host-jump episode, quantified changes in infectivity and fitness in the new host, evaluated the cost of adaptation in the original host and analyzed the genetic basis of this adaptation. Lineages evolved from the less robust genetic background demonstrated increased adaptability, paid similar costs of adaptation to the new host and fixed approximately the same number of mutations as their more robust counterparts. Theory predicts that robustness can promote evolvability only in systems where large sets of genotypes are connected by effectively neutral mutations. We argue that this condition might not be fulfilled generally in RNA viruses.

TI Evolution of host resistance and trade-offs between virulence and
   transmission potential in an obligately killing parasite
AB Standard epidemiological theory predicts that parasites, which continuously release propagules during infection, face a trade-off between virulence and transmission. However, little is known how host resistance and parasite virulence change during coevolution with obligate killers. To address this question we have set up a coevolution experiment evolving Nosema whitei on eight distinct lines of Tribolium castaneum. After 11 generations we conducted a time-shift experiment infecting both the coevolved and the replicate control host lines with the original parasite source, and coevolved parasites from generation 8 and 11. We found higher survival in the coevolved host lines than in the matching control lines. In the parasite populations, virulence measured as host mortality decreased during coevolution, while sporeload stayed constant. Both patterns are compatible with adaptive evolution by selection for resistance in the host and by trade-offs between virulence and transmission potential in the parasite.

TI The maintenance of sex: host-parasite coevolution with density-dependent
   virulence
AB Why don't asexual females replace sexual females in most natural populations of eukaryotes? One promising explanation is that parasites could counter the reproductive advantages of asexual reproduction by exerting frequency-dependent selection against common clones (the Red Queen hypothesis). One apparent limitation of the Red Queen theory, however, is that parasites would seem to be required by theory to be highly virulent. In the present study, I present a population-dynamic view of competition between sexual females and asexual females that interact with co-evolving parasites. The results show that asexual populations have higher carrying capacities, and more unstable population dynamics, than sexual populations. The results also suggest that the spread of a clone into a sexual population could increase the effective parasite virulence as population density increases. This combination of parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection, and density-dependent virulence, could lead to the coexistence of sexual and asexual reproductive strategies and the long-term persistence of sex.

TI Manifold aspects of specificity in a nematode-bacterium mutualism
AB Coevolution in mutualistic symbiosis can yield, because the interacting partners share common interests, to coadaptation: hosts perform better when associated with symbionts of their own locality than with others coming from more distant places. However, as the two partners of a symbiosis might also experience conflicts over part of their life cycle, coadaptation might not occur for all life-history traits. We investigated this issue in symbiotic systems where nematodes (Steinernema) and bacteria (Xenorhabdus) reproduce in insects they have both contributed to kill. Newborn infective juveniles (IJs) that carry bacteria in their intestine then disperse from the insect cadaver in search of a new host to infect. We ran experiments where nematodes coinfect insects with bacteria that differ from their native symbiont. In both Steinernema carpocapsae/Xenorhabdus nematophila and Steinernema feltiae/Xenorhabdus bovienii symbioses, we detected an overall specificity which favours the hypothesis of a fine-tuned co-adaptation process. However, we also found that the life-history traits involved in specificity strongly differ between the two model systems: when associated with strains that differ too much from their native symbionts, S. carpocapsae has low parasitic success, whereas S. feltiae has low survival in dispersal stage.

Few studies have examined interactions between these two factors, particularly at the level of individual genes. We examined how the presence of a bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, affected the selection against each of eight deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that mutations tended to become more deleterious in the presence of disease. This increase in the average selection was primarily due to three genes with the remainder showing little evidence of change.

TI Perinatal Outcomes, Including Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, and
   Child Mortality and Their Association with Maternal Vitamin D Status in
   Tanzania
AB Background. Vitamin D is a strong immunomodulator and may protect against adverse pregnancy outcomes, mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and child mortality.
   Methods. A total of 884 HIV-infected pregnant women who were participating in a vitamin supplementation trial in Tanzania were monitored to assess pregnancy outcomes and child mortality. The association of these outcomes with maternal vitamin D status at enrollment was examined in an observational analysis.
   Results. No association was observed between maternal vitamin D status and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight and preterm birth. In multivariate models, a low maternal vitamin D level (< 32 ng/ mL) was associated with a 50% higher risk (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-120%) of MTCT of HIV at 6 weeks, a 2-fold higher risk of MTCT of HIV through breast-feeding among children who were HIV uninfected at 6 weeks (95% CI, 1.08-3.82), and a 46% higher overall risk of HIV infection (95% CI, 11%-91%). Children born to women with a low vitamin D level had a 61% higher risk of dying during follow-up (95% CI, 25%-107%).
   Conclusions. If found to be efficacious in randomized trials, vitamin D supplementation could prove to be an inexpensive method of reducing the burden of HIV infection and death among children, particularly in resource-limited settings.

TI Prevalence and diversity patterns of avian blood parasites in degraded
   African rainforest habitats
AB Land use changes including deforestation, road construction and agricultural encroachments have been linked to the increased prevalence of several infectious diseases. In order to better understand how deforestation affects the prevalence of vector-borne infectious diseases in wildlife, nine paired sites were sampled (disturbed vs. undisturbed habitats) in Southern Cameroon. We studied the diversity, prevalence and distribution of avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and other related haemosporidians (species of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) from these sites in two widespread species of African rainforest birds, the yellow-whiskered greenbul (Andropadus latirostris, Pycnonotidae) and the olive sunbird (Cyanomitra olivacea, Nectariniidae). Twenty-six mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages were identified: 20 Plasmodium lineages and 6 Haemoproteus lineages. These lineages showed no geographic specificity, nor significant differences in lineage diversity between habitat types. However, we found that the prevalence of Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus infections were significantly higher in undisturbed than in deforested habitats (Leucocytozoon spp. 50.3% vs. 35.8%, Haemoproteus spp. 16.3% vs. 10.8%). We also found higher prevalence for all haemosporidian parasites in C. olivacea than in A. latirostris species (70.2% vs. 58.2%). Interestingly, we found one morphospecies of Plasmodium in C. olivacea, as represented by a clade of related lineages, showed increased prevalence at disturbed sites, while another showed a decrease, testifying to different patterns of transmission, even among closely related lineages of avian malaria, in relation to deforestation. Our work demonstrates that anthropogenic habitat change can affect host-parasite systems and result in opposing trends in prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in wild bird populations.

TI Antigenic Diversity, Transmission Mechanisms, and the Evolution of
   Pathogens
AB Pathogens have evolved diverse strategies to maximize their transmission fitness. Here we investigate these strategies for directly transmitted pathogens using mathematical models of disease pathogenesis and transmission, modeling fitness as a function of within-and between-host pathogen dynamics. The within-host model includes realistic constraints on pathogen replication via resource depletion and cross-immunity between pathogen strains. We find three distinct types of infection emerge as maxima in the fitness landscape, each characterized by particular within-host dynamics, host population contact network structure, and transmission mode. These three infection types are associated with distinct non-overlapping ranges of levels of antigenic diversity, and well-defined patterns of within-host dynamics and between-host transmissibility. Fitness, quantified by the basic reproduction number, also falls within distinct ranges for each infection type. Every type is optimal for certain contact structures over a range of contact rates. Sexually transmitted infections and childhood diseases are identified as exemplar types for low and high contact rates, respectively. This work generates a plausible mechanistic hypothesis for the observed tradeoff between pathogen transmissibility and antigenic diversity, and shows how different classes of pathogens arise evolutionarily as fitness optima for different contact network structures and host contact rates.

TI Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission Model for Probing Allosteric
   Dynamics of Large Macromolecular Assembling: A Study of GroEL-GroES
AB Large macromolecular assemblies are often important for biological processes in cells. Allosteric communications between different parts of these molecular machines play critical roles in cellular signaling. Although studies of the topology and fluctuation dynamics of coarse-grained residue networks can yield important insights, they do not provide characterization of the time-dependent dynamic behavior of these macromolecular assemblies. Here we develop a novel approach called Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model to study globally the dynamic responses of the macromolecular assemblies. By monitoring simultaneous responses of all residues (>8,000) across many (>6) decades of time spanning from the initial perturbation until reaching equilibrium using a Krylov subspace projection method, we show that this approach can yield rich information. With criteria based on quantitative measurements of relaxation half-time, flow amplitude change, and oscillation dynamics, this approach can identify pivot residues that are important for macromolecular movement, messenger residues that are key to signal mediating, and anchor residues important for binding interactions. Based on a detailed analysis of the GroEL-GroES chaperone system, we found that our predictions have an accuracy of 71-84% judged by independent experimental studies reported in the literature. This approach is general and can be applied to other large macromolecular machineries such as the virus capsid and ribosomal complex.

TI Mosquito Infection Responses to Developing Filarial Worms
AB Human lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-vectored disease caused by the nematode parasites Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. These are relatively large roundworms that can cause considerable damage in compatible mosquito vectors. In order to assess how mosquitoes respond to infection in compatible mosquito-filarial worm associations, microarray analysis was used to evaluate transcriptome changes in Aedes aegypti at various times during B. malayi development. Changes in transcript abundance in response to the different stages of B. malayi infection were diverse. At the early stages of midgut and thoracic muscle cell penetration, a greater number of genes were repressed compared to those that were induced (20 vs. 8). The non-feeding, intracellular first-stage larvae elicited few differences, with 4 transcripts showing an increased and 9 a decreased abundance relative to controls. Several cecropin transcripts increased in abundance after parasites molted to second-stage larvae. However, the greatest number of transcripts changed in abundance after larvae molted to third-stage larvae and migrated to the head and proboscis (120 induced, 38 repressed), including a large number of putative, immunity-related genes (similar to 13% of genes with predicted functions). To test whether the innate immune system of mosquitoes was capable of modulating permissiveness to the parasite, we activated the Toll and Imd pathway controlled rel family transcription factors Rel1 and Rel2 (by RNA interference knockdown of the pathway's negative regulators Cactus and Caspar) during the early stages of infection with B. malayi. The activation of either of these immune signaling pathways, or knockdown of the Toll pathway, did not affect B. malayi in Ae. aegypti. The possibility of LF parasites evading mosquito immune responses during successful development is discussed.

AB A survey of ectoparasites and their associated pathogens was conducted in two South Carolina zoos, from 2004 to 2007. Dead, wild birds and mammals, as well as captive animals examined during routine veterinary checks constituted the study populations. Ectoparasites were tested for species of Anaplasma, Bartonella, Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, and Trypanosoma. Forty-six species of ectoparasites were collected from 133 free-roaming and captive hosts and their associated nesting and bedding materials. Six vector-borne pathogens were detected molecularly in the ectoparasites, including Anaplasma phagocytophilum in the tick Ixodes dentatus Marx from an eastern cottontail rabbit, Bartonella clarridgeiae in the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche) from a Virginia opossum, Bartonella sp. Oh6 in the squirrel flea Orchopeas howardi (Baker) from an eastern grey squirrel, Bartonella sp. T7498 in the sucking louse Neohaematopinus sciuri Jancke from a squirrel, Rickettsia sp. Rf2125 in C. felis from a zookeeper and a grizzly bear, and Rickettsiales sp. Ib 2006 in Ixodes brunneus Koch from an American crow. While the pathology of some of these pathogens is poorly known, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis) and Bartonella clarridgeiae (causative agent of a disease similar to cat-scratch disease) can infect humans. Ectoparasites and their pathogens, especially those originating from free-roaming animals, present a potential threat to captive animals and humans.

TI Geographic Variation in Risk Factors for SFG Rickettsial and Leptospiral
   Exposure in Colombia
AB In order to characterize the patterns of human exposure to spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsial and leptospiral infection, IgG surveys were conducted on 642 residents of ten different areas of the rural district of Necocli, Colombia. Areas were selected based on forest cover and human settlement pattern, and individual risk factors were elucidated through multivariate logistic models, controlling for variance clustering within communities. Overall, prevalence of high antibody titers indicating previous exposure to SFG rickettsia and leptospira was 29.2% and 35.6%, respectively, and both were most prevalent in the same peri-urban neighborhood. Forest cover >10% demonstrated the strongest independent association with leptospiral exposure, followed by homes with outdoor storage sheds. Isolated rural housing was the only variable independently associated with SFG rickettsia exposure. Community-level variables significantly modified the effects of individual risk factors. For both pathogens the eldest quartile was less exposed in periurban areas although there was no age effect overall for either. Females living in population settlements were more exposed to SFG rickettsiae but there was no sex association in isolated rural houses. Similarly, in sites with forest cover >10%, individuals working at home had higher leptospira seroprevalence, but place of work was not a risk factor in areas of forest cover >10%. These data suggest that the patterns of maintenance and/or exposure to leptospira and rickettsia vary across different human created landscapes and settlement patterns. While contrasting risk factors may reflect the unique transmission cycles of each pathogen, the observed patterns of geographic variation suggest that both diseases may respond similarly larger scale human-ecological dynamics.

AB Sylvatic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is a flea-borne disease that primarily affects rodents but has been detected in over 200 mammal species worldwide. Mammalian carnivores are routinely surveyed as sentinels of local plague activity, since they can present antibodies to Y. pestis infection but show few clinical signs. In Boulder County, Colorado, USA, plague epizootic events are episodic and occur in black-tailed prairie dogs. Enzootic hosts are unidentified as are plague foci. For three years, we systematically sampled carnivores in two distinct habitat types to determine whether carnivores may play a role in maintenance or transmission of Y. pestis and to identify habitats associated with increased plague prevalence. We sampled 83 individuals representing six carnivore species and found only two that had been exposed to Y. pestis. The low overall rate of plague exposure in carnivores suggests that plague may be ephemeral in this study system, and thus we cannot draw any conclusions regarding habitat-associated plague foci or temporal changes in plague activity. Plague epizootics involving prairie dogs were confirmed in this study system during two of the three years of this study, and we therefore suggest that the targeting carnivores to survey for plague may not be appropriate in all ecological systems.

TI Trypanosoma cruzi Induces Life-History Trait Changes in the Wild Kissing
   Bug Mepraia spinolai: Implications for Parasite Transmission
AB One important paradigm in host-parasite evolutionary biology is the ability of parasites to manipulate the phenotype of their hosts to facilitate transmission. In this paper, I examine whether the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi modifies the developmental time, body size, and survival of its vector, the bloodsucking insect Mepraia spinolai (Hemiptera; Reduviidae). M. spinolai nymphs were experimentally infected when fed on T. cruzi-infected mice (infected group) or kept uninfected when fed on healthy mice (control group). T. cruzi-infected insects showed a retarded developmental time and reduced survival compared with uninfected individuals. The impact of the parasite on the vector was age-dependent as the last three insect molts were the most affected stages. The presence of T. cruzi decreased significantly the weight of male and female insects in the three last stages. When insect sex was taken into account, infected female bugs took longer than infected males to develop into the adult stage, which implies that the impact of T. cruzi is sex-dependent. Results from this study indicate that T. cruzi has a strong impact on life history traits of M. spinolai and provide strong evidence of age-and sex-dependent parasite-induced phenotype modification for insect vectors. The implications of this study along with previously reported feeding behavioral alterations in this insect vector-parasite system suggest that T. cruzi-induced modifications could translate into an enhanced transmission to definitive mammal hosts.

TI Massilia Virus, A Novel Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae) Isolated from
   Sandflies in the Mediterranean
AB A new virus was isolated from three independent pools of Phlebotomus perniciosus sandflies (Diptera; Psychodidae) trapped in two regions of southeastern France, located 90 miles apart. Microscopic, antigenic and genetic analyses indicate that this novel virus belongs to the genus Phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. The new virus is designated Massilia virus since the first isolate was obtained from sandflies collected in the suburban area of Marseille. The complete genome sequence was determined and used to compare the genetic and phylogenetic relationships of Massilia virus with other phleboviruses. Genetic and antigenic properties were employed to address whether or not Massilia virus should be considered a new species within the genus, or a member of a previously recognized species. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens, collected from local patients with central nervous system infections during the previous four-year period were tested for the presence of Massilia virus RNA, but gave negative results. In conclusion, Massilia virus is proposed as a member of the Sandfly fever Naples virus complex; its public health importance has yet to be determined.

TI How sea lice from salmon farms may cause wild salmonid declines in
   Europe and North America and be a threat to fishes elsewhere
AB Fishes farmed in sea pens may become infested by parasites from wild fishes and in turn become point sources for parasites. Sea lice, copepods of the family Caligidae, are the best-studied example of this risk. Sea lice are the most significant parasitic pathogen in salmon farming in Europe and the Americas, are estimated to cost the world industry (sic)300 million a year and may also be pathogenic to wild fishes under natural conditions. Epizootics, characteristically dominated by juvenile (copepodite and chalimus) stages, have repeatedly occurred on juvenile wild salmonids in areas where farms have sea lice infestations, but have not been recorded elsewhere. This paper synthesizes the literature, including modelling studies, to provide an understanding of how one species, the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, can infest wild salmonids from farm sources. Three-dimensional hydrographic models predicted the distribution of the planktonic salmon lice larvae best when they accounted for wind-driven surface currents and larval behaviour. Caligus species can also cause problems on farms and transfer from farms to wild fishes, and this genus is cosmopolitan. Sea lice thus threaten finfish farming worldwide, but with the possible exception of L. salmonis, their host relationships and transmission adaptations are unknown. The increasing evidence that lice from farms can be a significant cause of mortality on nearby wild fish populations provides an additional challenge to controlling lice on the farms and also raises conservation, economic and political issues about how to balance aquaculture and fisheries resource management.

TI Vertical Transmission of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) from Mothers Negative
   for HBV Surface Antigen and Positive for Antibody to HBV Core Antigen
AB Background. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be transmitted by blood donors and organ donors who are positive for antibody to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) but negative for all other HBV markers. Therefore, we evaluated the risk of infection for babies of mothers with this serostatus.
   Methods. A total of 2365 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative pregnant women were included in the study and screened for anti-HBc. Blood samples for screening were collected 1 day before or after delivery. Infants of mothers with positive anti-HBc test results were tested 3-4 months after birth.
   Results. Of 2365 mothers, 147 (6.2%) were anti-HBc positive. Follow-up tests were performed using samples from 105 children. Samples were tested for all HBV markers, including HBV DNA, which was evaluated using a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction assay (Taq PCR). Seven children (6.6%) had markers of HBV infection; the Taq PCR detected HBV DNA in 5, and HBsAg was detected in the other 2.
   Conclusions. This study shows that HBV can be transmitted perinatally even in the absence of HBsAg. None of the children developed chronic HBV infection. Further studies must determine whether routine immunization of infants at the age of 3 months gives enough protection against HBV infection or whether screening of pregnant women for HBV should be extended, with immunization of their newborns beginning immediately after birth.

TI Heritable Factors Play a Major Role in Determining Host Responses to
   Wuchereria bancrofti Infection in an Isolated South Pacific Island
   Population
AB Background. It is increasingly recognized that host genetic factors may play an important role in determining the outcome of filarial infections. To test this hypothesis in bancroftian lymphatic filariasis, pedigree data were collected twice during an 18-year period from an isolated Polynesian population living on a Pacific island where lymphatic filariasis is endemic.
   Methods. Using variance-component analysis, we examined the contribution of shared genetic and environmental effects on host clinical and immune responses to filarial infection, along with potential confounding determinants.
   Results. Sex was found to have a negligible influence on heritability estimates, but shared-household effects accounted for up to 32% of host variability. After accounting for these shared-household effects, heritability estimates suggested that levels of microfilariae and circulating adult worm antigen, as well as host eosinophil and immunoglobulin G antibody responses to larval and adult worm antigens, were highly heritable (range of heritability estimates, 0.15-0.84).
   Conclusions. These data provide evidence of a key role for genetic factors in determining the host response to filarial infections in humans and emphasize the complexity of the relationships among the host, parasite, and environment.

TI Filter-feeding bivalves can remove avian influenza viruses from water
   and reduce infectivity
AB Avian influenza (AI) viruses are believed to be transmitted within wild aquatic bird populations through an indirect faecal-oral route involving contaminated water. This study examined the influence of filter-feeding bivalves, Corbicula fluminea, on the infectivity of AI virus in water. Clams were placed into individual flasks with distilled water inoculated 1 : 100 with a low pathogenic (LP) AI virus (A/Mallard/MN/190/99 (H3N8)). Viral titres in water with clams were significantly lower at 24 and 48 h post-inoculation compared to LPAI-infected water without clams. To determine whether clams affected the infectivity of AI viruses, 18 wood ducks (Aix sponsa) were divided into test groups and inoculated with a variety of treatments of clam supernatants, whole clams and water exposed to a high pathogenic (HP) AI (A/whooper swan/Mongolia/244/05 (H5N1)). None of the wood ducks inoculated with HPAI-infected water that was filtered by clams or that was inoculated with or fed tissue from these clams exhibited morbidity or mortality. All wood ducks exposed to either HPAI-infected water without clams or the original viral inoculum died. These results indicate that filter-feeding bivalves can remove and reduce the infectivity of AI viruses in water and demonstrate the need to examine biotic environmental factors that can influence AI virus transmission.

TI Effects of Latitude and Longitude on the Population Structure of Culex
   pipiens s.l., Vectors of West Nile Virus in North America
AB We assessed the structure and latitudinal selection that might result in sensitivities to critical day-lengths that trigger diapause between Cidex pipiens populations distributed along North-South and East-West axes in eastern North America. Strong Population structure between Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus existed. Among Cx. p. pipiens, a 100-km increase in the latitudinal change resulted in an increased square root of F-ST by 0.002. A 100-km increase in the longitudinal change caused an increased square root of F-ST by 0.035. A lack of latitudinal influence on the structure between Cx. p. pipiens populations suggests a uniform signal using the 1.2 microsatellite markers, which might increase the risk of West Nile virus (WNV) transmission toward northern areas because of longer breeding season, extend host-seeking period, and larger population size. Northern Cx. p. pipiens may have undergone additional generations before diapause is triggered, magnifying population size when WNV amplification is peaking.

TI Population Seroprevalence of Hepatitis E Virus Antibodies in Rural
   Bangladesh
AB Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes a substantial burden of sporadic and epidemic disease worldwide. HEV infections result in serious morbidity and mortality, especially among pregnant women, and have significant economic costs. Few population-based studies have characterized the epidemiology of HEV. A rural Bangladeshi population was studied to determine the age- and gender-specific population seroprevalence of antibodies to HEV. 017 1,134 specimens tested from a representative, random population sample, 255 (22.5%) were anti-HEV IgG seropositive. Seroprevalence was lower among women (19.7%) than among men (25.8%). We found anti-HBc (hepatitis B core) in 380 of 1.080(35.2%) tested, anti-HCV (hepatitis C) in 14 of 91.7(1.5%) tested, and anti-HAV (hepatitis A) in 116 of 124(93.5%) tested individuals. Our data suggest that viral hepatitis, especially HEV, remains an under-recognized and significant public health problem in rural Bangladeshi populations, warranting further attention.

TI Dispersal and natural enemies interact to drive spatial synchrony and
   decrease stability in patchy populations
AB Spatial synchrony is widespread in natural populations but the mechanisms that underpin it are not yet fully understood. Two key biotic drivers of spatial synchrony have been identified: dispersal and trophic interactions (e.g. natural enemies). We used spatially structured, patchy bacterial populations to show that although increased dispersal always enhanced spatial synchrony of fluctuations in bacterial abundance, this effect was far stronger in the presence of a bacteriophage parasite. Bacteriophages drove strong within patch fluctuations in bacterial abundance that became phase locked through dispersal. Furthermore, the way in which stability, measured as constancy, responded to increasing dispersal was qualitatively different depending on whether parasites were present or not. Patch-level constancy decreased with dispersal in the presence of parasites, whereas dispersal increased patch-level constancy in the absence of parasites. Population-level constancy also decreased with dispersal in the presence of parasites, but was unaffected by dispersal in the absence of parasites. These contrasting patterns were likely due to the different role played by dispersal in the presence and absence of parasites, synchronizing dynamics in the former case and averaging stochastic fluctuations in the latter. Taken together, our findings suggest that dispersal and natural enemies can interact to drive spatially synchronous population fluctuations that decrease stability at both the patch and population level.

TI Assessing the risk from emerging infections
AB Emerging infections pose a constant threat to society and can require a substantial response, thus systems to assess the threat level and inform prioritization of resources are essential. A systematic approach to assessing the risk from emerging infections to public health in the UK has been developed. This qualitative assessment of risk is performed using algorithms to consider the probability of an Infection entering the UK Population, and its potential impact, and to identify knowledge gaps. The risk assessments are carried out by a multidisciplinary, cross-governmental group of experts working in human and animal health. This approach has been piloted on a range of infectious threats identified by horizon scanning activities. A formal risk assessment of this nature should be considered for any new or emerging infection in humans or animals, unless there is good evidence that the infection is neither a recognized human disease nor a potential zoonosis.

TI The changing panorama of bacterial enteric infections
AB We studied the age-specific population-based incidence of bacterial enteric infections caused by Shigella, Salmonella and Campylobacter, in Jerusalem. During 1990-2008, 32408 cases were reported (incidence rate 232.1/100000 per annum). The patterns of Shigella (47.4% of cases), Salmonella (34.4 %) and Campylobacter (18.2 %) infections evolved noticeably. Campylobacter rates increased from 15.0 to 110.8/100 000 per annum. Salmonella rates increased from 74.2 to 199.6/100 000 in 1995 then decreased to 39.4/100 000. Shigella showed ail endemic/epidemic pattern ranging between 19.7 and 252.8/100 000. Most patients (75 %) were aged < 15 years; children aged <5 years comprised 56.4 % of cases, despite accounting for only 12.9 % of the population. Campylobacter was the predominant organism in infants aged <1 year and Shigella in the 1-4 years group. The hospitalization rates were: Shigella, 1.8 %; Campylobacter, 2.3 %; Salmonella, 6.9%. Infants were 2.2 times more likely to be hospitalized than children aged 1-14 years (P=0.001). Household transmission occurred in 21.2% of Shigella cases compared with 5 % in the other bacteria.

   significance of a common but neglected parasite
AB Two independent studies were conducted to describe symptoms and potential risk factors associated with Blastocystis infection. Isolates were subtyped by molecular analysis. In the NORMAT study (126 individuals randomly sampled from the general population) 24 (19 %) were positive for Blastocystis. Blastocystis was associated with irritable bowel syndrome (P = 0.04), contact with pigs (P<0.01) and poultry (P=0.03). In the Follow-up (FU) study (follow-up of 92 Blastocystis-positive patients), reports on bloating were associated with subtype (ST) 2 (P<0.01), and blood in stool to mixed subtype infection (P=0.06). STI was more common in FU individuals (32 %) than in NORMAT individuals (8%), whereas single subtype infections due to ST3 or ST4 were seen in 63% of the NORMAT cases and 28 % of the FU cases. Only FU individuals hosted ST7, and ST6/7 infections due to ST7 or ST9 were characterized by multiple intestinal symptoms. The data indicate subtype-dependent differences in the clinical significance of Blastocystis.

TI EVOLUTION AND MANIPULATION OF PARASITOID EGG LOAD
AB In proovigenic parasitoids such as Leptopilina boulardi, the female emerges with a limited egg load and no further eggs are produced during its adult life. A female thus runs the risk of exhausting this limited supply of eggs before the end of her life. Given that the production of an egg is costly, what is the evolutionarily stable egg load at emergence? This question has attracted a lot of attention in the last decade. Here, we analyze a model that allows us to track both the evolution and the population dynamics of a solitary, proovigenic parasitoid. First, we show how host-parasitoid dynamics feedbacks on the evolution of parasitoid egg load. Second, we use this model to consider the situation in which the parasitoid can be infected by a virus that manipulates the oviposition behavior of the females. In particular, we model the effect of the LbFV virus in L. boulardi, a virus that is known to enhance its horizontal transmission by increasing superparasitism (i.e., the laying of eggs in a host already parasitized). Specifically, we model (1) the effect of the virus on parasitoid egg load strategies, and (2) the evolution of egg load manipulation by the virus. This analysis yields two alternative, yet not mutually exclusive, adaptive explanations for the observation that females infected by the virus harbor higher egg loads than uninfected females. Infected females could either respond plastically to the infection status, or be manipulated by the virus. Further experimental work is required to distinguish between these two hypotheses. In a broader context, we present a general theoretical framework that allows us to study the epidemiology, the evolution, the coevolution, and the evolution of manipulation of various reproductive strategies of parasitoids.

TI Ecological feedbacks and the evolution of resistance
AB P> The idea that parasites can affect host diversity is pervasive, and the possibility that parasites can increase host diversity is of particular interest. In this review, we focus on diversity in the resistance of hosts to their parasites, and on the different ways in which parasites can increase or decrease this resistance diversity.
   Theoretically, parasites can exert many different types of selection on host populations, which each have consequences for host diversity. Specifically, theory predicts that parasites can exert negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) and disruptive selection on resistance, both of which increase host diversity, as well as directional selection and stabilizing selection on resistance, both of which decrease host diversity.
   Despite these theoretical predictions, most biologists think of only NFDS or directional selection for increased resistance in response to parasitism. Here, we present empirical support for all of these types of selection occurring in natural populations. Interestingly, several recent studies demonstrate that there is spatiotemporal variation in the type of selection that occurs (and, therefore, in the effects of parasitism on host diversity).
   A key question that remains, then, is: What determines the type of parasite-mediated selection that occurs? Theory demonstrates that the answer to this question lies, at least in part, with trade-offs associated with resistance. Specifically, the type of evolution that occurs depends critically on the strength and shape of these trade-offs. This, combined with empirical evidence for a strong effect of environment on the shape and strength of trade-offs, may explain the observed spatiotemporal variation in parasite-mediated selection.
   We conclude that spatiotemporal variation in parasite-driven evolution is likely to be common, and that this variation may be driven by ecological factors. We suggest that the feedback between ecological and evolutionary dynamics in host-parasite interactions is likely to be a productive area of research. In particular, studies addressing the role of ecological factors (e.g. productivity and predation regimes) in driving the outcome of parasite-mediated selection on host populations are warranted. Such studies are necessary if we are to understand the mechanisms underlying the observed variation in the effects of parasites on host diversity.

TI Encapsulated Bacillus anthracis Interacts Closely with Liver Endothelium
AB Background. The Bacillus anthracis poly-gamma-D-glutamate capsule is essential for virulence. It impedes phagocytosis and protects bacilli from the immune system, thus promoting systemic dissemination.
   Methods. To further define the virulence mechanisms brought into play by the capsule, we characterized the interactions between encapsulated nontoxinogenic B. anthracis and its host in vivo through histological analysis, perfusion, and competition experiments with purified capsule.
   Results. Clearance of encapsulated bacilli from the blood was rapid (>90% clearance within 5 min), with 75% of the bacteria being trapped in the liver. Competition experiments with purified capsule polyglutamate inhibited this interaction. At the septicemic phase of cutaneous infection with spores, the encapsulated bacilli were trapped in the vascular spaces of the liver and interacted closely with the liver endothelium in the sinusoids and terminal and portal veins. They often grow as microcolonies containing capsular material shed by the bacteria.
   Conclusion. We show that, in addition to its inhibitory effect on the interaction with the immune system, the capsule surrounding B. anthracis plays an active role in mediating the trapping of the bacteria within the liver and may thus contribute to anthrax pathogenesis. Because other microorganisms produce polyglutamate, it may also represent a general mechanism of virulence or in vivo survival.

TI Recent evolution of host-associated divergence in the seabird tick
   Ixodes uriae
AB Ecological interactions are an important source of rapid evolutionary change and thus may generate a significant portion of novel biodiversity. Such changes may be particularly prevalent in parasites, where hosts can induce strong selection for adaptation. To understand the relative frequency at which host-associated divergences occur, it is essential to examine the evolutionary history of the divergence process, particularly when it is occurring over large geographical scales where both geographical and host-associated isolation may playa part. In this study, we use population genetics and phylogeography to study the evolutionary history of host-associated divergence in the seabird tick Ixodes uriae (Acari, Ixodidae). We compare results from microsatellite markers that reflect more ecological timescales with a conserved mitochondrial gene (COIII) that reflects more ancient divergence events. Population structure based on microsatellites showed clear evidence of host-associated divergence in all colonies examined. However, isolated populations of the same host type did not always group together in overall analyses and the genetic differentiation among sympatric host races was highly variable. In contrast, little host or geographical structure was found for the mitochondrial gene fragment. These results suggest that host race formation in I. uriae is a recent phenomenon, that it may have occurred several times and that local interactions are at different points in the divergence process. Rapid divergence in I. uriae implies a strong interaction with its local host species, an interaction that will alter the ecological dynamics of the system and modify the epidemiological landscape of circulating micropathogens.

TI Pathogens as potential selective agents in the wild
AB Pathogens are considered a serious threat to which wild populations must adapt, most particularly under conditions of rapid environmental change. One way host adaptation has been studied is through genetic population structure at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a complex of adaptive genes involved in pathogen resistance in vertebrates. However, while associations between specific pathogens and MHC alleles or diversity have been documented from laboratory studies, the interaction between hosts and pathogens in the wild is more complex. As such, identifying selective agents and understanding underlying co-evolutionary mechanisms remains a major challenge. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Evans & Neff (2009) characterized spatial and temporal variation in the bacterial parasite community infecting Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry from five populations in British Columbia, Canada. They used a 16S rDNA sequencing-based approach to examine the prevalence of bacterial infection in kidney and looked for associations with MHC class I and II genetic variability. The authors found a high diversity of bacteria infecting fry, albeit at low prevalence. It was reasoned that spatial variability in infection rate and bacterial community phylogenetic similarity found across populations may represent differential pathogen-mediated selection pressures. The study revealed some evidence of heterozygote advantage at MHC class II, but not class I, and preliminary associations between specific MHC alleles and bacterial infections were uncovered. This research adds an interesting perspective to the debate on host-pathogen co-evolutionary mechanisms and emphasizes the importance of considering the complexity of pathogen communities in studies of host local adaptation.

TI Contrasting mtDNA diversity and population structure in a
   direct-developing marine gastropod and its trematode parasites
AB The comparative genetic structure of hosts and their parasites has important implications for their coevolution, but has been investigated in relatively few systems. In this study, we analysed the genetic structure and diversity of the New Zealand intertidal snail Zeacumantus subcarinatus (n = 330) and two of its trematode parasites, Maritrema novaezealandensis (n = 269) and Philophthalmus sp. (n = 246), using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) sequences. Snails and trematodes were examined from 11 collection sites representing three regions on the South Island of New Zealand. Zeacumantus subcarinatus displayed low genetic diversity per geographic locality, strong genetic structure following an isolation by distance pattern, and low migration rates at the scale of the study. In contrast, M. novaezealandensis possessed high genetic diversity, genetic homogeneity among collection sites and high migration rates. Genetic diversity and migration rates were typically lower for Philophthalmus sp. compared to M. novaezealandensis and it displayed weak to moderate genetic structure. The observed patterns likely result from the limited dispersal ability of the direct developing snail and the utilization of bird definitive hosts by the trematodes. In addition, snails may occasionally experience long-distance dispersal. Discrepancies between trematode species may result from differences in their effective population sizes and/or life history traits.

TI Major histocompatibility complex heterozygote advantage and widespread
   bacterial infections in populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
   tshawytscha)
AB Despite growing evidence for parasite-mediated selection on the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (MHC), little is known about variation in the bacterial parasite community within and among host populations or its influence on MHC evolution. In this study, we characterize variation in the parasitic bacterial community associated with Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry in five populations in British Columbia (BC), Canada across 2 years, and examine whether bacterial infections are a potential source of selection on the MHC. We found an unprecedented diversity of bacteria infecting fry with a total of 55 unique bacteria identified. Bacterial infection rates varied from 9% to 29% among populations and there was a significant isolation by distance relationship in bacterial community phylogenetic similarity across the populations. Spatial variation in the frequency of infections and in the phylogenetic similarity of bacterial communities may result in differential parasite-mediated selection at the MHC across populations. Across all populations, we found evidence of a heterozygote advantage at the MHC class II, which may be a source of balancing selection on this locus. Interestingly, a co-inertia analysis indicated only susceptibility associations between a few of the MHC class I and II alleles and specific bacterial parasites; there was no evidence that any of the alleles provided resistance to the bacteria. Our results reveal a complex bacterial community infecting populations of a fish and underscore the importance of considering the role of multiple pathogens in the evolution of host adaptations.

TI Identifying Changes in Selective Constraints: Host Shifts in Influenza
AB The natural reservoir of Influenza A is waterfowl. Normally, waterfowl viruses are not adapted to infect and spread in the human population. Sometimes, through reassortment or through whole host shift events, genetic material from waterfowl viruses is introduced into the human population causing worldwide pandemics. Identifying which mutations allow viruses from avian origin to spread successfully in the human population is of great importance in predicting and controlling influenza pandemics. Here we describe a novel approach to identify such mutations. We use a sitewise non-homogeneous phylogenetic model that explicitly takes into account differences in the equilibrium frequencies of amino acids in different hosts and locations. We identify 172 amino acid sites with strong support and 518 sites with moderate support of different selection constraints in human and avian viruses. The sites that we identify provide an invaluable resource to experimental virologists studying adaptation of avian flu viruses to the human host. Identification of the sequence changes necessary for host shifts would help us predict the pandemic potential of various strains. The method is of broad applicability to investigating changes in selective constraints when the timing of the changes is known.

TI Molecular Characterization of the Schistosoma mansoni Zinc Finger
   Protein SmZF1 as a Transcription Factor
AB Background: During its development, the parasite Schistosoma mansoni is exposed to different environments and undergoes many morphological and physiological transformations as a result of profound changes in gene expression. Characterization of proteins involved in the regulation of these processes is of importance for the understanding of schistosome biology. Proteins containing zinc finger motifs usually participate in regulatory processes and are considered the major class of transcription factors in eukaryotes. It has already been shown, by EMSA (Eletrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay), that SmZF1, a S. mansoni zinc finger (ZF) protein, specifically binds both DNA and RNA oligonucleotides. This suggests that this protein might act as a transcription factor in the parasite.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we extended the characterization of SmZF1 by determining its subcellular localization and by verifying its ability to regulate gene transcription. We performed immunohistochemistry assays using adult male and female worms, cercariae and schistosomula to analyze the distribution pattern of SmZF1 and verified that the protein is mainly detected in the cells nuclei of all tested life cycle stages except for adult female worms. Also, SmZF1 was heterologously expressed in mammalian COS-7 cells to produce the recombinant protein YFP-SmZF1, which was mainly detected in the nucleus of the cells by confocal microscopy and Western blot assays. To evaluate the ability of this protein to regulate gene transcription, cells expressing YFP-SmZF1 were tested in a luciferase reporter system. In this system, the luciferase gene is downstream of a minimal promoter, upstream of which a DNA region containing four copies of the SmZF1 putative best binding site (D1-3DNA) was inserted. SmZF1 increased the reporter gene transcription by two fold (p <= 0.003) only when its specific binding site was present.
   Conclusion: Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that SmZF1 acts as a transcription factor in S. mansoni.

TI Spatial Evaluation and Modeling of Dengue Seroprevalence and Vector
   Density in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
AB Background: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, experienced a severe dengue fever epidemic in 2008. This was the worst epidemic ever, characterized by a sharp increase in case-fatality rate, mainly among younger individuals. A combination of factors, such as climate, mosquito abundance, buildup of the susceptible population, or viral evolution, could explain the severity of this epidemic. The main objective of this study is to model the spatial patterns of dengue seroprevalence in three neighborhoods with different socioeconomic profiles in Rio de Janeiro. As blood sampling coincided with the peak of dengue transmission, we were also able to identify recent dengue infections and visually relate them to Aedes aegypti spatial distribution abundance. We analyzed individual and spatial factors associated with seroprevalence using Generalized Additive Model (GAM).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Three neighborhoods were investigated: a central urban neighborhood, and two isolated areas characterized as a slum and a suburban area. Weekly mosquito collections started in September 2006 and continued until March 2008. In each study area, 40 adult traps and 40 egg traps were installed in a random sample of premises, and two infestation indexes calculated: mean adult density and mean egg density. Sera from individuals living in the three neighborhoods were collected before the 2008 epidemic (July through November 2007) and during the epidemic (February through April 2008). Sera were tested for DENV-reactive IgM, IgG, Nested RT-PCR, and Real Time RT-PCR. From the before-after epidemics paired data, we described seroprevalence, recent dengue infections (asymptomatic or not), and seroconversion. Recent dengue infection varied from 1.3% to 14.1% among study areas. The highest IgM seropositivity occurred in the slum, where mosquito abundance was the lowest, but household conditions were the best for promoting contact between hosts and vectors. By fitting spatial GAM we found dengue seroprevalence hotspots located at the entrances of the two isolated communities, which are commercial activity areas with high human movement. No association between recent dengue infection and household's high mosquito abundance was observed in this sample.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study contributes to better understanding the dynamics of dengue in Rio de Janeiro by assessing the relationship between dengue seroprevalence, recent dengue infection, and vector density. In conclusion, the variation in spatial seroprevalence patterns inside the neighborhoods, with significantly higher risk patches close to the areas with large human movement, suggests that humans may be responsible for virus inflow to small neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro. Surveillance guidelines should be further discussed, considering these findings, particularly the spatial patterns for both human and mosquito populations.

TI Characterizing the Aedes aegypti Population in a Vietnamese Village in
   Preparation for a Wolbachia-Based Mosquito Control Strategy to Eliminate
   Dengue
AB Background: A life-shortening strain of the obligate intracellular bacteria Wolbachia, called wMelPop, is seen as a promising new tool for the control of Aedes aegypti. However, developing a vector control strategy based on the release of mosquitoes transinfected with wMelPop requires detailed knowledge of the demographics of the target population.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In Tri Nguyen village (611 households) on Hon Mieu Island in central Vietnam, we conducted nine quantitative entomologic surveys over 14 months to determine if Ae. aegypti populations were spatially and temporally homogenous, and to estimate population size. There was no obvious relationship between mosquito (larval, pupal or adult) abundance and temperature and rainfall, and no area of the village supported consistently high numbers of mosquitoes. In almost all surveys, key premises produced high numbers of Ae. aegypti. However, these premises were not consistent between surveys. For an intervention based on a single release of wMelPop-infected Ae. aegypti, release ratios of infected to uninfected adult mosquitoes of all age classes are estimated to be 1.8-6.7:1 for gravid females (and similarly aged males) or teneral adults, respectively. We calculated that adult female mosquito abundance in Tri Nguyen village could range from 1.1 to 43.3 individuals of all age classes per house. Thus, an intervention could require the release of 2-78 wMelPop-infected gravid females and similarly aged males per house, or 7-290 infected teneral female and male mosquitoes per house.
   Conclusions/Significance: Given the variability we encountered, this study highlights the importance of multiple entomologic surveys when evaluating the spatial structure of a vector population or estimating population size. If a single release of wMelPop-infected Ae. aegypti were to occur when wild Ae. aegypti abundance was at its maximum, a preintervention control program would be necessary to ensure that there was no net increase in mosquito numbers. However, because of the short-term temporal heterogeneity, the inconsistent spatial structure and the impact of transient key premises that we observed, the feasibility of multiple releases of smaller numbers of mosquitoes also needs to be considered. In either case, fewer wMelPop-infected mosquitoes would then need to be released, which will likely be more acceptable to householders.

TI Prevalence and Risk Factors of Lassa Seropositivity in Inhabitants of
   the Forest Region of Guinea: A Cross-Sectional Study
AB Background: Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa. The reservoir host of the virus is a multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis. Prevalence estimates of Lassa virus antibodies in humans vary greatly between studies, and the main modes of transmission of the virus from rodents to humans remain unclear. We aimed to (i) estimate the prevalence of Lassa virus-specific IgG antibodies (LV IgG) in the human population of a rural area of Guinea, and (ii) identify risk factors for positive LV IgG.
   Methods and Findings: A population-based cross-sectional study design was used. In April 2000, all individuals one year of age and older living in three prefectures located in the tropical secondary forest area of Guinea (Gueckedou, Lola and Yomou) were sampled using two-stage cluster sampling. For each individual identified by the sampling procedure and who agreed to participate, a standardized questionnaire was completed to collect data on personal exposure to potential risk factors for Lassa fever (mainly contact with rodents), and a blood sample was tested for LV IgG. A multiple logistic regression model was used to determine risk factors for positive LV IgG. A total of 1424 subjects were interviewed and 977 sera were tested. Prevalence of positive LV Ig was of 12.9% [10.8%-15.0%] and 10.0% [8.1%-11.9%] in rural and urban areas, respectively. Two risk factors of positive LV IgG were identified: to have, in the past twelve months, undergone an injection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8 [1.1-3.1]), or lived with someone displaying a haemorrhage (OR = 1.7 [1.1-2.9]). No factors related to contacts with rats and/or mice remained statistically significant in the multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: Our study underlines the potential importance of person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever, via close contact in the same household or nosocomial exposure.

TI Role of the Endogenous Antioxidant System in the Protection of
   Schistosoma mansoni Primary Sporocysts against Exogenous Oxidative
   Stress
AB Antioxidants produced by the parasite Schistosoma mansoni are believed to be involved in the maintenance of cellular redox balance, thus contributing to larval survival in their intermediate snail host, Biomphalaria glabrata. Here, we focused on specific antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione-S-transferases 26 and 28 (GST26 and 28), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), peroxiredoxin 1 and 2 (Prx1 and 2) and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), known to be involved in cellular redox reactions, in an attempt to evaluate their endogenous antioxidant function in the early-developing primary sporocyst stage of S. mansoni. Previously we demonstrated a specific and consistent RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of GST26 and 28, Prx1 and 2, and GPx transcripts, and an unexpected elevation of SOD transcripts in sporocysts treated with gene-specific double-stranded (ds) RNA. In the present followup study, in vitro transforming sporocysts were exposed to dsRNAs for GST26 and 28, combined Prx1/2, GPx, SOD or green-fluorescent protein (GFP, control) for 7 days in culture, followed by assessment of the effects of specific dsRNA treatments on protein levels using semi-quantitative Western blot analysis (GST26, Prx1/2 only), and larval susceptibility to exogenous oxidative stress in in vitro killing assays. Significant decreases (80% and 50%) in immunoreactive GST26 and Prx1/2, respectively, were observed in sporocysts treated with specific dsRNA, compared to control larvae treated with GFP dsRNA. Sporocysts cultured with dsRNAs for GST26, GST28, Prx1/2 and GPx, but not SOD dsRNA, were significantly increased in their susceptibility to H(2)O(2) oxidative stress (60-80% mortalities at 48 hr) compared to GFP dsRNA controls (similar to 18% mortality). H(2)O(2)-mediated killing was abrogated by bovine catalase, further supporting a protective role for endogenous sporocyst antioxidants. Finally, in vitro killing of S. mansoni sporocysts by hemocytes of susceptible NMRI B. glabrata snails was increased in larvae treated with Prx1/2, GST26 and GST28 dsRNA, compared to those treated with GFP or SOD dsRNAs. Results of these experiments strongly support the hypothesis that endogenous expression and regulation of larval antioxidant enzymes serve a direct role in protection against external oxidative stress, including immune-mediated cytotoxic reactions. Moreover, these findings illustrate the efficacy of a RNAi-type approach in investigating gene function in larval schistosomes.

TI Mycolactone Gene Expression Is Controlled by Strong SigA-Like Promoters
   with Utility in Studies of Mycobacterium ulcerans and Buruli Ulcer
AB Mycolactone A/B is a lipophilic macrocyclic polyketide that is the primary virulence factor produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, a human pathogen and the causative agent of Buruli ulcer. In M. ulcerans strain Agy99 the mycolactone polyketide synthase (PKS) locus spans a 120 kb region of a 174 kb megaplasmid. Here we have identified promoter regions of this PKS locus using GFP reporter assays, in silico analysis, primer extension, and site-directed mutagenesis. Transcription of the large PKS genes mlsA1 (51 kb), mlsA2 (7 kb) and mlsB (42 kb) is driven by a novel and powerful SigA-like promoter sequence situated 533 bp upstream of both the mlsA1 and mlsB initiation codons, which is also functional in Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium marinum. Promoter regions were also identified upstream of the putative mycolactone accessory genes mup045 and mup053. We transformed M. ulcerans with a GFP-reporter plasmid under the control of the mls promoter to produce a highly green-fluorescent bacterium. The strain remained virulent, producing both GFP and mycolactone and causing ulcerative disease in mice. Mosquitoes have been proposed as a potential vector of M. ulcerans so we utilized M. ulcerans-GFP in microcosm feeding experiments with captured mosquito larvae. M. ulcerans-GFP accumulated within the mouth and midgut of the insect over four instars, whereas the closely related, non-mycolactone-producing species M. marinum harbouring the same GFP reporter system did not. This is the first report to identify M. ulcerans toxin gene promoters, and we have used our findings to develop M. ulcerans-GFP, a strain in which fluorescence and toxin gene expression are linked, thus providing a tool for studying Buruli ulcer pathogenesis and potential transmission to humans.

TI Evidence for regular ongoing introductions of mosquito disease vectors
   into the Galapagos Islands
AB Wildlife on isolated oceanic islands is highly susceptible to the introduction of pathogens. The recent establishment in the Galapagos Islands of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, a vector for diseases such as avian malaria and West Nile fever, is considered a serious risk factor for the archipelago's endemic fauna. Here we present evidence from the monitoring of aeroplanes and genetic analysis that C. quinquefasciatus is regularly introduced via aircraft into the Galapagos Archipelago. Genetic population structure and admixture analysis demonstrates that these mosquitoes breed with, and integrate successfully into, already-established populations of C. quinquefasciatus in the Galapagos, and that there is ongoing movement of mosquitoes between islands. Tourist cruise boats and inter-island boat services are the most likely mechanism for transporting Culex mosquitoes between islands. Such anthropogenic mosquito movements increase the risk of the introduction of mosquito-borne diseases novel to Galapagos and their subsequent widespread dissemination across the archipelago. Failure to implement and maintain measures to prevent the human-assisted transport of mosquitoes to and among the islands could have catastrophic consequences for the endemic wildlife of Galapagos.

TI Longicorn beetle that vectors pinewood nematode carries many Wolbachia
   genes on an autosome
AB Monochamus alternatus is the longicorn beetle notorious as a vector of the pinewood nematode that causes the pine wilt disease. When two populations of M. alternatus were subjected to diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of four Wolbachia genes, only the ftsZ gene was detected from one of the populations. The Wolbachia ftsZ gene persisted even after larvae were fed with a tetracycline-containing diet for six weeks. The inheritance of the ftsZ gene was not maternal but biparental, exhibiting a typical Mendelian pattern. The ftsZ gene titres in homozygotic ftsZ(+) insects were nearly twice as high as those in heterozygotic ftsZ(+) insects. Exhaustive PCR surveys revealed that 31 and 30 of 214 Wolbachia genes examined were detected from the two insect populations, respectively. Many of these Wolbachia genes contained stop codon(s) and/or frame shift(s). Fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed the location of the Wolbachia genes on an autosome. On the basis of these results, we conclude that a large Wolbachia genomic region has been transferred to and located on an autosome of M. alternatus. The discovery of massive gene transfer from Wolbachia to M. alternatus would provide further insights into the evolution and fate of laterally transferred endosymbiont genes in multicellular host organisms.

TI Submicroscopic Infection in Plasmodium falciparum-Endemic Populations: A
   Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
AB Introduction. Light microscopy examination of blood slides is the main method of detecting malaria infection; however, it has limited sensitivity. Low-density infections are most likely to be missed, but they contribute to the infectious reservoir. Quantifying these submicroscopic infections is therefore key to understanding transmission dynamics and successfully reducing parasite transmission.
   Methods. We conducted a systematic review of endemic population surveys in which P. falciparum prevalence had been measured by both microscopy and a more-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique. The combined microscopy: PCR prevalence ratio was estimated by random-effects meta-analysis, and the effect of covariates was determined by meta-regression.
   Results. Seventy-two pairs of prevalence measurements were included in the study. The prevalence of infection measured by microscopy was, on average, 50.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45.2%-57.1%) of that measured by PCR. For gametocyte-specific detection, the microscopy prevalence was, on average, 8.7% (95% CI, 2.8%-26.6%) of the prevalence measured by PCR. A significantly higher percentage of total infections was detected by microscopy in areas of high, compared with low, transmission (74.5% when the prevalence determined by PCR was 175% versus 12.0% when the prevalence determined by PCR was <10%).
   Discussion. Microscopy can miss a substantial proportion of P. falciparum infections in surveys of endemic populations, especially in areas with low transmission of infection. The extent of the submicroscopic reservoir needs to be taken into account for effective surveillance and control.

TI Hosts as ecological traps for the vector of Lyme disease
AB Vectors of infectious diseases are generally thought to be regulated by abiotic conditions such as climate or the availability of specific hosts or habitats. In this study we tested whether blacklegged ticks, the vectors of Lyme disease, granulocytic anaplasmosis and babesiosis can be regulated by the species of vertebrate hosts on which they obligately feed. By subjecting field-caught hosts to parasitism by larval blacklegged ticks, we found that some host species (e.g. opossums, squirrels) that are abundantly parasitized in nature kill 83-96% of the ticks that attempt to attach and feed, while other species are more permissive of tick feeding. Given natural tick burdens we document on these hosts, we show that some hosts can kill thousands of ticks per hectare. These results indicate that the abundance of tick vectors can be regulated by the identity of the hosts upon which these vectors feed. By simulating the removal of hosts from intact communities using empirical models, we show that the loss of biodiversity may exacerbate disease risk by increasing both vector numbers and vector infection rates with a zoonotic pathogen.

TI Competition promotes the evolution of host generalists in obligate
   parasites
AB Ecological theory traditionally predicts that interspecific competition selects for an increase in ecological specialization. Specialization, in turn, is often thought to be an evolutionary 'dead end,' with specialist lineages unlikely to evolve into generalist lineages. In host-parasite systems, this specialization can take the form of host specificity, with more specialized parasites using fewer hosts. We tested the hypothesis that specialists are evolutionarily more derived, and whether competition favours specialization, using the ectoparasitic feather lice of doves. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that complete host specificity is actually the ancestral condition, with generalists repeatedly evolving from specialist ancestors. These multiple origins of generalists are correlated with the presence of potentially competing species of the same genus. A competition experiment with captive doves and lice confirmed that congeneric species of lice do, in fact, have the potential to compete in ecological time. Taken together, these results suggest that interspecific competition can favour the evolution of host generalists, not specialists, over macroevolutionary time.

TI Evolution and emergence of novel human infections
AB Some zoonotic pathogens cause sporadic infection in humans but rarely propagate further, while others have succeeded in overcoming the species barrier and becoming established in the human population. Adaptation, driven by selection pressure in human hosts, can play a significant role in allowing pathogens to cross this species barrier. Here we use a simple mathematical model to study potential epidemiological markers of adaptation. We ask: under what circumstances could ongoing adaptation be signalled by large clusters of human infection? If a pathogen has caused hundreds of cases but with little transmission, does this indicate that the species barrier cannot be crossed? Finally, how can case reports be monitored to detect an imminent emergence event? We distinguish evolutionary scenarios under which adaptation is likely to be signalled by large clusters of infection and under which emergence is likely to occur without any prior warning. Moreover, we show that a lack of transmission never rules out adaptability, regardless of how many zoonoses have occurred. Indeed, after the first 100 zoonotic cases, continuing sporadic zoonotic infections without onward, human-to-human transmission offer little extra information on pathogen adaptability. Finally, we present a simple method for monitoring outbreaks for signs of emergence and discuss public health implications.

TI The Influence of Perenniality and Seed Banks on Polymorphism in
   Plant-Parasite Interactions
AB Antagonistic interactions, such as diseases, play an important role in natural populations. Understanding the mechanisms that promote long-term polymorphism at loci that are involved in host-parasite recognition is a fundamental problem in evolutionary ecology. Coevolution implies the existence of indirect frequency-dependent selection because the fitnesses of parasite genotypes depend on the frequencies of host genes and vice versa. Polymorphism can be maintained in both organisms if there is also negative, direct, frequency-dependent selection, when natural selection for host resistance or parasite virulence declines with increasing frequency of that trait itself. In this article, using the gene-for-gene relationship as a model, we show that two plant life-history traits, seed banks and perenniality with parasite density-dependent disease transmission, generate frequency-dependent selection on host resistance and are thus capable of stabilizing frequencies of coevolving host and parasite genes. The host population's response to selection by the parasite is modified by the contribution of past selective events stored in long-lived seed banks or in a growing population of perennial plants that have a long life span in the absence of disease. While fitness costs determine whether coevolutionary cycles occur in interacting host and parasite populations, the ecology of the two organisms determines whether stable polymorphism is maintained.

TI Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics of Mutualists and Exploiters
AB With the growing recognition of exploiters as a prominent and enduring feature of many mutualisms, there is a need to understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of mutualisms in the context of exploitation. Here, we model coevolution between mutualist and exploiter birth rates, using an obligate pollinating seed parasite mutualism associated with a nonpollinating exploiter as a reference system. In this system, mutualist and exploiter larvae parasitize the host plant, competing for and consuming seeds. Evolution of the mutualist determines which exploiters can invade successfully. Subsequent coevolution with an exploiter has a strong, predictable influence on mutualist-exploiter coexistence, mutualist and exploiter phenotypes, and species abundances. Weak mutualist competition promotes "evolutionary purging" of the exploiter, while weak exploiter competition leads to "evolutionary suicide" of the system. When stable, long-term coexistence occurs, we identify two main "trait-abundance syndromes" that have three novel implications. (1) Persistent, highly parasitic exploiters can be favored by coevolution. (2) Even then, the density of coevolved mutualists can be high. (3) Low plant density results primarily from the evolution of mutualist, not exploiter, birth rate and density. To evaluate these predictions, studies are needed that identify and compare populations with and without exploiters and compare life-history traits of mutualists and exploiters.

TI Inverse-Gene-for-Gene Infection Genetics and Coevolutionary Dynamics
AB The genetic basis of infection in host-parasite interactions has traditionally been considered within the framework of either gene-for-gene (GFG) or matching-allele models. We present an alternative model, termed inverse-gene-for-gene (IGFG), where pathogen infectiousness is determined by parasite recognition of host signals and/or receptors or where there is active host searching by parasites. We show that coevolutionary dynamics under IGFG are both qualitatively and quantitatively different from those of the GFG model, and we suggest that this new approach may be applicable to a range of important host-parasite systems that are not currently catered for by the existing frameworks.

TI Climate Change and the Geographic Distribution of Infectious Diseases
AB Our ability to predict the effects of climate change on the spread of infectious diseases is in its infancy. Numerous, and in some cases conflicting, predictions have been developed, principally based on models of biological processes or mapping of current and historical disease statistics. Current debates on whether climate change, relative to socioeconomic determinants, will be a major influence on human disease distributions are useful to help identify research needs but are probably artificially polarized. We have at least identified many of the critical geophysical constraints, transport opportunities, biotic requirements for some disease systems, and some of the socioeconomic factors that govern the process of migration and establishment of parasites and pathogens. Furthermore, we are beginning to develop a mechanistic understanding of many of these variables at specific sites. Better predictive understanding will emerge in the coming years from analyses regarding how these variables interact with each other.

TI Cross-Species Pathogen Transmission and Disease Emergence in Primates
AB Many of the most virulent emerging infectious diseases in humans, e.g., AIDS and Ebola, are zoonotic, having shifted from wildlife populations. Critical questions for predicting disease emergence are: (1) what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another, and (2) which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift. In wild primates, infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region. Therefore, humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes, which include chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species represent our closest relatives. Geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross-species transmission, but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen. We extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate "hotspot" maps, highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest. We find that central Africa and Amazonia are hotspots for cross-species transmission events between wild primates, due to a high diversity of closely related primate species. Hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west Africa, where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives. These areas also are likely to sustain a novel epidemic due to their rapidly growing human populations, close proximity to apes, and population centers with high density and contact rates among individuals.

TI Correlates of Viral Richness in Bats (Order Chiroptera)
AB Historic and contemporary host ecology and evolutionary dynamics have profound impacts on viral diversity, virulence, and associated disease emergence. Bats have been recognized as reservoirs for several emerging viral pathogens, and are unique among mammals in their vagility, potential for long-distance dispersal, and often very large, colonial populations. We investigate the relative influences of host ecology and population genetic structure for predictions of viral richness in relevant reservoir species. We test the hypothesis that host geographic range area, distribution, population genetic structure, migratory behavior, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) threat status, body mass, and colony size, are associated with known viral richness in bats. We analyze host traits and viral richness in a generalized linear regression model framework, and include a correction for sampling effort and phylogeny. We find evidence that sampling effort, IUCN status, and population genetic structure correlate with observed viral species richness in bats, and that these associations are independent of phylogeny. This study is an important first step in understanding the mechanisms that promote viral richness in reservoir species, and may aid in predicting the emergence of viral zoonoses from bats.

TI Spatial Variation in an Avian Host Community: Implications for Disease
   Dynamics
AB Because many pathogens can infect multiple host species within a community, disease dynamics in a focal host species can be affected by the composition of the host community. We examine the extent to which spatial variation in species' abundances in an avian host community may contribute to geographically varying prevalence of a recently emerged wildlife pathogen. Mycoplasma gallisepticum is a pathogen novel to songbirds that has caused substantial mortality in house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) in eastern North America. Though the house finch is the primary host species for M. gallisepticum, the American goldfinch (Spinus tristis) and northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) are alternate hosts, and laboratory experiments have demonstrated M. gallisepticum transmission between house finches and goldfinches. Still unknown is the real world impact on disease dynamics of variation in abundances of the three hosts. We analyzed data from winter-long bird and disease surveys in the northeastern United States. We found that higher disease prevalence in house finches was associated with higher numbers of northern cardinals and American goldfinches, although only the effect of cardinal abundance was statistically significant. Nevertheless, our results indicate that spatial variation in bird communities has the potential to cause geographic variation in disease prevalence in house finches.

TI A Legacy of Low-Impact Logging does not Elevate Prevalence of
   Potentially Pathogenic Protozoa in Free-Ranging Gorillas and Chimpanzees
   in the Republic of Congo: Logging and Parasitism in African Apes
AB Many studies have examined the long-term effects of selective logging on the abundance and diversity of free-ranging primates. Logging is known to reduce the abundance of some primate species through associated hunting and the loss of food trees for frugivores; however, the potential role of pathogens in such primate population declines is largely unexplored. Selective logging results in a suite of alterations in host ecology and forest structure that may alter pathogen dynamics in resident wildlife populations. In addition, environmental pollution with human fecal material may present a risk for wildlife infections with zoonotic protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. To better understand this interplay, we compared patterns of infection with these potentially pathogenic protozoa in sympatric western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in the undisturbed Goualougo Triangle of Nouabal,-Ndoki National Park and the adjacent previously logged Kabo Concession in northern Republic of Congo. No Cryptosporidium infections were detected in any of the apes examined and prevalence of infection with Giardia was low (3.73% overall) and did not differ between logged and undisturbed forest for chimpanzees or gorillas. These results provide a baseline for prevalence of these protozoa in forest-dwelling African apes and suggest that low-intensity logging may not result in long-term elevated prevalence of potentially pathogenic protozoa.

TI Impacts of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Infection on Tadpole Foraging
   Performance
AB Pathogen-induced modifications in host behavior, including alterations in foraging behavior or foraging efficiency, can compromise host fitness by reducing growth and development. Chytridiomycosis is an infectious disease of amphibians caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and it has played an important role in the worldwide decline of amphibians. In larval anurans, Bd infections commonly result in reduced developmental rates, however, the mechanism(s) responsible are untested. We conducted laboratory experiments to test whether Bd infections reduced foraging performance of Grey Treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) and Fowler's Toad (Anaxyrus [= Bufo] fowleri) tadpoles. In the first experiment, we observed foraging behavior of Bd-infected and uninfected tadpoles to test for differences in foraging activity. In a second experiment, we tested for differences in the ingestion rates of tadpoles by examining the amount of food in their alimentary track after a 3-hour foraging period. We hypothesized that Bd-infected tadpoles would forage less often and less efficiently than uninfected tadpoles. As predicted, Bd-infected larvae forage less often and were less efficient at obtaining food than uninfected larvae. Our results show that Bd infections reduce foraging efficiency in Anaxyrus and Hyla tadpoles, and that Bd differentially affects foraging behavior in these species. Thus, our results provide a potential mechanism of decreased developmental rates of Bd-infected tadpoles.

TI Intraspecific competition between co-infecting parasite strains enhances
   host survival in African trypanosomes
AB It is becoming increasingly clear that under natural conditions parasitic infections commonly consist of co-infections with multiple conspecific strains. Multiple-strain infections lead to intraspecific interactions and may have important ecological and evolutionary effects on both hosts and parasites. However, experimental evidence on intraspecific competition or facilitation in infections has been scarce because of the technical challenges of distinguishing and tracking individual co-infecting strains. To overcome this limitation, we engineered transgenic strains of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causal agent of human African sleeping sickness. Different strains were transfected with fluorescence genes of different colors to make them visually distinguishable in order to investigate the effects of multiple-strain infections on parasite population dynamics and host fitness. We infected mice either with each strain alone or with mixes of two strains. Our results show a strong mutual competitive suppression of co-infecting T. brucei strains very early in infection. This mutual suppression changes within-host parasite dynamics and alleviates the effects of infection on the host. The strength of suppression depends on the density of the coinfecting strain, and differences in life-history traits between the strains determine the consequences of strain-strain competition for the host. Unexpectedly, co-infection with a less virulent strain significantly enhances host survival (+15%). Analysis of the strain dynamics reveals that this is due to the suppression of the density of the more virulent strain (-33%), whose degree of impact ultimately determines the physical condition of the host. The competitive suppression is likely caused by allelopathic interference or by apparent competition mediated by strain-specific immune responses. These findings highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for parasite-parasite and parasite-host interactions. To fully understand parasite and disease dynamics, the genetic diversity of infections must be taken into account. Through changes in parasite dynamics, intraspecific variation may further affect transmission dynamics and select for increased virulence of each strain. The precise mechanisms underlying mutual suppression are not yet understood but may be exploitable to fight this devastating parasite. Our results are therefore not only of basic ecological interest investigating an important form of intraspecific competition, but may also have applied relevance for public health.

TI Transmission dynamics of Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease may lead
   to disease-induced extinction
AB Most pathogens threatening to cause extinction of a host species are maintained on one or more reservoir hosts, in addition to the species that is threatened by disease. Further, most conventional host-pathogen theory assumes that transmission is related to host density, and therefore a pathogen should become extinct before its sole host. Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease is a recently emerged infectious cancer that has led to massive population declines and grave concerns for the future persistence of this largest surviving marsupial carnivore. Here we report the results of mark-recapture studies at six sites and use these data to estimate epidemiological parameters critical to both accurately assessing the risk of extinction from this disease and effectively managing this disease threat. Three sites were monitored from before or close to the time of disease arrival, and at three others disease was well established when trapping began, in one site for at least 10 years. We found no evidence for sex-specific differences in disease prevalence and little evidence of consistent seasonal variation in the force of infection. At all sites, the disease was maintained at high levels of prevalence (>50% in 2-3-year-old animals), despite causing major population declines. We also provide the first estimates of the basic reproductive rate R-0 for this disease. Using a simple age-structured deterministic model, we show that our results are not consistent with transmission being proportional to the density of infected hosts but are consistent with frequency-dependent transmission. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that local disease prevalence in 2-3-year-olds still exceeds 50% at a site where population density has been reduced by up to 90% in the past 12 years. These findings lend considerable weight to concerns that this host-specific pathogen will cause the extinction of the Tasmanian devil. Our study highlights the importance of rapidly implementing monitoring programs to determine how transmission depends on host density and emphasizes the need for ongoing management strategies involving a disease-free "insurance population,'' along with ongoing field monitoring programs to confirm whether local population extinction occurs.

TI Elasticity analysis in epidemiology: an application to tick-borne
   infections
AB The application of projection matrices in population biology to plant and animal populations has a parallel in infectious disease ecology when next-generation matrices (NGMs) are used to characterize growth in numbers of infected hosts (R-0). The NGM is appropriate for multi-host pathogens, where each matrix element represents the number of cases of one type of host arising from a single infected individual of another type. For projection matrices, calculations of the sensitivity and elasticity of the population growth rate to changes in the matrix elements has generated insight into plant and animal populations. These same perturbation analyses can be used for infectious disease systems. To illustrate this in detail we parameterized an NGM for seven tick-borne zoonoses and compared them in terms of the contributions to R-0 from three different routes of transmission between ticks, and between ticks and vertebrate hosts. The definition of host type may be the species of the host or the route of infection, or, as was the case for the set of tick-borne pathogens, a combination of species and the life stage at infection. This freedom means that there is a broad range of disease systems and questions for which the methodology is appropriate.

TI Delineating Anaplasma phagocytophilum Ecotypes in Coexisting, Discrete
   Enzootic Cycles
AB The emerging tick-borne pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum is under increasing scrutiny for the existence of subpopulations that are adapted to different natural cycles. Here, we characterized the diversity of A. phagocytophilum genotypes circulating in a natural system that includes multiple hosts and at least 2 tick species, Ixodes ricinus and the small mammal specialist I. trianguliceps. We encountered numerous genotypes, but only 1 in rodents, with the remainder limited to deer and host-seeking I. ricinus ticks. The absence of the rodent-associated genotype from host-seeking I. ricinus ticks was notable because we demonstrated that rodents fed a large proportion of the I. ricinus larval population and that these larvae were abundant when infections caused by the rodent-associated genotype were prevalent. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that genotypically distinct subpopulations of A. phagocytophilum are restricted to coexisting but separate enzootic cycles and suggest that this restriction may result from specific vector compatibility.

TI Model approaches for estimating the influence of time-varying
   socio-environmental factors on macroparasite transmission in two endemic
   regions
AB The environmental determinants of vector-and host-borne diseases include time-varying components that modify key transmission parameters, resulting in transient couplings between environmental phenomena and transmission processes. While some time-varying drivers are periodic in nature, some are aperiodic, such as those that involve episodic events or complex patterns of human behavior. Understanding these couplings can allow for prediction of periods of peak infection risk and ultimately presents opportunities for optimizing intervention selection and timing. Schistosome macroparasites of humans exhibit multiple free-living stages as well as intermediate hosts and are thus model organisms for illustrating the influence of environmental forcing on transmission. Time-varying environmental factors, termed gating functions, for schistosomes include larval response to temperature and rainfall, seasonal water contact patterns, and snail population dynamics driven by weather variables. The biological bases for these modifiers are reviewed, and their values are estimated and incorporated into a transmission model that simulates a multiyear period in two schistosomiasis endemic regions. Modeling results combined with a scale-dependent correlation analysis indicate the end effect of these site-specific gating functions is to strongly govern worm burden in these communities, in a manner particularly sensitive to the hydrological differences between sites. Two classes of gating functions were identified, those that act in concert to modify human infection (and determine worm acquisition late in the season) and those that act on snail infection (and determine early season worm acquisition). The importance of these factors for control programs and surveillance is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Exploiting strain diversity to expose transmission heterogeneities and
   predict the impact of targeting supershedding
AB When a few individuals generate disproportionately many secondary cases, targeted interventions can theoretically lead to highly efficient control of the spread of infection. Practical exploitation of heterogeneous transmission requires the sources of variability to be quantified, yet it is unusual to have empirical data of sufficient resolution to distinguish their effects. Here, we exploit extensive data on pathogen shedding densities and the distribution of cases, collected from the same population within the same spatio-temporal window, to expose the comparative epidemiology of independent Escherichia coli O157 strains. For this zoonotic pathogen, which exhibits high-density shedding (supershedding) and heterogeneous transmission in its cattle reservoir, whether targeting supershedding could be an effective control depends critically on the proposed link between shedding density and transmissibility. We substantiate this link by showing that our supershedder strain has nearly triple the R-0 of our non-supershedder strain. We show that observed transmission heterogeneities are strongly driven by superspreading in addition to supershedding, but that for the supershedder strain, the dominant strain in our study population, there remains sufficient heterogeneity in contribution to R-0 from different shedding densities to allow exploitation for control. However, in the presence of substantial within-host variability, our results indicate that rather than seek out supershedders themselves, the most effective controls would directly target the phenomenon of pathogen supershedding with the aim of interrupting or preventing high shedding densities. In this system, multiple sources of heterogeneity have masked the role of shedding densities-our potential targets for control. This analysis demonstrates the critical importance of disentangling the effects of multiple sources of heterogeneity when designing targeted interventions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Massive outbreak of viral gastroenteritis associated with consumption of
   municipal drinking water in a European capital city
AB On 24 August 2008, an outbreak alert regarding cases of acute gastroenteritis in Podgorica triggered investigations to guide control measures. From 23 August to 7 September, 1699 cases were reported in Podgorica (population 136 000) and we estimated the total size of the outbreak to be 10 000-15 000 corresponding to an attack rate of similar to 10%. We conducted an age- and neighbourhood-matched case-control study, microbiologically analysed faecal and municipal water samples and assessed the water distribution system. All cases (83/83) and 90% (89/90) of controls drank unboiled chlorinated municipal water [matched odds ratio (mOR) 11.2, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-infinity]. Consumption of bottled water was inversely associated with illness (mOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.8). Analyses of faecal samples identified six norovirus genotypes (21/38 samples) and occasionally other viruses. Multiple defects in the water distribution system were noted. These results suggest that the outbreak was caused by faecally contaminated municipal water. It is unusual to have such a large outbreak in a European city especially when the municipal water supply is chlorinated. Therefore, it is important to establish effective multiple barrier water treatment systems whenever possible, but even with an established chlorinated supply, sustained vigilance is central to public health.

TI SPECIATION DUE TO HYBRID NECROSIS IN PLANT-PATHOGEN MODELS
AB We develop a model for speciation due to postzygotic incompatibility generated by autoimmune reactions. The model is based on frequency-dependent interactions between host plants and their pathogens, which can generate disruptive selection and give rise to speciation if distant phenotypes become reproductively isolated. Based on recent experimental evidence from Arabidopsis, we assume that at the molecular level, incompatibility between host strains is caused by epistatic interactions between two proteins in the plant immune system-the guard and the guardee. Within each plant strain, immune reactions occur when the guardee protein is modified by a pathogen effector, and the guard subsequently binds to the guardee, thus precipitating an immune response. When guard and guardee proteins come from phenotypically distant parents, a hybrid's immune system can be triggered by erroneous interactions between these proteins even in the absence of pathogen attack, leading to severe autoimmune reactions in hybrids. This generates a Dobzhnasky-Muller incompatibility due to immune reactions. Our model shows how phenotypic variation generated by frequency-dependent host-pathogen interactions can lead to such postzygotic incompatibilities between extremal types, and hence to speciation.

TI Eight years of entomological surveillance in Italy show no evidence of
   Culicoides imicola geographical range expansion
AB P>1. Assessing changes in species range is based on identifying new occurrences in areas where absence has been inferred due to lack of previous records. This technique depends on creating a consistent observational dataset, based on comparable detection methods.
   2. In Mediterranean countries, the midge Culicoides imicola is the principal vector of bluetongue virus (BTV) that causes an infectious disease of domestic and wild ruminants. Over the last 10 years, BTV has invaded Mediterranean countries (1998) and much of Northern Europe (2006); this unprecedented spread is reported to be a possible consequence of climate change. In southern Europe, based on recent observations found in northern latitudes, BTV spread has been attributed in part to changes in C. imicola distribution. However, current sampling of Culicoides spp. is far more intensive and targeted than that undertaken before the first BTV epidemics; this obviously results in new information from areas in which collections would have had little chance of positive identification in the past.
   3. Since 2001, a national surveillance programme based on permanent traps was established in Italy to follow C. imicola population dynamics in space and time. Based on data from 2000 to 2001 cross-sectional studies, Italy was divided into three zones (I: endemicity; II: transition; III: absence) in which longitudinal data on C. imicola presence and abundance were analysed as a function of time between 2002 and 2007 through linear and quantile regressions.
   4. The results from the surveillance programme demonstrate no detectable range expansion of the C. imicola population in Italy between 2002 and 2007.
   5.Synthesis and applications. This study provides strong evidence that there has been no measurable range expansion between 2002 and 2007 in a species previously described as moving northwards as a result of climate change. For any reliable conclusions to be drawn on the range distribution of C. imicola or other similar vector species in Southern Europe, the Culicoides surveillance system across all European countries should be designed to provide comparable data based on a constant detection probability over time.

TI Genetic diversity, population structure and sex-biased dispersal in
   three co-evolving species
AB Genetic diversity and spatial structure of populations are important for antagonistic coevolution. We investigated genetic variation and population structure of three closely related European ant species: the social parasite Harpagoxenus sublaevis and its two host species Leptothorax acervorum and Leptothorax muscorum. We sampled populations in 12 countries and analysed eight microsatellite loci and an mtDNA sequence. We found high levels of genetic variation in all three species, only slightly less variation in the host L. muscorum. Using a newly introduced measure of differentiation (Jost's D-est), we detected strong population structuring in all species and less male-biased dispersal than previously thought. We found no phylogeographic patterns that could give information on post-glacial colonization routes - northern populations are as variable as more southern populations. We conclude that conditions for Thompson's geographic mosaic of coevolution are ideal in this system: all three species show ample genetic variation and strong population structure.

TI Yearly influenza vaccinations: a double-edged sword?
AB Yearly vaccination against seasonal influenza viruses is recommended for certain individuals at high risk of complications associated with influenza. It has been recommended in some countries, including the USA, that all children aged 6-59 months are vaccinated against seasonal influenza. However, it has been shown-mainly in animals-that infection with influenza A viruses can induce protective immunity to influenza A viruses of other unrelated subtypes. This so-called heterosubtypic immunity does not provide full protection, but can limit virus replication and reduce morbidity and mortality of the host. This type of immunity might be relevant to human beings when a new subtype of influenza A virus is introduced into the population, such as the new influenza A H1N1 virus responsible for the present influenza pandemic and the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses that are causing an ever increasing number of human infections with high mortality rates. Preventing infection with seasonal influenza viruses by vaccination might prevent the induction of heterosubtypic immunity to pandemic strains, which might be a disadvantage to immunologically naive people-eg, infants.

TI Amphibian chytridiomycosis in Japan: distribution, haplotypes and
   possible route of entry into Japan
AB A serious disease of amphibians caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was first found in Japan in December 2006 in imported pet frogs. This was the first report of chytridiomycosis in Asia. To assess the risk of pandemic chytridiomycosis to Japanese frogs, we surveyed the distribution of the fungus among captive and wild frog populations. We established a nested PCR assay that uses two pairs of PCR primers to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of a ribosomal RNA cassette to detect mild fungal infections from as little as 0.001 pg (1 fg) of B. dendrobatidis DNA. We collected swab samples from 265 amphibians sold at pet shops, 294 bred at institutes and 2103 collected at field sites from northern to southwestern Japan. We detected infections in native and exotic species, both in captivity and in the field. Sequencing of PCR products revealed 26 haplotypes of the B. dendrobatidis ITS region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three of these haplotypes were specific to the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) and appeared to have established a commensal relationship with this native amphibian. Many other haplotypes were carried by alien amphibians. The highest genetic diversity of B. dendrobatidis was found in the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana). Some strains of B. dendrobatidis appeared to be endemic to Japanese native amphibians, but many alien strains are being introduced into Japan via imported amphibians. To improve chytridiomycosis risk management, we must consider the risk of B. dendrobatidis changing hosts as a result of anthropogenic disturbance of the host-specific distribution of the fungus.

TI Human Probing Behavior of Aedes aegypti when Infected with a
   Life-Shortening Strain of Wolbachia
AB Background: Mosquitoes are vectors of many serious pathogens in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Current control strategies almost entirely rely upon insecticides, which increasingly face the problems of high cost, increasing mosquito resistance and negative effects on non-target organisms. Alternative strategies include the proposed use of inherited life-shortening agents, such as the Wolbachia bacterium. By shortening mosquito vector lifespan, Wolbachia could potentially reduce the vectorial capacity of mosquito populations. We have recently been able to stably transinfect Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the life-shortening Wolbachia strain wMelPop, and are assessing various aspects of its interaction with the mosquito host to determine its likely impact on pathogen transmission as well as its potential ability to invade A. aegypti populations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we have examined the probing behavior of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in an attempt to understand both the broader impact of Wolbachia infection on mosquito biology and, in particular, vectorial capacity. The probing behavior of wMelPop-infected mosquitoes at four adult ages was examined and compared to uninfected controls during video-recorded feeding trials on a human hand. Wolbachia-positive insects, from 15 days of age, showed a drastic increase in the time spent pre-probing and probing relative to uninfected controls. Two other important features for blood feeding, saliva volume and apyrase content of saliva, were also studied.
   Conclusions/Significance: As A. aegypti infected with wMelPop age, they show increasing difficulty in completing the process of blood feeding effectively and efficiently. Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes on average produced smaller volumes of saliva that still contained the same amount of apyrase activity as uninfected mosquitoes. These effects on blood feeding behavior may reduce vectorial capacity and point to underlying physiological changes in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

TI Genetic Variation Associated with Mammalian Feeding in Culex pipiens
   from a West Nile Virus Epidemic Region in Chicago, Illinois
AB Mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex are important vectors of West Nile virus in the United States. We examined the genetic variations of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from Chicago, Illinois that were determined to be principally ornithophilic but exhibited a relatively higher inclination for mammalian hosts including humans. Microsatellite analysis of 10 polymorphic markers was performed on 346 engorged Cx. pipiens specimens with identified avian or mammalian blood meals. Our results indicated that there were no significant differences in allelic richness, the pattern of conformity to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium, nor was there overall genetic differentiation between specimens with avian-and mammalian-derived blood meals. However, Cx. pipiens form pipiens with mammalian- (including human-) derived blood meals had significantly higher ancestry (p < 0.001) and proportion of hybrids (p < 0.01) from the Cx. pipiens form molestus (population from New York City) than did those with avian-derived blood meals. By contrast, there were no significant differences in the ancestry (p > 0.05) and the proportion of hybrids (p > 0.05) from Cx. quinquefasciatus (population from Harris Country, Texas). No temporal genetic variation was detected in accordance with the observation that there was no shift in blood feeding from birds to mammals. The results of this study in conjunction with regional host-feeding behavior suggest that the probability of genetic ancestry from Cx. pipiens f. molestus may predispose mosquitoes to feed more readily on mammals; however, the genetic mechanisms are unknown.

TI Human Ebola Outbreak Resulting from Direct Exposure to Fruit Bats in
   Luebo, Democratic Republic of Congo, 2007
AB Twelve years after the Kikwit Ebola outbreak in 1995, Ebola virus reemerged in the Occidental Kasai province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) between May and November 2007, affecting more than 260 humans and causing 186 deaths. During this latter outbreak we conducted several epidemiological investigations to identify the underlying ecological conditions and animal sources. Qualitative social and environmental data were collected through interviews with villagers and by direct observation. The local populations reported no unusual morbidity or mortality among wild or domestic animals, but they described a massive annual fruit bat migration toward the southeast, up the Lulua River. Migrating bats settled in the outbreak area for several weeks, between April and May, nestling in the numerous fruit trees in Ndongo and Koumelele islands as well as in palm trees of a largely abandoned plantation. They were massively hunted by villagers, for whom they represented a major source of protein. By tracing back the initial human-human transmission events, we were able to show that, in May, the putative first human victim bought freshly killed bats from hunters to eat. We were able to reconstruct the likely initial human-human transmission events that preceded the outbreak. This study provides the most likely sequence of events linking a human Ebola outbreak to exposure to fruit bats, a putative virus reservoir. These findings support the suspected role of bats in the natural cycle of Ebola virus and indicate that the massive seasonal fruit bat migrations should be taken into account in operational Ebola risk maps and seasonal alerts in the DRC.

TI Variation and covariation in infectivity, virulence and immunodepression
   in the host-parasite association Gammarus pulex-Pomphorhynchus laevis
AB Parasites often manipulate host immunity for their own benefit, either by exacerbating or suppressing the immune response and this may directly affect the expression of parasite virulence. However, genetic variation in immunodepression, which is a prerequisite to its evolution, and the relationship between immunodepression and virulence, have rarely been studied. Here, we investigated the variation among sibships of the acanthocephalan parasite, Pomphorhynchus laevis, in infecting and in immunodepressing its amphipod host, Gammarus pulex. We also assessed the covariation between infectivity, parasite-induced immune depression and host mortality (parasite virulence). We found that infectivity, the intensity of immunodepression and virulence were variable among parasite sibships. Infectivity and the level of immunodepression were not correlated across parasite sibships. Whereas infectivity was unrelated to host mortality, we found that gammarids that were exposed to the parasite sibships that immunodepressed their hosts the most survived better. This positive covariation between host survival and immunodepression suggests that gammarids exposed to the less immunodepressive parasites could suffer from damage imposed by a higher activity of the phenoloxidase.

TI Invited Commentary: Evaluating Vaccination Programs Using Genetic
   Sequence Data
AB Genomic data will become an increasingly important component of epidemiologic studies in coming years. The authors of the accompanying Journal article, van Ballegooijen et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2009;170(12):1455-1463), are to be commended for attempting to use the coalescent analysis of viral sequence data to evaluate a hepatitis B vaccination program. Coalescent theory attempts to link the phylogenetic history of populations with rates of population growth and decline. In particular, under certain assumptions, a reduction in genetic diversity can be interpreted as a reduction in disease incidence. However, the authors of this commentary contend that van Ballegooijen et al.'s interpretation of changes in viral genetic diversity as a measure of hepatitis B vaccine effectiveness has major limitations. Because of the potential use of these methods in future vaccination studies, the authors discuss the utility of these methods and the data requirements needed for them to be convincing. First, data sets should be large enough to provide sufficient epidemiologic-scale resolution. Second, data need to reflect sufficiently fine-grained temporal sampling. Third, other processes that can potentially influence genetic diversity and confuse demographic inferences should be considered.

TI Cost-Effectiveness of Adult Circumcision in a Resource-Rich Setting for
   HIV Prevention among Men Who Have Sex with Men
AB Background. We examined the effects and cost-effectiveness of 4 strategies of circumcision in a resource-rich setting (Australia) in a population of men who have sex with men (MSM).
   Method. We created a dynamic mathematical transmission model and performed an economic analysis to estimate the costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of different strategies, compared with those of the status quo. Strategies included circumcision of all MSM at age 18 years, circumcision of all MSM aged 35-44 years, circumcision of all insertive MSM aged >= 18 years, and circumcision of all MSM aged >= 18 years. All costs are reported in US dollars, with a cost-effectiveness threshold of $42,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.
   Results. We find that 2%-5% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections would be averted per year, with initial costs ranging from $3.6 million to $95.1 million, depending on the strategy. The number of circumcisions needed to prevent 1 HIV infection would range from 118 through 338. Circumcision of predominately insertive MSM would save $21.7 million over 25 years with a $62.2 million investment. Strategies to circumcise 100% of all MSM and to circumcise MSM aged 35-44 years would be cost-effective; the latter would require a smaller investment. The least cost-effective approach is circumcision of young MSM close to their sexual debut. Results are very sensitive to assumptions about the cost of circumcision, the efficacy of circumcision, sexual preferences, and behavioral disinhibition.
   Conclusions. Circumcision of adult MSM may be cost-effective in this resource-rich setting. However, the intervention costs are high relative to the costs spent on other HIV prevention programs.

TI Pathogen Dose Infectivity Curves as a Method to Analyze the Distribution
   of Host Susceptibility: A Quantitative Assessment of Maternal Effects
   after Food Stress and Pathogen Exposure
AB Stress conditions have been found to change the susceptibility of hosts or their offspring to infection. The usual method of testing at just one parasite dose level does not allow conclusions on the distribution of susceptibility. To better understand the epidemiology and evolution of host-parasite systems, however, knowledge about the distribution of host susceptibility, the parameters that characterize it, and how it changes in response to environmental conditions is required. We investigated transgenerational effects of different stress factors by exposing Daphnia magna to standard conditions, to low food levels, or to a high dose of the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa and then measuring the susceptibility of the offspring to different spore doses of the parasite. For the analysis we used a mathematical model that predicts the fraction of infected hosts at different parasite doses, allowing us to estimate the mean and variance of host susceptibility. We find that low food levels reduce both the mean and the variance of offspring susceptibility. Parasite exposure, on the other hand, widens the offspring's susceptibility distribution without affecting its mean. Our analysis uncovered previously unknown transgenerational effects on the distribution of susceptibilities. The finding of an alteration in the variance of susceptibility to infection has implications for host and parasite dynamics and can contribute to our understanding of the stability of host-parasite interactions.

TI Bats Without Borders: Long-Distance Movements and Implications for
   Disease Risk Management
AB Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural hosts of several recently emerged zoonotic viruses of animal and human health significance in Australia and Asia, including Hendra and Nipah viruses. Satellite telemetry was used on nine flying-foxes of three species (Pteropus alecto n = 5, P. vampyrus n = 2, and P. neohibernicus n = 2) to determine the scale and pattern of their long-distance movements and their potential to transfer these viruses between countries in the region. The animals were captured and released from six different locations in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste. Their movements were recorded for a median of 120 (range, 47-342) days with a median total distance travelled of 393 (range, 76-3011) km per individual. Pteropus alecto individuals were observed to move between Australia and Papua New Guinea (Western Province) on four occasions, between Papua New Guinea (Western Province) and Indonesia (Papua) on ten occasions, and to traverse Torres Strait on two occasions. Pteropus vampyrus was observed to move between Timor-Leste and Indonesia (West Timor) on one occasion. These findings expand upon the current literature on the potential for transfer of zoonotic viruses by flying-foxes between countries and have implications for disease risk management and for the conservation management of flying-fox populations in Australia, New Guinea, and the Lesser Sunda Islands.

TI Persistence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 Virus Defined by
   Agro-Ecological Niche
AB The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has spread across Eurasia and into Africa. Its persistence in a number of countries continues to disrupt poultry production, impairs smallholder livelihoods, and raises the risk a genotype adapted to human-to-human transmission may emerge. While previous studies identified domestic duck reservoirs as a primary risk factor associated with HPAI H5N1 persistence in poultry in Southeast Asia, little is known of such factors in countries with different agro-ecological conditions, and no study has investigated the impact of such conditions on HPAI H5N1 epidemiology at the global scale. This study explores the patterns of HPAI H5N1 persistence worldwide, and for China, Indonesia, and India includes individual provinces that have reported HPAI H5N1 presence during the 2004-2008 period. Multivariate analysis of a set of 14 agricultural, environmental, climatic, and socio-economic factors demonstrates in quantitative terms that a combination of six variables discriminates the areas with human cases and persistence: agricultural population density, duck density, duck by chicken density, chicken density, the product of agricultural population density and chicken output/input ratio, and purchasing power per capita. The analysis identifies five agro-ecological clusters, or niches, representing varying degrees of disease persistence. The agro-ecological distances of all study areas to the medoid of the niche with the greatest number of human cases are used to map HPAI H5N1 risk globally. The results indicate that few countries remain where HPAI H5N1 would likely persist should it be introduced.

TI Pathogen Host Switching in Commercial Trade with Management
   Recommendations
AB Global wildlife trade exacerbates the spread of nonindigenous species. Pathogens also move with hosts through trade and often are released into naive populations with unpredictable outcomes. Amphibians are moved commercially for pets, food, bait, and biomedicine, and are an excellent model for studying how wildlife trade relates to pathogen pollution. Ranaviruses are amphibian pathogens associated with annual population die-offs; multiple strains of tiger salamander ranaviruses move through the bait trade in the western United States. Ranaviruses infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish and are of additional concern because they can switch hosts. Tiger salamanders are used as live bait for freshwater fishing and are a potential source for ranaviruses switching hosts from amphibians to fish. We experimentally injected largemouth bass with a bait trade tiger salamander ranavirus. Largemouth bass became infected but exhibited no signs of disease or mortality. Amphibian bait ranaviruses have the potential to switch hosts to infect fish, but fish may act as dead-end hosts or nonsymptomatic carriers, potentially spreading infection as a result of trade.

TI Parasite virulence, host life history, and the costs and benefits of sex
AB The widespread existence of sexual reproduction is widely considered to be one of the most pressing anomalies for evolutionary theory. One possible solution is that coevolution between hosts and parasites might favor sexual over asexual reproduction (the Red Queen hypothesis), provided infection is genotype specific and highly Virulent. This requirement for high virulence has been seen as a limitation of the theory. In the present study, I solve for the cost of sex per reproductive time step of the host, as well as the minimum Virulence required to select for sex. The results show that the cost of sex per time step increases with increases in the host's mortality rate, reaching twofold in annual host species. The results also show that high virulence is not required to select for sexual reproduction, especially in long-lived organisms. These findings might help to explain the Paucity of parthenogenesis in organisms having long generation times.

TI Density-dependent prophylactic immunity reconsidered in the light of
   host group living and social behavior
AB According to the density-dependent hypothesis (DIDP), hosts living at high densities suffer greater risk of disease and so invest more in immunity. Although there is much empirical support For this, especially from invertebrate systems, there are many exceptions, notably in social insects. We propose that (A) density is not always the most appropriate population parameter to Use when considering the risks associated with disease and (13) behavioral defenses should be given a greater emphasis in considerations of a host's repertoire of immune defenses. We propose la complementary framework stressing the connectivity between and within populations as a starting point and emphasizing the costs represented by disease above the risk of disease per se. We consider the components of immune defense and propose that behaviors may represent lower-cost defenses than their physiological counterparts. As group-living and particularly social animals will have a greater behavioral repertoire, We conclude that with group living comes a greater capacity for behavioral immune defense, Most particularly for Social insects. This may escape our notice if we consider physiological parameters alone.

TI Environmental and ecological potential for enzootic cycles of Puumala
   hantavirus in Great Britain
AB Puumala virus (PUUV) is a zoonotic rodent-borne hantavirus in continental Europe. Its reservoir host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), is ubiquitous in Great Britain (GB); however, there has been no reported incidence of virus in either animals or humans. In northwest Europe, increases in bank vole numbers, Stimulated by increases in production of beech/oak crops (mast), are associated with outbreaks of nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans. These so-called 'mast years' are determined by sequential climatic events. This paper investigates the contribution of a number of ecological and environmental factors driving Outbreaks of PUUV in northwest Europe and assesses whether such factors might also permit enzootic PUUV circulation in GB. Analysis of GB climate data, using regression models, confirms that mast years in GB are stimulated, and can be predicted, by the same climatic events Is mast years in PUUV-endemic regions of northwest Europe. A number of other possible non-climatic constraints on enzootic cycles Lire discussed.

TI CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY IN POPULATIONS WITH OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS
AB Many insects and other arthropods harbor maternally inherited bacteria inducing "cytoplasmic incompatibility" (CI), reduced egg hatch when infected males mate with uninfected females. CI-causing infections produce a frequency-dependent reproductive advantage for infected females. However, many such infections impose fitness costs that lead to unstable equilibrium frequencies below which the infections tend to be eliminated. To understand the unstable equilibria produced by reduced lifespan or lengthened development, overlapping-generation analyses are needed. An idealized model of overlapping generations with age-independent parameters produces a simple expression showing how the unstable point depends on the population growth rate, the intensity of CI, and the infection's effects on development time, longevity, and fecundity. The interpretation of this equilibrium is complicated by age structure. Nevertheless, the unstable equilibrium provides insight into the CI-causing infections found in nature, and it can guide potential manipulations of natural populations, including those that transmit diseases, through the introduction of infections that alter life-table parameters.

We investigated the patterns and causes of variation in phenological synchrony in the oak-powdery mildew pathosystem, a major disease in natural ecosystems. The study was carried out along an altitudinal gradient, representing a wide temperature range, in mature oak stands. Both sporulation (pathogen infective stage) and oak flushing (host susceptible stage) were delayed with increasing elevation, but with a significantly different sensitivity for the two species. This resulted in a variable host-pathogen synchrony along the gradient. A common garden experiment did not give evidence of among-population genetic differentiation (past adaptation) for fungal phenology. This could be explained by the high phenotypic variation in phenology within host populations, precluding selection on fungal phenology at the population scale, but possibly favouring adaptation at the within-population scale. Phenotypic plasticity was the major cause of the observed variation in the phenology of the fungal populations.

TI Antagonistic coevolution across productivity gradients: an experimental
   test of the effects of dispersal
AB Coevolution commonly occurs in spatially heterogeneous environments, resulting in variable selection pressures acting on coevolving species. Dispersal across such environments is predicted to have a major impact on local coevolutionary dynamics. Here, we address how co-dispersal of coevolving populations of host and parasite across an environmental productivity gradient affected coevolution in experimental populations of bacteria and their parasitic viruses (phages). The rate of coevolution between bacteria and phages was greater in high-productivity environments. High-productivity immigrants (similar to 2% of the recipient population) caused coevolutionary dynamics (rates of coevolution and degree of generalist evolution) in low-productivity environments to be largely indistinguishable from high-productivity environments, whereas immigration from low-productivity environments (similar to 0.5% of the population) had no discernable impact. These results could not be explained by demography alone, but rather high-productivity immigrants had a selective advantage in low-productivity environments, but not vice versa. Coevolutionary interactions in high-productivity environments are therefore likely to have a disproportionate impact on coevolution across the landscape as a whole.

TI Rapid spread of male-killing Wolbachia in the butterfly Hypolimnas
   bolina
AB Reproductive parasites such as Wolbachia can spread through uninfected host populations by increasing the relative fitness of the infected maternal lineage. However, empirical estimates of how fast this process occurs are limited. Here we use nucleotide sequences of male-killing Wolbachia bacteria and co-inherited mitochondria to address this issue in the island butterfly Hypolimnas bolina. We show that infected specimens scattered throughout the species range harbour the same Wolbachia and mitochondrial DNA as inferred from 6337 bp of the bacterial genome and 2985 bp of the mitochondrial genome, suggesting this strain of Wolbachia has spread across the South Pacific Islands at most 3000 years ago, and probably much more recently.

TI Trends in Patterns of Dengue Transmission over 4 Years in a Pediatric
   Cohort Study in Nicaragua
AB Background. Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans and a major urban public health problem worldwide.
   Methods. A prospective cohort study of similar to 3800 children initially aged 2-9 years was established in Managua, Nicaragua, in 2004 to study the natural history of dengue transmission in an urban pediatric population. Blood samples from healthy subjects were collected annually prior to the dengue season, and identification of dengue cases occurred via enhanced passive surveillance at the study health center.
   Results. Over the first four years of the study, seroprevalence of anti-dengue virus (DENV) antibodies increased from 22%-40% in the 2-year-old cohort and 90%-95% in the 9-year-old cohort. The incidence of symptomatic dengue cases and the ratio of inapparent to symptomatic DENV infection varied substantially from year to year. The switch in dominant transmission from DENV-1 to DENV-2 was accompanied by an increase in disease severity but, paradoxically, a decrease in transmission. Phylogeographic analysis of full-length DENV-2 sequences revealed strong geographic clustering of dengue cases.
   Conclusions. This large-scale cohort study of dengue in the Americas demonstrates year-to-year variation of dengue within a pediatric population, revealing expected patterns in transmission while highlighting the impact of interventions, climate, and viral evolution.

TI Host immunity as a determinant of treatment outcome in Plasmodium
   falciparum malaria
AB Host immunity is an important but poorly understood determinant of antimalarial efficacy, influencing the outcome of prevention and treatment trials. Variations in host immunity might explain why factors such as host genetics, age, pregnancy, infection with HIV, parasite density and malaria transmission intensity, can raise or lower apparent cure rates. Recently, attempts have been made to characterise immunological correlates of treatment outcome in Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but not yet for Plasmodium vivax. A better understanding of such correlates might improve trials of antimalarial drugs and provide leads for vaccine development. Greater understanding of the relation between host immunity and treatment outcome is crucial to making informed choices about the use of safe but partly effective drugs for malaria prevention in children and pregnant women. With increasing malaria control efforts worldwide, declining population immunity might alter drug response profiles. Improved methods for assessing antimalarial immunity will strengthen malaria control efforts.

TI Relatedness of Macrophomina phaseolina isolates from tallgrass prairie,
   maize, soybean and sorghum
AB Agricultural and wild ecosystems may interact through shared pathogens such as Macrophomina phaseolina, a generalist clonal fungus with more than 284 plant hosts that is likely to become more important under climate change scenarios of increased heat and drought stress. To evaluate the degree of subdivision in populations of M. phaseolina in Kansas agriculture and wildlands, we compared 143 isolates from maize fields adjacent to tallgrass prairie, nearby sorghum fields, widely dispersed soybean fields and isolates from eight plant species in tallgrass prairie. Isolate growth phenotypes were evaluated on a medium containing chlorate. Genetic characteristics were analysed based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms and the sequence of the rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The average genetic similarity was 58% among isolates in the tallgrass prairie, 71% in the maize fields, 75% in the sorghum fields and 80% in the dispersed soybean fields. The isolates were divided into four clusters: one containing most of the isolates from maize and soybean, two others containing isolates from wild plants and sorghum, and a fourth containing a single isolate recovered from Solidago canadensis in the tallgrass prairie. Most of the sorghum isolates had the dense phenotype on media containing chlorate, while those from other hosts had either feathery or restricted phenotypes. These results suggest that the tallgrass prairie supports a more diverse population of M. phaseolina per area than do any of the crop species. Subpopulations show incomplete specialization by host. These results also suggest that inoculum produced in agriculture may influence tallgrass prairie communities, and conversely that different pathogen subpopulations in tallgrass prairie can interact there to generate 'hybrids' with novel genetic profiles and pathogenic capabilities.

TI Low genetic diversity in a snail intermediate host (Biomphalaria
   pfeifferi Krass, 1848) and schistosomiasis transmission in the Senegal
   River Basin
AB Population genetic perturbations of intermediate hosts, often a consequence of human pressure on environmental resources, can precipitate unexpectedly severe disease outbreaks. Such disturbances are set to become increasingly common following range changes concomitant with climate shifts, dwindling natural resources and major infrastructure changes such as hydroprojects. Construction of the Diama dam in the Senegal River Basin (SRB) reduced river salinity, enabling the freshwater snail intermediate host Biomphalaria pfeifferi to rapidly expand its distribution. A serious public health problem ensued, with an epidemic of intestinal schistosomiasis occurring in the previously schistosome-free Richard-Toll region within 2 years. The current study aimed to assess the population variability of B. pfeifferi in the SRB, and speculate upon its subsequent impact on host-parasite interactions following such engineered ecological change. Genetic variation at nine polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed little population differentiation in SRB snails compared with those from natural habitats in Zimbabwe, where Schistosoma mansoni transmission is much lower. 'Open' SRB habitats are associated with greater water contact, smaller population sizes and less genetic diversity, with sites downstream of Richard-Toll showing greater inter- and intrapopulation variation, concomitant with less frequent human contact. These observations may be explained by rapid expansion into pristine habitat selecting for high fecundity genotypes at the expense of schistosome resistance, presenting S. mansoni with genetically homogenous highly fecund susceptible populations around the focal point, promoting development of a highly compatible host-parasite relationship. Longitudinal study of such systems may prove important in predicting public health risks engendered by future environmental engineering projects.

TI Genetic isolation among sympatric vegetative compatibility groups of the
   aflatoxin-producing fungus Aspergillus flavus
AB Aspergillus flavus, a fungal pathogen of animals and both wild and economically important plants, is most recognized for producing aflatoxin, a cancer-causing secondary metabolite that contaminates food and animal feed globally. Aspergillus flavus has two self/nonself recognition systems, a sexual compatibility system and a vegetative incompatibility system, and both play a role in directing gene flow in populations. Aspergillus flavus reproduces clonally in wild and agricultural settings, but whether a cryptic sexual stage exists in nature is currently unknown. We investigated the distribution of genetic variation in 243 samples collected over 4 years from three common vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) in Arizona and Texas from cotton using 24 microsatellite loci and the mating type locus (MAT) to assess population structure and potential gene flow among A. flavus VCGs in sympatric populations. All isolates within a VCG had the same mating type with OD02 having MAT1-2 and both CG136 and MR17 having MAT1-1. Our results support the hypothesis that these three A. flavus VCGs are genetically isolated. We found high levels of genetic differentiation and no evidence of gene flow between VCGs, including VCGs of opposite mating-type. Our results suggest that these VCGs diverged before domestication of agricultural hosts (> 10 000 yr bp).

TI FluTE, a Publicly Available Stochastic Influenza Epidemic Simulation
   Model
AB Mathematical and computer models of epidemics have contributed to our understanding of the spread of infectious disease and the measures needed to contain or mitigate them. To help prepare for future influenza seasonal epidemics or pandemics, we developed a new stochastic model of the spread of influenza across a large population. Individuals in this model have realistic social contact networks, and transmission and infections are based on the current state of knowledge of the natural history of influenza. The model has been calibrated so that outcomes are consistent with the 1957/1958 Asian A(H2N2) and 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) influenza viruses. We present examples of how this model can be used to study the dynamics of influenza epidemics in the United States and simulate how to mitigate or delay them using pharmaceutical interventions and social distancing measures. Computer simulation models play an essential role in informing public policy and evaluating pandemic preparedness plans. We have made the source code of this model publicly available to encourage its use and further development.

TI Recombination Rate and Selection Strength in HIV Intra-patient Evolution
AB The evolutionary dynamics of HIV during the chronic phase of infection is driven by the host immune response and by selective pressures exerted through drug treatment. To understand and model the evolution of HIV quantitatively, the parameters governing genetic diversification and the strength of selection need to be known. While mutation rates can be measured in single replication cycles, the relevant effective recombination rate depends on the probability of coinfection of a cell with more than one virus and can only be inferred from population data. However, most population genetic estimators for recombination rates assume absence of selection and are hence of limited applicability to HIV, since positive and purifying selection are important in HIV evolution. Yet, little is known about the distribution of selection differentials between individual viruses and the impact of single polymorphisms on viral fitness. Here, we estimate the rate of recombination and the distribution of selection coefficients from time series sequence data tracking the evolution of HIV within single patients. By examining temporal changes in the genetic composition of the population, we estimate the effective recombination to be rho = 1.4 +/- 0.6x10(-5) recombinations per site and generation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the selection coefficients of at least 15% of the observed non-synonymous polymorphisms exceed 0.8% per generation. These results provide a basis for a more detailed understanding of the evolution of HIV. A particularly interesting case is evolution in response to drug treatment, where recombination can facilitate the rapid acquisition of multiple resistance mutations. With the methods developed here, more precise and more detailed studies will be possible as soon as data with higher time resolution and greater sample sizes are available.

TI Disentangling the Effect of Local and Global Spatial Variation on a
   Mosquito-Borne Infection in a Neotropical Heterogeneous Environment
AB Mosquito-borne pathogen transmission exhibits spatial-temporal variability caused by ecological interactions acting at different scales. We used local spatial statistics and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to determine the spatial pattern of malaria incidence and persistence in northeastern Venezuela. Seven to 11 hot spots of malaria transmission were detected by Using local spatial statistics, although disease persistence was explained only for four Of those hot spots. The GWR models greatly improved predictions of malaria risk compared with ordinary least squares, (OLS) regression models. Malaria incidence vas largely explained by the proximity to and number of Anopheles aquasalis habitats nearby (1-3 km). and low-elevation terrains. Disease persistence was associated with greater human population density, lower elevations, and proximity to aquatic habitats. However. there was significant local spatial variation in the relationship between malaria and environmental variables. Spatial modeling improves the understanding of the causal factors operating at several scales in the transmission of malaria.

TI Transmission Potential of Two Chimeric Western Equine Encephalitis
   Vaccine Candidates in Culex tarsalis
AB Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) is a zoonotic alphavirus that circulates in western North America between passerine birds and mosquitoes, primarily Culex tarsalis. Since it was isolated in 1930, WEEV has caused tells of thousands of equine deaths in addition to thousands Of human cases. In addition because WEEV is a virus of agricultural importance in addition to a Public health threat, we developed two live-attenuated chimeric vaccine candidates that have been shown to be immunogenic and efficacious in mouse models. Vaccine candidate strains were developed by inserting the structural protein genes of WEEV strain McMillan (McM) or CO92-1356 into a Sindbis virus (SINV) strain AR339 backbone. The SIN/McM chimera also derived the N-terminal half Of its capsid gene from a North American eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) strain FL39-939 (henceforth referred to as SIN/EEE/McM). Although these vaccines do not generate viremia in mice, We further assessed their safety by exposing Cx. tarsalis to artificial blood meals containing high viral titers of each vaccine candidate. Both viruses exhibited a decreased rate of infection. dissemination, and transmission potential compared with the parental alphaviruses. Specifically., SIN/CO92 infected 37% Of mosquitoes and disseminated in but failed to reach the saliva of the mosquitoes. In contrast, the SIN/EEE/McM virus was unable to infect, disseminate, or be transmitted in the saliva of any mosquitoes. These findings Suggest that both vaccine candidates are less competent than the parental strains to be transmitted by the primary mosquito Vector, Cx. tarsalis, and are Unlikely to be reintroduced into a natural WEEV transmission cycle.

TI Apparent competition in canopy trees determined by pathogen transmission
   rather than susceptibility
AB Epidemiological theory predicts that asymmetric transmission, Susceptibility, and mortality within a community will drive pathogen and disease dynamics. These epidemiological asymmetries call result in apparent competition, where a highly infectious host reduces the abundance of less infectious or more susceptible members in a community via a shared pathogen. We show that the exotic pathogen Phytophthora ramorum and resulting disease, Sudden oak death, cause apparent competition among canopy trees and that transmission differences among canopy trees drives patterns of disease severity in California coast redwood forests. P. ramorum ranges in its ability to infect, sporulate on, and cause mortality of infected hosts. A path analysis showed that the most prolific inoculum producer, California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), had I greater impact on the mortality rate of tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) than did other inoculum-supporting species. In stands experiencing high tanoak mortality, lack of negative impacts by P. ramorum oil bay laurel may increase bay laurel density and subsequently result in positive feedback oil pathogen Populations. This study demonstrates the degree to which invasive, generalist pathogens call cause rapid changes in forest canopy composition and that differences in transmission call be more important than Susceptibility in driving patterns of apparent competition.

TI Extraordinarily widespread and fantastically complex: comparative
   biology of endosymbiotic bacterial and fungal mutualists of insects
AB Endosymbiosis is a pervasive, powerful force in arthropod evolution. In the recent literature, bacterial symbionts of insects have been shown to function as reproductive manipulators, nutritional mutualists and as defenders of their hosts. Fungi, like bacteria, are also frequently associated with insects. Initial estimates suggest that insect-fungal endosymbionts are hyperdiverse, yet there has been comparatively little research investigating the roles that fungi play in their insect hosts. In many systems in which the bacterial symbionts are well-characterized, the possible presence of fungi has been routinely ignored. Why has there been so little research on this important group of symbionts? Here, we explore the differences between fungal and bacterial endosymbiotic insect mutualists. We make predictions about why a bacterium or fungus might be found associated with an insect host given particular ecological, physiological, or evolutionary conditions. We also touch on the various hurdles for studying fungal vs. bacterial endosymbionts and potential future research directions.

TI Effects of Coronavirus Infections in Children
AB The isolation of the coronavirus (CoV) identified as the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the detection of 2 new human CoVs (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) have led to studies of the epidemiology and clinical and socioeconomic effects of infections caused by all HCoVs, including those known since the late 1960s (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43). HCoV infections can be associated with respiratory and extra respiratory manifestations, including central nervous system involvement. Furthermore, unlike other RNA viruses, HCoVs can easily mutate and recombine when different strains infect the same cells and give rise to a novel virus with unpredictable host ranges and pathogenicity. Thus, circulating HCoVs should be closely monitored to detect the spread of particularly virulent strains in the community at an early stage and to facilitate the development of adequate preventive and therapeutic measures.

TI Transmission routes and risk factors for autochthonous hepatitis E virus
   infection in Europe: a systematic review
AB Increasing numbers of non-travel-associated hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections have been reported in Europe in recent years. Our objective was to review the evidence on risk factors and transmission routes of autochthonous HEV infection and hepatitis E in Europe in order to develop recommendations for future research, prevention and control. A systematic literature review was performed to identify all primary reports and studies published during 1998-2008 on hepatitis E in humans and animals in Europe by searching Pubmed, reference lists of major articles and international conference proceedings. Each of the 106 included studies was categorized into one of three evidence levels (EL) based on study design and diagnostic methodology. The evidence was generally weak (73 were assigned to EL1, two to both EL1 and EL2, and 30 to EL2), further compounded by the use of poorly validated serological assays in some studies. Only one case-control study was assigned to EL3. Persons with autochthonous hepatitis E infection were on average older than the general population and predominantly male. There was no evidence for one main transmission route of HEV infection or risk factor for hepatitis E. However, zoonotic transmission seemed likely and person-to-person transmission too inefficient to cause clinical disease. Multiple routes of transmission probably exist and should be further investigated through analytical studies and reliable diagnostic kits. Based on current evidence that points to zoonotic transmission from pigs, thorough cooking of all porcine products, prevention of cross-contamination in the kitchen and improved education for occupationally exposed people (e.g. pig farmers, veterinarians and sewage workers) may help prevent HEV infection. Although evidence for parenteral transmission is limited, it is recommended that a risk assessment is undertaken.

TI Lessons from Nigeria: the role of roads in the geo-temporal progression
   of avian influenza (H5N1) virus
AB The daily progression of the 2006 (January-June) Nigerian avian influenza (AI H5N1) epidemic was assessed in relation to both spatial variables and the generation interval of the invading virus. Proximity to the highway network appeared to promote epidemic dispersal: from the first AI generation interval onwards >20% of all cases were located at <5 km from the nearest major road. Fifty-seven per cent of all cases were located <= 31 km from three highway intersections. Findings suggest that the spatial features of emerging infections could be key in their control. When the spatial location of a transmission factor is well known, such as that of the highway network, and a substantial percentage of cases (e.g. >20%) are near that factor, early interventions focusing on transmission factors, such as road blocks that prevent poultry trade, may be more efficacious than interventions applied only to the susceptible population.

TI RESISTANCE IS FUTILE BUT TOLERANCE CAN EXPLAIN WHY PARASITES DO NOT
   ALWAYS CASTRATE THEIR HOSTS
AB The disease caused by parasites and pathogens often causes sublethal effects that reduce host fecundity. Theory suggests that if parasites can "target" the detrimental effects of their growth on either host mortality or fecundity, they should always fully sterilize. This is because a reduction in host fecundity does not reduce the infectious period and is therefore neutral to a horizontally transmitted infectious organism. However, in nature fully castrating parasites are relatively rare, no doubt in part because of defense mechanisms in the host. Here, we examine in detail the evolution of host defense to the sterilizing effects of parasites and show that intermediate levels of sterility tolerance are found to evolve for a wide range of cost structures. Our key result arises when the host and parasite coevolve. Investment in tolerance by the host may prevent castration, but if host defense is through resistance (by controlling the parasite's growth rate) coevolution by the parasite results in the complete loss of infected host fecundity. Resistance is therefore a waste of resources, but tolerance can explain why parasites do not castrate their hosts. Our results further emphasize the importance of tolerance as opposed to resistance to parasites.

TI HOST-PARASITE GENETIC INTERACTIONS AND VIRULENCE-TRANSMISSION
   RELATIONSHIPS IN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF MONARCH BUTTERFLIES
AB Evolutionary models predict that parasite virulence (parasite-induced host mortality) can evolve as a consequence of natural selection operating on between-host parasite transmission. Two major assumptions are that virulence and transmission are genetically related and that the relative virulence and transmission of parasite genotypes remain similar across host genotypes. We conducted a cross-infection experiment using monarch butterflies and their protozoan parasites from two populations in eastern and western North America. We tested each of 10 host family lines against each of 18 parasite genotypes and measured virulence (host life span) and parasite transmission potential (spore load). Consistent with virulence evolution theory, we found a positive relationship between virulence and transmission across parasite genotypes. However, the absolute values of virulence and transmission differed among host family lines, as did the rank order of parasite clones along the virulence-transmission relationship. Population-level analyses showed that parasites from western North America caused higher infection levels and virulence, but there was no evidence of local adaptation of parasites on sympatric hosts. Collectively, our results suggest that host genotypes can affect the strength and direction of selection on virulence in natural populations, and that predicting virulence evolution may require building genotype-specific interactions into simpler trade-off models.

TI THE EFFECT OF ELEVATED MUTATION RATES ON THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION
   AND VIRULENCE OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA
AB Within-host competition between parasite genotypes can play an important role in the evolution of parasite virulence. For example, competition can increase virulence by imposing selection for parasites that replicate at a faster absolute rate within the host, but may also decrease virulence by selecting for faster relative growth rates through social exploitation of conspecifics. For many parasites, both outcomes are possible. We investigated how competition affected the evolution of virulence of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in caterpillar hosts, over the course of an approximately 60 generation selection experiment. We initiated infections with clonal populations of either wild-type bacteria or an isogenic mutant with an approximately 100-fold higher mutation rate, resulting in low and high between-genotype competition, respectively. We observed the evolution of increased virulence, growth rate, and public goods cheating (exploitation of extracellular iron scavenging siderophores produced by ancestral populations) in mutator but not wild-type, populations. We conclude increases in absolute within-host growth rates appear to be more important than social cheating in driving virulence evolution in this experimental context.

TI Testing the predictive adaptive response in a host-parasite system
AB P>1. Harsh environmental conditions experienced during development can reduce the performance of the same individuals in adulthood. However, the 'predictive adaptive response' hypothesis postulates that if individuals adapt their phenotype during development to the environments where they are likely to live in the future, individuals exposed to harsh conditions in early life perform better when encountering the same harsh conditions in adulthood compared to those never exposed to these conditions before.
   2. Using the common vole (Microtus arvalis) as study organism, we tested how exposure to flea parasitism during the juvenile stage affects the physiology (haematocrit, resistance to oxidative stress, resting metabolism, spleen mass, and testosterone), morphology (body mass, testis mass) and motor performance (open field activity and swimming speed) of the same individuals when infested with fleas in adulthood. According to the 'predictive adaptive response' hypothesis, we predicted that voles parasitized at the adult stage would perform better if they had already been parasitized with fleas at the juvenile stage.
   3. We found that voles exposed to fleas in adulthood had a higher metabolic rate if already exposed to fleas when juvenile, compared to voles free of fleas when juvenile and voles free of fleas in adulthood. Independently of juvenile parasitism, adult parasitism impaired adult haematocrit and motor performances. Independently of adult parasitism, juvenile parasitism slowed down crawling speed in adult female voles.
   4. Our results suggest that juvenile parasitism has long-term effects that do not protect from the detrimental effects of adult parasitism. On the contrary, experiencing parasitism in early-life incurs additional costs upon adult parasitism measured in terms of higher energy expenditure, rather than inducing an adaptive shift in the developmental trajectory.
   5. Hence, our study provides experimental evidence for long term costs of parasitism. We found no support for a predictive adaptive response in this host-parasite system.

TI A Novel Type of Influenza Vaccine: Safety and Immunogenicity of
   Replication-Deficient Influenza Virus Created by Deletion of the
   Interferon Antagonist NS1
AB Background. The nonstructural protein NS1 of influenza virus counteracts the interferon-mediated immune response of the host. By deleting the open reading frame of NS1, we have generated a novel type of influenza vaccine. We studied the safety and immunogenicity of an influenza strain lacking the NS1 gene (Delta NS1-H1N1) in healthy volunteers.
   Methods. Healthy seronegative adult volunteers were randomized to receive either a single intranasal dose of the Delta NS1-H1N1 A/New Caledonia vaccine at 1 of 5 dose levels (6.4, 6.7, 7.0, 7.4, and 7.7 log(10) median tissue culture infective dose) (recipients) n = 36 or placebo (n = 12 recipients).
   Results. Intranasal vaccination with the replication-deficient Delta NS1-H1N1 vaccine was well tolerated. Rhinitis-like symptoms and headache were the most common adverse events identified during the 28-day observation period. Adverse events were similarly distributed between the treatment and placebo groups. Vaccine-specific local and serum antibodies were induced in a dose-dependent manner. In the highest dose group, vaccine-specific antibodies were detected in 10 of 12 volunteers. Importantly, the vaccine also induced neutralizing antibodies against heterologous drift variants.
   Conclusions. We show that vaccination with an influenza virus strain lacking the viral interferon antagonist NS1 induces statistically significant levels of strain-specific and cross-neutralizing antibodies despite the highly attenuated replication-deficient phenotype. Further studies are warranted to determine whether these results translate into protection from influenza virus infection.

TI Evolution of the population structure of Venturia inaequalis, the apple
   scab fungus, associated with the domestication of its host
AB Evaluating the impact of plant domestication on the population structure of the associated pathogens provides an opportunity to increase our understanding of how and why diseases emerge. Here, we investigated the evolution of the population structure of the apple scab fungus Venturia inaequalis in response to the domestication of its host. Inferences were drawn from multilocus microsatellite data obtained from samples collected on (i) the Central Asian Malus sieversii, the main progenitor of apple, (ii) the European crabapple, Malus sylvestris, a secondary progenitor of apple, and (iii) the cultivated apple, Malus x domestica, in orchards from Europe and Central Asia. Using clustering methods, we identified three distinct populations: (i) a large European population on domesticated and wild apples, (ii) a large Central Asian population on domesticated and wild apples in urban and agricultural areas, and (iii) a more geographically restricted population in M. sieversii forests growing in the eastern mountains of Kazakhstan. Unique allele richness and divergence time estimates supported a host-tracking co-evolutionary scenario in which this latter population represents a relict of the ancestral populations from which current populations found in human-managed habitats were derived. Our analyses indicated that the domestication of apple induced a significant change in the genetic differentiation of populations of V. inaequalis in its centre of origin, but had little impact on its population dynamics and mating system. We discuss how the structure of the apple-based agrosystem may have restricted changes in the population structure of the fungus in response to the domestication of its host.

   kestrels (Aves: Falconidae) (Retracted article. See vol. 22, pg. 1185,
   2013)
AB Pathogen diversity is thought to drive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphism given that host's immune repertories are dependent on antigen recognition capabilities. Here, we surveyed an extensive community of pathogens (n = 35 taxa) and MHC diversity in mainland versus island subspecies of the Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus and in a sympatric mainland population of the phylogenetically related lesser kestrel Falco naumanni. Insular subspecies are commonly exposed to impoverished pathogen communities whilst different species' ecologies and contrasting life-history traits may lead to different levels of pathogen exposure. Although specific host traits may explain differential particular infections, overall pathogen diversity, richness and prevalence were higher in the truly cosmopolitan, euriphagous and long-distance disperser Eurasian kestrel than in the estenophagous, steppe-specialist, philopatric but long-distance migratory lesser kestrel. Accordingly, the continental population of Eurasian kestrels displayed a higher number (64 vs. 49) as well as more divergent alleles at both MHC class I and class II loci. Detailed analyses of amino acid diversity revealed that significant differences between both species were exclusive to those functionally important codons comprising the antigen binding sites. The lowest pathogen burdens and the smallest but still quite divergent set of MHC alleles (n = 16) were found in island Eurasian kestrels, where the rates of allele fixation at MHC loci seem to have occurred faster than at neutral markers. The results presented in this study would therefore support the role of pathogen diversity and abundance in shaping patterns of genetic variation at evolutionary relevant MHC genes.

TI Field Validation of a Transcriptional Assay for the Prediction of Age of
   Uncaged Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes in Northern Australia
AB Background: New strategies to eliminate dengue have been proposed that specifically target older Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the proportion of the vector population that is potentially capable of transmitting dengue viruses. Evaluation of these strategies will require accurate and high-throughput methods of predicting mosquito age. We previously developed an age prediction assay for individual Ae. aegypti females based on the transcriptional profiles of a selection of age responsive genes. Here we conducted field testing of the method on Ae. aegypti that were entirely uncaged and free to engage in natural behavior.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We produced "free-range'' test specimens by releasing 8007 adult Ae. aegypti inside and around an isolated homestead in north Queensland, Australia, and recapturing females at two day intervals. We applied a TaqMan probe-based assay design that enabled high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR of four transcripts from three age-responsive genes and a reference gene. An age prediction model was calibrated on mosquitoes maintained in small sentinel cages, in which 68.8% of the variance in gene transcription measures was explained by age. The model was then used to predict the ages of the free-range females. The relationship between the predicted and actual ages achieved an R 2 value of 0.62 for predictions of females up to 29 days old. Transcriptional profiles and age predictions were not affected by physiological variation associated with the blood feeding/egg development cycle and we show that the age grading method could be applied to differentiate between two populations of mosquitoes having a two-fold difference in mean life expectancy.
   Conclusions/Significance: The transcriptional profiles of age responsive genes facilitated age estimates of near-wild Ae. aegypti females. Our age prediction assay for Ae. aegypti provides a useful tool for the evaluation of mosquito control interventions against dengue where mosquito survivorship or lifespan reduction are crucial to their success. The approximate cost of the method was US$7.50 per mosquito and 60 mosquitoes could be processed in 3 days. The assay is based on conserved genes and modified versions are likely to support similar investigations of several important mosquito and other disease vectors.

TI Prevalence and Risk Factors of Porcine Cysticercosis in Angonia
   District, Mozambique
AB Taenia solium is an important zoonosis in many developing countries. Cysticercosis poses a serious public health risk and incurs sizeable economic losses to pig production. Because data on the epidemiology of porcine cysticercosis in Mozambique are scarce, the present study was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors for porcine cysticercosis. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 11 villages in Angonia district, Tete province in northwestern Mozambique. Between September and November, 2007, a total of 661 pigs were tested serologically and examined by tongue inspection. Serum samples were tested for the presence of circulating parasite antigen using a monoclonal antibody-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA). In addition, a questionnaire survey to collect information on pig production, occurrence and transmission of porcine cysticercosis, risk factors and awareness of porcine cysticercosis was conducted in the selected households from which pigs were sampled. Two hundred thirty-one samples (34.9%) were found positive by the Ag-ELISA, while by tongue inspection on the same animals cysticerci were detected in 84 pigs (12.7%). Increasing age (OR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.13-2.37) and free-range pig husbandry system (OR = 3.81; 95% CI = 2.08-7.06) were important risk factors for porcine cysticercosis in the district. The present findings indicate that porcine cysticercosis is endemic in the region, and that increasing pig age and pig husbandry practices contribute significantly to porcine cysticercosis transmission. Further epidemiological studies on the prevalence and transmission of porcine cysticercosis in rural communities in Mozambique are needed to enable collection of more baseline data and implementation of effective control strategies within the country.

TI Disease Limits Populations: Plague and Black-Tailed Prairie Dogs
AB Plague is an exotic vector-borne disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis that causes mortality rates approaching 100% in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). We mapped the perimeter of the active portions of black-tailed prairie dog colonies annually between 1999 and 2005 at four prairie dog colony complexes in areas with a history of plague, as well as at two complexes that were located outside the distribution of plague at the time of mapping and had therefore never been affected by the disease. We hypothesized that the presence of plague would significantly reduce overall black-tailed prairie dog colony area, reduce the sizes of colonies on these landscapes, and increase nearest-neighbor distances between colonies. Within the region historically affected by plague, individual colonies were smaller, nearest-neighbor distances were greater, and the proportion of potential habitat occupied by active prairie dog colonies was smaller than at plague-free sites. Populations that endured plague were composed of fewer large colonies (>100 ha) than populations that were historically plague free. We suggest that these differences among sites in colony size and isolation may slow recolonization after extirpation. At the same time, greater intercolony distances may also reduce intercolony transmission of pathogens. Reduced transmission among smaller and more distant colonies may ultimately enhance long-term prairie dog population persistence in areas where plague is present.

TI Vector Control Improves Survival of Three Species of Prairie Dogs
   (Cynomys) in Areas Considered Enzootic for Plague
AB Plague causes periodic epizootics that decimate populations of prairie dogs (PDs) (Cynomys), but the means by which the causative bacterium ( Yersinia pestis) persists between epizootics are poorly understood. Plague epizootics in PDs might arise as the result of introductions of Y. pestis from sources outside PD colonies. However, it remains possible that plague persists in PDs during interepizootic periods and is transmitted at low rates among highly susceptible individuals within and between their colonies. If this is true, application of vector control to reduce flea numbers might reduce mortality among PDs. To test whether vector control enhances PD survival in the absence of obvious plague epizootics, we reduced the numbers of fleas ( vectors for Y. pestis) 96-98% ( 1 month posttreatment) on 15 areas involving three species of PDs ( Cynomys leucurus, Cynomys parvidens in Utah, and Cynomys ludovicianus in Montana) during 2000-2004 using deltamethrin dust delivered into burrows as a pulicide. Even during years without epizootic plague, PD survival rates at dusted sites were 31-45% higher for adults and 2-34% higher for juveniles compared to survival rates at nondusted sites. Y. pestis was cultured from 49 of the 851 flea pools tested ( 6882 total fleas) and antibodies against Y. pestis were identified in serum samples from 40 of 2631 PDs. Although other explanations are possible, including transmission of other potentially fatal pathogens by fleas, ticks, or other ectoparasites, our results suggest that plague might be maintained indefinitely in PD populations in the absence of free epizootics and widespread mortality among these animals. If PDs and their fleas support enzootic cycles of plague transmission, there would be important implications for the conservation of these animals and other species.

TI Rodent and Flea Abundance Fail to Predict a Plague Epizootic in
   Black-Tailed Prairie Dogs
AB Small rodents are purported to be enzootic hosts of Yersinia pestis and may serve as sources of infection to prairie dogs or other epizootic hosts by direct or flea-mediated transmission. Recent research has shown that small rodent species composition and small rodent flea assemblages are influenced by the presence of prairie dogs, with higher relative abundance of both small rodents and fleas at prairie dog colony sites compared to grass-lands without prairie dogs. However, it is unclear if increased rodent or flea abundance predisposes prairie dogs to infection with Y. pestis. We tracked rodent and flea occurrence for 3 years at a number of prairie dog colony sites in Boulder County, Colorado, before, during, and after a local plague epizootic to see if high rodent or flea abundance was associated with plague-affected colonies when compared to colonies that escaped infection. We found no difference in preepizootic rodent abundance or flea prevalence or abundance between plague-positive and plague-negative colonies. Further, we saw no significant before-plague/after-plague change in these metrics at either plague-positive or plague-negative sites. We did, however, find that small rodent species assemblages changed in the year following prairie dog die-offs at plague-affected colonies when compared to unaffected colonies. In light of previous research from this system that has shown that landscape features and proximity to recently plagued colonies are significant predictors of plague occurrence in prairie dogs, we suggest that landscape context is more important to local plague occurrence than are characteristics of rodent or flea species assemblages.

TI Plague in Mongolia
AB Mongolia is a country of Central Asia that occupies 1,564,116 km 2 and has a population of 2.7 million people. The geography of Mongolia is varied and has a continental climate. Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is enzootic in wild rodent populations over large rural areas of Mongolia. Natural plague foci have occurred over 28.3% of Mongolia, and 47.1% of these foci are highly active. Highly active plague foci exist mainly in the western part of Mongolia. A total of 27% of all plague cultures were isolated from ectoparasites of 12 species of endemic mammals and 1 species of bird. Most plague cultures isolated from ectoparasites of mammals were from fleas (91.5%). The majority of cultures isolated from fleas were from marmot fleas (64.5% of all fleas). The marmot flea (Oropsylla silantiewi) is considered the primary vector of plague. Human cases of plague have been recorded in Mongolia since 1897 and more than 3000 plague cultures were isolated from natural foci. Plague foci occur between 50800-43800 longitude and 88800-120800 latitude and at altitudes between 640 and 3500 m.

TI Multistage Genomewide Association Study Identifies a Locus at 1q41
   Associated with Rate of HIV-1 Disease Progression to Clinical AIDS
AB Background. A mean of 9-10 years of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection elapse before clinical AIDS develops in untreated persons, but this rate of disease progression varies substantially among individuals. To investigate host genetic determinants of the rate of progression to clinical AIDS, we performed a multistage genomewide association study.
   Methods. The discovery stage comprised 156 individuals from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, enriched with rapid and long-term nonprogressors to increase statistical power. This was followed by replication tests of putatively associated genotypes in an independent population of 590 HIV-1-infected seroconverters.
   Results. Significant associations with delayed AIDS progression were observed in a haplotype located at 1q41, 36 kb upstream of PROX1 on chromosome 1 (relative hazard ratio, 0.69; Fisher's combined P = 6.23 x 10(-7)). This association was replicated further in an analysis stratified by transmission mode, with the effect consistent in sexual or mucosal and parenteral transmission (relative hazard ratios, 0.72 and 0.63, respectively; combined P = 1.63 x 10(-6)).
   Conclusions. This study identified and replicated a locus upstream of PROX1 that is associated with delayed progression to clinical AIDS. PROX1 is a negative regulator of interferon-gamma expression in T cells and also mitigates the advancement of vascular neoplasms, such as Kaposi sarcoma, a common AIDS-defining malignancy. This study adds to the cumulative polygenic host component that effectively regulates the progression to clinical AIDS among HIV-1-infected individuals, raising prospects for potential new avenues for therapy and improvements in AIDS prognosis.

TI Thermoregulatory behaviour affects prevalence of chytrid fungal
   infection in a wild population of Panamanian golden frogs
AB Predicting how climate change will affect disease dynamics requires an understanding of how the environment affects host-pathogen interactions. For amphibians, global declines and extinctions have been linked to a pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Using a combination of body temperature measurements and disease assays conducted before and after the arrival of B. dendrobatidis, this study tested the hypothesis that body temperature affects the prevalence of infection in a wild population of Panamanian golden frogs (Atelopus zeteki). The timing of first detection of the fungus was consistent with that of a wave of epidemic infections spreading south and eastward through Central America. During the epidemic, many golden frogs modified their thermoregulatory behaviour, raising body temperatures above their normal set point. Odds of infection decreased with increasing body temperature, demonstrating that even slight environmental or behavioural changes have the potential to affect an individual's vulnerability to infection. The thermal dependency of the relationship between B. dendrobatidis and its amphibian hosts demonstrates how the progression of an epidemic can be influenced by complex interactions between host and pathogen phenotypes and the environments in which they are found.

TI Mutational neighbourhood and mutation supply rate constrain adaptation
   in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
AB Understanding adaptation by natural selection requires understanding the genetic factors that determine which beneficial mutations are available for selection. Here, using experimental evolution of rifampicin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we show that different genotypes vary in their capacity for adaptation to the cost of antibiotic resistance. We then use sequence data to show that the beneficial mutations associated with fitness recovery were specific to particular genetic backgrounds, suggesting that genotypes had access to different sets of beneficial mutations. When we manipulated the supply rate of beneficial mutations, by altering effective population size during evolution, we found that it constrained adaptation in some selection lines by restricting access to rare beneficial mutations, but that the effect varied among the genotypes in our experiment. These results suggest that mutational neighbourhood varies even among genotypes that differ by a single amino acid change, and this determines their capacity for adaptation as well as the influence of population biology processes that alter mutation supply rate.

TI Chikungunya Virus in North-Eastern Italy: A Seroprevalence Survey
AB After an outbreak of Chikungunya infection in Emilia-Romagna Region (North-castern Italy), a survey was performed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibody to Chikungunya virus and the proportion of asymptomatic infections, to identify factors associated with infection, and evaluate the performance of the surveillance system. The method used was a survey on a random sample of residents of the village with the largest number of reported cases. The prevalence was 10.2% (33 of 325), being higher in older people and males, and lower when window screens and insect repellents were used. Only 18% of infected persons were fully asymptomatic, 85% of the 27 symptomatic confirmed cases satisfied the surveillance case definition, and 63% of the persons meeting the criteria for suspect case were identified by the active surveillance system. This study provides basic parameters for modeling the transmission potential of outbreaks and planning control measures for Chikungunya infection in temperate settings.

TI Climate Change Promotes the Emergence of Serious Disease Outbreaks of
   Filarioid Nematodes
AB Filarioid parasites represent major health hazards with important medical, veterinary, and economic implications, and considerable potential to affect the everyday lives of tens of millions of people globally (World Health Organization, 2007). Scenarios for climate change vary latitudinally and regionally and involve direct and indirect linkages for increasing temperature and the dissemination, amplification, and invasiveness of vector-borne parasites. High latitude regions are especially influenced by global climate change and thus may be prone to altered associations and dynamics for complex host-pathogen assemblages and emergence of disease with cascading effects on ecosystem structure. Although the potential for substantial ecological perturbation has been identified, few empirical observations have emanated from systems across the Holarctic. Coincidental with decades of warming, and anomalies of high temperature and humidity in the sub-Arctic region of Fennoscandia, the mosquito-borne filarioid nematode Setaria tundra is now associated with emerging epidemic disease resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality for reindeer and moose. We describe a host-parasite system that involves reindeer, arthropods, and nematodes, which may contribute as a factor to ongoing declines documented for this ungulate species across northern ecosystems. We demonstrate that mean summer temperatures exceeding 14A degrees C drive the emergence of disease due to S. tundra. An association between climate and emergence of filarioid parasites is a challenge to ecosystem services with direct effects on public health, sustainability of free-ranging and domestic ungulates, and ultimately food security for subsistence cultures at high latitudes.

TI Microclimate and Human Factors in the Divergent Ecology of Aedes aegypti
   along the Arizona, US/Sonora, MX Border
AB This study examined the association of human and environmental factors with the presence of Aedes aegypti, the vector for dengue fever and yellow fever viruses, in a desert region in the southwest United States and northwest Mexico. Sixty-eight sites were longitudinally surveyed along the United States-Mexico border in Tucson, AZ, Nogales, AZ, and Nogales, Sonora during a 3-year period. Aedes aegypti presence or absence at each site was measured three times per year using standard oviposition traps. Maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity were measured hourly at each site. Field inventories were conducted to measure human housing factors potentially affecting mosquito presence, such as the use of air-conditioning and evaporative coolers, outdoor vegetation cover, and access to piped water. The results showed that Ae. aegypti presence was highly variable across space and time. Aedes aegypti presence was positively associated with highly vegetated areas. Other significant variables included microclimatic differences and access to piped water. This study demonstrates the importance of microclimate and human factors in predicting Ae. aegypti distribution in an arid environment.

TI Viral diversity and prevalence gradients in North American Pacific Coast
   grasslands
AB Host pathogen interactions may be governed by the number of pathogens coexisting within an individual host (i.e., coinfection) and among different hosts, although most sampling in natural systems focuses on the prevalence of single pathogens and/or single hosts. we measured the prevalence of four barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs) in three grass species at 26 natural grasslands along a 2000-km latitudinal gradient in the western United States and Canada. B/CYDVs are aphid-vectored RNA viruses that cause one of the most prevalent of all plant diseases worldwide. Pathogen prevalence and coinfection were uncorrelated, suggesting that different forces likely drive them. Coinfection, the number of viruses in a single infected host (alpha diversity), did not differ among host species but increased roughly twofold across our latitudinal transect. This increase in coinfection corresponded with a decline in among-host pathogen turnover (beta diversity). suggesting that B/CYDVs in northern populations experience less transmission limitation than in southern populations. In contrast to pathogen diversity, pathogen prevalence was a function of host identity as well as biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. Prevalence declined with precipitation and increased with soil nitrate concentration, an important limiting nutrient for hosts and vectors of B/CYDVs. This work demonstrates the need for further studies of processes governing coinfection. and the utility of applying theory developed to explain diversity in communities of free-living organisms to pathogen systems.

TI Parasites and pathogens lag behind their host during periods of host
   range advance
AB The process of rapid range expansion (as seen in many invasive species, and in taxa responding to climate change) may substantially disrupt host-parasite dynamics. Parasites and pathogens can have strong regulatory effects on their host population and, in doing so, exert selection pressure on host life history. We construct a simple individual-based model of host-parasite dynamics during range expansion. This model shows that the parasites and pathogens of a range-expanding host are likely to be absent from the host's invasion front, because stochastic events (serial founder events) in low-density frontal populations result in local extinctions or transmission failure of the parasite/pathogen and, hence, a preponderance of uninfected hosts in the invasion vanguard. This pattern is true for both density-dependent and density-independent transmission rates, although it is exacerbated in the case of density-dependent transmission because, in this case, transmission rates also decline on the front. Data from field surveys on the prevalence of lungworms (Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala) in invasive cane toads (Bufo marinas) support these predictions, in showing that toads in newly invaded areas of tropical Australia lack the parasite, which only arrives 1-3 years after the toads themselves. The resultant "honeymoon phase" immediately post-invasion, when individuals in the invasion-front population are virtually pathogen-free, may lead to altered host population dynamics on the invasion front, causing, for example, high densities in invasion-front populations, followed by a decline in numbers as parasites and pathogens arrive and begin to reduce host viability. The honeymoon phase may ultimately impact the evolution of life-history investment strategies in both host and parasite on the invasion vanguard, as hosts are released from immune challenges and parasites continuously expand into a favorable and unoccupied niche.

TI Factors driving pathogenicity vs. prevalence of amphibian panzootic
   chytridiomycosis in Iberia
AB P>Amphibian chytridiomycosis is a disease caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Whether Bd is a new emerging pathogen (the novel pathogen hypothesis; NPH) or whether environmental changes are exacerbating the host-pathogen dynamic (the endemic pathogen hypothesis; EPH) is debated. To disentangle these hypotheses we map the distribution of Bd and chytridiomycosis across the Iberian Peninsula centred on the first European outbreak site. We find that the infection-free state is the norm across both sample sites and individuals. To analyse this dataset, we use Bayesian zero-inflated binomial models to test whether environmental variables can account for heterogeneity in both the presence and prevalence of Bd, and heterogeneity in the occurrence of the disease, chytridiomycosis. We also search for signatures of Bd-spread within Iberia using genotyping. We show (1) no evidence for any relationship between the presence of Bd and environmental variables, (2) a weak relationship between environmental variables and the conditional prevalence of infection, (3) stage-dependent heterogeneity in the infection risk, (4) a strong association between altitude and chytridiomycosis, (5) multiple Iberian genotypes and (6) recent introduction and spread of a single genotype of Bd in the Pyrenees. We conclude that the NPH is consistent with the emergence of Bd in Iberia. However, epizootic forcing of infection is tied to location and shaped by both biotic and abiotic variables. Therefore, the population-level consequences of disease introduction are explained by EPH-like processes. This study demonstrates the power of combining surveillance and molecular data to ascertain the drivers of new emerging infections diseases.

TI Potential for Tick-borne Bartonelloses
AB As worldwide vectors of human infectious diseases, ticks are considered to be second only to mosquitoes. Each tick species has preferred environmental conditions and biotopes that determine its geographic distribution, the pathogens it vectors, and the areas that pose risk for tick-borne diseases. Researchers have identified an increasing number of bacterial pathogens that are transmitted by ticks, including Anaplasma, Borrelia, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia spp. Recent reports involving humans and canines suggest that ticks should be considered as potential vectors of Bartonella spp. To strengthen this suggestion, numerous molecular surveys to detect Bartonella DNA in ticks have been conducted. However, there is little evidence that Bartonella spp. can replicate within ticks and no definitive evidence Of transmission by a tick to a vertebrate host.

We evaluated American white pelican nesting colonies in Sheridan County, Montana, USA, for an association between WNV-positive pelican carcasses and human West Nile neuroinvasive disease. Persons in counties hosting affected colonies had a 5x higher risk for disease than those in counties with unaffected colonies. We also investigated WNV infection and blood meal source among mosquitoes and pelican tissue type for greatest WNV detection efficacy in carcasses. WNV-infected Culex tarsalis mosquitoes were detected and blood-engorged Cx. tarsalis contained pelican DNA. Viral loads and detection consistency among pelican tissues were greatest in feather pulp, brain, heart, and skin. Given the risks posed to wildlife and human health, coordinated efforts among wildlife and public health authorities to monitor these pelican colonies for WNV activity are potentially useful.

The study population was composed of 1,400 pregnant women (628 uninfected, 658 infected during pregnancy, 27 infected before pregnancy, and 87 infected on unknown dates). We compared pregnancy outcomes for 655 (628 + 27) women not infected during pregnancy with 658 who were infected during pregnancy. Infection occurred during the first trimester for 15% of the infected women, the second for 59%, and the third for 26%. Only hospital admission during pregnancy differed between infected and uninfected women (40% vs. 29%). Other outcomes (cesarean deliveries, obstetric hemorrhaging, preterm births, stillbirths after 22 weeks, birthweight, congenital malformations, and newborn admissions) were similar. This virus had no observable effect on pregnancy outcomes.

TI How important is vertical transmission in mosquitoes for the persistence
   of dengue? Insights from a mathematical model
AB In many regions dengue incidence fluctuates seasonally with few if any infections reported in unfavourable periods. It has been hypothesized that vertical transmission within the mosquito population allows the virus to persist at these times. A review of the literature shows that vertical infection efficiencies are 1-4%. Using a mathematical model we argue that at these infection rates vertical transmission is not an important factor for long term virus persistence. In endemic situations, increases in reproductive number, half-life and persistence times of the disease only become significant when vertical infection efficiency exceeds 20-30%. In epidemic situations vertical infection accelerates the course of the outbreak and may actually reduce persistence time. These results stem from the fact that the mosquito life-cycle is relatively rapid and vertically acquired infections are multiplicatively diluted with every generation. When the efficiency of vertical infection is as low as reported from empirical studies, the virus is rapidly lost unless there is regular amplification in the human population. Processes such as asymptomatic human dengue cases are therefore more likely to be important in persistence than transmission within the vector population. The empirical data are not, however, unequivocal and we identify several areas of research that would further clarify the role of vertical transmission in the epidemiology of dengue.

A total of 288 IDUs were tested for K8.1 antibodies to HHV-8 lytic antigen. Associations between HHV-8 serostatus and potential risk factors were examined Using univariate and multivarlate logistic regression analysis. Seroprevalence of HHV-8 was 24.3% (95% CI 19.5-29.7), increasing with age from 19.4% in those aged <30 years to 52.9% in those aged >= 40 years (P for trend = 0.003). No statistically significant associations between HHV-8-positive status and gender, educational level, age at first drug injection, needle sharing, number of imprisonments, complications from drug overdose, HIV and HCV were observed. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, older age (>= 40 vs. <40 years, OR 3.30, 95 % CI 1.14-9.56) and report of septicaemia/abscess (yes vs. no, OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.01-3.18) were each independently associated with higher HHV-8 seroprevalence. HHV-8 is highly prevalent in the IDU Population in Greece. The independent association between HHV-8 and reported abscess or septicaemia supports the hypothesis that poor hygiene conditions in the setting of drug injection may contribute to HHV-8 transmission.

TI Paternally derived immune priming for offspring in the red flour beetle,
   Tribolium castaneum
AB P>1. Parasitized females in mammals, fish and birds can enhance the immune defence of their offspring by transferring specific antibodies for the embryo. Likewise, social insect mothers transfer immunity despite the fact that invertebrates lack antibodies.
   2. Female trans-generational immune priming is consistent with parental investment theory, because mothers invest more into rearing their offspring than fathers. However, when immune priming is not directly linked to parental care, as is often the case in insects that abandon their eggs after oviposition, both sexes might benefit from protecting their offspring.
   3. Using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, we show that after parental exposure to heat-killed bacteria, trans-generational immune priming occurs through fathers as well as mothers.
   4. This novel finding challenges the traditional view that males provide only genes to their offspring in species without paternal care, and raises the possibility of a division of tasks with respect to immune protection between parents.

AB P>1. Since Sin Nombre virus was discovered in the U.S. in 1993, longitudinal studies of the rodent reservoir host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) have demonstrated a qualitative correlation among mouse population dynamics and risk of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans, indicating the importance of understanding deer mouse population dynamics for evaluating risk of HPS.
   2. Using capture-mark-recapture statistical methods on a 15-year data set from Montana, we estimated deer mouse survival, maturation and recruitment rates and tested the relative importance of seasonality, population density and local climate in explaining temporal variation in deer mouse demography.
   3. From these estimates, we designed a population model to simulate deer mouse population dynamics given climatic variables and compared the model to observed patterns.
   4. Month, precipitation 5 months previously, temperature 5 months previously and to a lesser extent precipitation and temperature in the current month, were important in determining deer mouse survival. Month, the sum of precipitation over the last 4 months, and the sum of the temperature over the last 4 months were important in determining recruitment rates. Survival was more important in determining the growth rate of the population than recruitment.
   5. While climatic drivers appear to have a complex influence on dynamics, our forecasts were good. Our quantitative model may allow public health officials to better predict increased human risk from basic climatic data.

TI Hidden cytoplasmic incompatibility alters the dynamics of
   male-killer/host interactions
AB Wolbachia manipulate the reproduction of their arthropod hosts in a variety of ways. Recent work has demonstrated that these bacteria may combine phenotypes - possessing a 'male killing' phenotype and, where males survive, induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). We here develop a mathematical model to investigate the extent to which 'hidden' CI may affect the evolutionary dynamics of host genes that suppress male-killing activity. We observed that for high prevalence infections, CI drives both suppressor and bacterium to higher frequency, such that the strain appears to solely exhibit CI. In contrast, for low prevalence infections, CI impedes suppressor invasion as surviving infected males are incompatible with the majority of females in the population. Our results demonstrate that 'hidden' phenotypes as well as observable ones can impact on the dynamics of the interaction, and knowledge of these is therefore required to predict when suppressor genes will invade, and the consequences of their invasion.

TI Ample genetic variation but no evidence for genotype specificity in an
   all-parthenogenetic host-parasitoid interaction
AB Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites can result in negative frequency-dependent selection and may thus be an important mechanism maintaining genetic variation in populations. Negative frequency-dependence emerges readily if interactions between hosts and parasites are genotype-specific such that no host genotype is most resistant to all parasite genotypes, and no parasite genotype is most infective on all hosts. Although there is increasing evidence for genotype specificity in interactions between hosts and pathogens or microparasites, the picture is less clear for insect host-parasitoid interactions. Here, we addressed this question in the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae) and its most important parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum. Because both antagonists are capable of parthenogenetic reproduction, this system allows for powerful tests of genotype x genotype interactions. Our test consisted of exposing multiple host clones to different parthenogenetic lines of parasitoids in all combinations, and this experiment was repeated with animals from four different sites. All aphids were free of endosymbiotic bacteria known to increase resistance to parasitoids. We observed ample genetic variation for host resistance and parasitoid infectivity, but there was no significant host clone x parasitoid line interaction, and this result was consistent across the four sites. Thus, there is no evidence for genotype specificity in the interaction between A. fabae and L. fabarum, suggesting that the observed variation is based on rather general mechanisms of defence and attack.

Plasma samples at entry and at time of virologic failure from patients enrolled in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group study 398 were analyzed by standard genotype, single-genome sequencing and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (K103N and Y181C) to detect and quantify minor NNRTI-resistant variants.
   Results. Minor populations of NNRTI-resistant variants that were missed by standard genotype were detected more often at study entry in NNRTI-experienced patients than NNRTI-naive patients by both single-genome sequencing (8 of 12 vs 3 of 15; P = .022) and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (>1% Y181C, 5 of 22 vs 3 of 72, respectively; P = .016). K103N variants at frequencies >1% were associated with inferior HIV-1 RNA response to efavirenz-containing therapy between entry and week 24 (change in HIV-1 RNA level, +0.5 vs -1.1 log(10) copies/mL; P<.001
   Conclusions. Minor NNRTI-resistant variants were more prevalent in NNRTI-experienced patients and were associated with reduced virologic response to efavirenz-containing multidrug regimens.

TI Insect Infection Model for Campylobacter jejuni Reveals That O-methyl
   Phosphoramidate Has Insecticidal Activity
AB Galleria mellonella (wax moth) larvae have elsewhere been shown to be susceptible to pathogens such as Francisella tularensis, Burkholderia mallei, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We report that the larvae are rapidly killed by Campylobacter jejuni at 37 degrees C. Three strains of C. jejuni tested, 11168H (human diarrheal isolate), G1 (human Guillain-Barre syndrome isolate), and 81-176 (human diarrheal isolate), were equally effective at killing G. mellonella larvae. A panel of defined mutants of C. jejuni 11168H, in known or putative virulence genes, showed different degrees of attenuation in G. mellonella larvae. A mutant lacking the O-methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) capsule side group was attenuated, clearly demonstrating that MeOPN has a role in virulence. This new model of C. jejuni infection should facilitate the identification of novel virulence genes.

TI Temperature Control of Fimbriation Circuit Switch in Uropathogenic
   Escherichia coli: Quantitative Analysis via Automated Model Abstraction
AB Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) represent the predominant cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs). A key UPEC molecular virulence mechanism is type 1 fimbriae, whose expression is controlled by the orientation of an invertible chromosomal DNA element-the fim switch. Temperature has been shown to act as a major regulator of fim switching behavior and is overall an important indicator as well as functional feature of many urologic diseases, including UPEC host-pathogen interaction dynamics. Given this panoptic physiological role of temperature during UTI progression and notable empirical challenges to its direct in vivo studies, in silico modeling of corresponding biochemical and biophysical mechanisms essential to UPEC pathogenicity may significantly aid our understanding of the underlying disease processes. However, rigorous computational analysis of biological systems, such as fim switch temperature control circuit, has hereto presented a notoriously demanding problem due to both the substantial complexity of the gene regulatory networks involved as well as their often characteristically discrete and stochastic dynamics. To address these issues, we have developed an approach that enables automated multiscale abstraction of biological system descriptions based on reaction kinetics. Implemented as a computational tool, this method has allowed us to efficiently analyze the modular organization and behavior of the E. coli fimbriation switch circuit at different temperature settings, thus facilitating new insights into this mode of UPEC molecular virulence regulation. In particular, our results suggest that, with respect to its role in shutting down fimbriae expression, the primary function of FimB recombinase may be to effect a controlled down-regulation (rather than increase) of the ON-to-OFF fim switching rate via temperature-dependent suppression of competing dynamics mediated by recombinase FimE. Our computational analysis further implies that this down-regulation mechanism could be particularly significant inside the host environment, thus potentially contributing further understanding toward the development of novel therapeutic approaches to UPEC-caused UTIs.

TI Lutzomyia Sand Fly Diversity and Rates of Infection by Wolbachia and an
   Exotic Leishmania Species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama
AB Background: Sand flies ( Diptera, Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) in the genus Lutzomyia are the predominant vectors of the protozoan disease leishmaniasis in the New World. Within the watershed of the Panama Canal, the cutaneous form of leishmaniasis is a continuous health threat for residents, tourists and members of an international research community. Here we report the results of screening a tropical forest assemblage of sand fly species for infection by both Leishmania and a microbe that can potentially serve in vector population control, the cytoplasmically transmitted rickettsia, Wolbachia pipientis. Knowing accurately which Lutzomyia species are present, what their evolutionary relationships are, and how they are infected by strains of both Leishmania and Wolbachia is of critical value for building strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease in humans.
   Methodology and Findings: We collected, sorted and then used DNA sequences to determine the diversity and probable phylogenetic relationships of the Phlebotominae occurring in the understory of Barro Colorado Island in the Republic of Panama. Sequence from CO1, the DNA barcoding gene, supported 18 morphology-based species determinations while revealing the presence of two possible "cryptic'' species, one (Lu. sp. nr vespertilionis) within the Vespertilionis group, the other ( Lu. gomezi) within the Lutzomyia-cruciata series. Using ITS-1 and "minicircle'' primers we detected Leishmania DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapidoi, 26.3% of Lu. gomezi individuals and in 0% of the other 18 sand fly species. Identical ITS-1 sequence was obtained from the Leishmania infecting Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi, sequence which was 93% similar to Leishmania ( viannia) naiffi in GenBank, a species previously unknown in Panama, but recognized as a type of cutaneous leishmaniasis vectored broadly across northern and central South America. Distinct strains of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia were detected in three of 20 sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania.
   Conclusions: Both morphological and molecular methods were used to examine an assemblage of 20 sand fly species occurring in the forests of the Panama Canal area. Two of these species, members of separate clades, were found to carry Leishmania at high frequency and hence are likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species. A single Leishmania species, identified with high confidence as Le. naiffi, was carried by both species. That Le. naiffi is known to cause cutaneous lesions in South America but has hitherto not been reported or implicated in Panama opens the possibility that its range has recently expanded to include the Isthmus or that it occurs as a recent introduction. The occurrence of Leishmania and Wolbachia in Lu. trapidoi identifies one important vector of the disease as a potential target for gene introductions using Wolbachia population sweeps.

TI Complete In Vitro Life Cycle of Trypanosoma congolense: Development of
   Genetic Tools
AB Background: Animal African trypanosomosis, a disease mainly caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma congolense, is a major constraint to livestock productivity and has a significant impact in the developing countries of Africa. RNA interference (RNAi) has been used to study gene function and identify drug and vaccine targets in a variety of organisms including trypanosomes. However, trypanosome RNAi studies have mainly been conducted in T. brucei, as a model for human infection, largely ignoring livestock parasites of economical importance such as T. congolense, which displays different pathogenesis profiles. The whole T. congolense life cycle can be completed in vitro, but this attractive model displayed important limitations: (i) genetic tools were currently limited to insect forms and production of modified infectious BSF through differentiation was never achieved, (ii) in vitro differentiation techniques lasted several months, (iii) absence of long-term bloodstream forms (BSF) in vitro culture prevented genomic analyses.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We optimized culture conditions for each developmental stage and secured the differentiation steps. Specifically, we devised a medium adapted for the strenuous development of stable long-term BSF culture. Using Amaxa nucleofection technology, we greatly improved the transfection rate of the insect form and designed an inducible transgene expression system using the IL3000 reference strain. We tested it by expression of reporter genes and through RNAi. Subsequently, we achieved the complete in vitro life cycle with dramatically shortened time requirements for various wild type and transgenic strains. Finally, we established the use of modified strains for experimental infections and underlined a host adaptation phase requirement.
   Conclusions/Significance: We devised an improved T. congolense model, which offers the opportunity to perform functional genomics analyses throughout the whole life cycle. It represents a very useful tool to understand pathogenesis mechanisms and to study potential therapeutic targets either in vitro or in vivo using a mouse model.

TI Influence of Urban Landscapes on Population Dynamics in a Short-Distance
   Migrant Mosquito: Evidence for the Dengue Vector Aedes aegypti
AB Background: Dengue viruses are endemic across most tropical and subtropical regions. Because no proven vaccines are available, dengue prevention is primarily accomplished through controlling the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. While dispersal distance is generally believed to be,100 m, patterns of dispersion may vary in urban areas due to landscape features acting as barriers or corridors to dispersal. Anthropogenic features ultimately affect the flow of genes affecting vector competence and insecticide resistance. Therefore, a thorough understanding of what parameters impact dispersal is essential for efficient implementation of any mosquito population suppression program. Population replacement and genetic control strategies currently under consideration are also dependent upon a thorough understanding of mosquito dispersal in urban settings.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We examined the effect of a major highway on dispersal patterns over a 2 year period. A. aegypti larvae were collected on the east and west sides of Uriah Butler Highway (UBH) to examine any effect UBH may have on the observed population structure in the Charlieville neighborhood in Trinidad, West Indies. A panel of nine microsatellites, two SNPs and a 710 bp sequence of mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) were used for the molecular analyses of the samples. Three CO1 haplotypes were identified, one of which was only found on the east side of the road in 2006 and 2007. AMOVA using mtCO1 and nuclear markers revealed significant differentiation between the east- and west-side collections.
   Conclusion and Significance: Our results indicate that anthropogenic barriers to A. aegypti dispersal exist in urban environments and should be considered when implementing control programs during dengue outbreaks and population suppression or replacement programs.

TI Nodular Worm Infection in Wild Chimpanzees in Western Uganda: A Risk for
   Human Health?
AB This study focused on Oeosophagostomum sp., and more especially on O. bifurcum, as a parasite that can be lethal to humans and is widespread among humans and monkeys in endemic regions, but has not yet been documented in apes. Its epidemiology and the role played by non-human primates in its transmission are still poorly understood. O. stephanostomum was the only species diagnosed so far in chimpanzees. Until recently, O. bifurcum was assumed to have a high zoonotic potential, but recent findings tend to demonstrate that O. bifurcum of non-human primates and humans might be genetically distinct. As the closest relative to human beings, and a species living in spatial proximity to humans in the field site studied, Pan troglodytes is thus an interesting host to investigate. Recently, a role for chimpanzees in the emergence of HIV and malaria in humans has been documented. In the framework of our long-term health monitoring of wild chimpanzees from Kibale National Park in Western Uganda, we analysed 311 samples of faeces. Coproscopy revealed that high-ranking males are more infected than other individuals. These chimpanzees are also the more frequent cropraiders. Results from PCR assays conducted on larvae and dried faeces also revealed that O. stephanostomum as well as O. bifurcum are infecting chimpanzees, both species co-existing in the same individuals. Because contacts between humans and great apes are increasing with ecotourism and forest fragmentation in areas of high population density, this paper emphasizes that the presence of potential zoonotic parasites should be viewed as a major concern for public health. Investigations of the parasite status of people living around the park or working inside as well as sympatric non-human primates should be planned, and further research might reveal this as a promising aspect of efforts to reinforce measures against crop-raiding.

TI Distinct Genetic Diversity of Oncomelania hupensis, Intermediate Host of
   Schistosoma japonicum in Mainland China as Revealed by ITS Sequences
AB Background: Oncomelania hupensis is the unique intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, which causes schistosomiasis endemic in the Far East, and especially in mainland China. O. hupensis largely determines the parasite's geographical range. How O. hupensis's genetic diversity is distributed geographically in mainland China has never been well examined with DNA sequence data.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we investigate the genetic variation among O. hupensis from different geographical origins using the combined complete internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and ITS2 regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. 165 O. hupensis isolates were obtained in 29 localities from 7 provinces across mainland China: lake/marshland and hill regions in Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Jiangsu provinces, located along the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River, and mountainous regions in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses showed distinct genetic diversity and no shared haplotypes between populations from lake/marshland regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and populations from mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The genetic distance between these two groups is up to 0.81 based on Fst, and branch time was estimated as 26 Ma. As revealed in the phylogenetic tree, snails from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces were also clustered separately. Geographical separation appears to be an important factor accounting for the diversification of the two groups of O. hupensis in mainland China, and probably for the separate clades between snails from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. In lake/marshland and hill regions along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, three clades were identified in the phylogenetic tree, but without any obvious clustering of snails from different provinces.
   Conclusions: O. hupensis in mainland China may have considerable genetic diversity, and a more complex population structure than expected. It will be of significant importance to consider the genetic diversity of O. hupensis when assessing co-evolutionary interactions with S. japonicum.

TI Applying the Theory of Island Biogeography to Emerging Pathogens: Toward
   Predicting the Sources of Future Emerging Zoonotic and Vector-Borne
   Diseases
AB Emerging infectious diseases are recognized as increasing threats to public and animal health, global economy, and social and political stability. Climate change, environmental changes, changes in human demographics and behaviors, and the rise of global trade and travel are most-often-cited drivers for the emergence of infectious diseases in human and animal populations (Schrag and Wiener 1995, Daszak et al. 2001, Dobson and Foufo-poulos 2001, May et al. 2001, Taylor et al. 2001, Antia et al. 2003, IOM 2003, Kuiken et al. 2003, Weiss and McMichael 2004, Wolfe et al. 2005, Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005, Chomel et al. 2007, Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007, Jones et al. 2008). Emerging pathogens are more likely to be zoonotic or vector-borne with a broad host range (Daszak et al. 2000, Taylor et al. 2001, Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005, Jones et al. 2008). Emerging pathogens are also more frequently RNA viruses (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005), which may better adapt to and establish in novel host species (Antia et al. 2003, Andre and Day 2005, Woolhouse et al. 2005). Determining the factors driving disease emergence eventually aims at assisting the prediction of the future emergence of infectious diseases. However, because of the multifactorial nature of the drivers involved (IOM 2003), our ability to predict which pathogens may arise in human or animal populations in the future remains limited (WHO/FAO/OIE 2004). In particular, the ability to identify the animal reservoirs where the greatest risks to human health will originate was deemed improbable (WHO/FAO/OIE 2004). Applying the theory of island biogeography (MacArthur and Wilson 1967) to emerging pathogens identifies (i)interactions between recipient host species and species sources of pathogens (including vector species), (ii) interactions within species sources of pathogens, and (iii) interactions within recipient host species, as mechanisms directly driving disease emergence. Most identified drivers for disease emergence correspond to changes in one or more of these three sets of interactions. Importantly, applying the theory of island biogeography to emerging pathogens assists in predicting from which animal species future zoonotic and vector-borne pathogens will most probably emerge. Identifying known and unknown pathogens such species harbor may bring us one step forward toward predicting which pathogen will next emerge in human populations.

TI Stray Dogs as Reservoirs of the Zoonotic Agents Leptospira interrogans,
   Trypanosoma cruzi, and Aspergillus spp. in an Urban Area of Chiapas in
   Southern Mexico
AB This investigation determined the presence and prevalence of the zoonotic agents Leptospira interrogans, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Aspergillus spp. in the stray dog population (a total of 224 stray dogs) in an urban area of Southern Mexico. Blood serum samples were taken from all dogs, and root hair samples were taken from dogs with skin lesions and partial alopecia. IgG antibodies for L. interrogans from 10 serovars were detected using the microscopic agglutination test. Immunofluorescence antibody test and Western blot assay were used for serologic diagnosis of T. cruzi. The Sabouraud medium was used to isolate Aspergillus spp. Prevalence of L. interrogans was 4.9%, which was determined by identifying only serovars Pyrogenes, which accounted for 3.6%, and Tarassovi, which constituted 1.3%, with titers from 1:100 to 1:800. Additionally, T. cruzi antibodies were detected in 4.5% of the dogs. Skin lesions were found in 43% of the dogs (98/224), and 35 cultures were positive for Aspergillus spp. (35.7%, p < 0.05, 95% confidence interval 2.45-3.67), identified as A. niger (82.8%), A. flavus (14.3%), and A. terreus (2.9%). This study demonstrates the presence of certain zoonotic agents (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi) in stray dogs living within the studied area. Dogs play an important role in the transmission of diseases that are potentially harmful to humans. Although the prevalence of canine leptospirosis and trypanosomiasis is not high in Southern Mexico compared with other tropical regions of Mexico, the presence of these zoonotic agents in the stray dog population demonstrates that the stray dog population in this region is a significant reservoir and potential source of infection in humans. Special care should be taken when handling stray dogs that exhibit skin lesions with partial alopecia, since a pathological Aspergillus sp. fungus may be present.

TI The Effects of West Nile Virus on the Reproductive Success and
   Overwinter Survival of Eastern Bluebirds in Alabama
AB We tested for negative effects of West Nile virus (WNV) on a breeding population of eastern bluebirds in Alabama by comparing fecundity and reproductive success in years before and after the arrival of WNV and by comparing fecundity, reproductive success, and overwinter survival of seropositive and seronegative individuals within the same population in the same years. We found that female bluebirds were more likely to be seropositive than male bluebirds. Age and individual condition did not affect likelihood of being seropositive. Being seropositive for WNV was not associated with any negative effects on reproduction or survival. However, female fecundity was higher in years after WNV compared to years before the arrival of WNV. The reproductive success of males who tested positive for WNV exposure was higher than that of males that were seronegative. Overall, we found no negative effects on reproduction or survival after exposure to WNV.

TI Low-Level CD4(+) T Cell Activation in HIV-Exposed Seronegative Subjects:
   Influence of Gender and Condom Use
AB Immune activation has been suggested to increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission, while at the same time it could be deemed essential for mounting an effective antiviral immune response. In this study, we compared levels of T cell activation between exposed seronegative (ESN) partners in HIV-1 discordant couples and HIV-unexposed control subjects in Dakar, Senegal. ESN subjects showed lower levels of CD38 expression on CD4(+) T cells than did control subjects. However, this was found to be associated with concurrent differences in the use of condoms: ESN subjects reported a higher degree of condom use than did control subjects, which correlated inversely with CD38 expression. In addition, we observed markedly higher levels of T cell activation in women compared with men, irrespective of sexual behavior. These findings question the relevance of low-level CD4(+) T cell activation in resistance to HIV-1 infection and underscore the need to take gender and sexual behavior characteristics of high-risk populations into account when analyzing correlates of protective immunity.

TI Dissection of the Molecular Basis for Hypervirulence of an In
   Vivo-Selected Phenotype of the Widely Disseminated M1T1 Strain of Group
   A Streptococcus Bacteria
AB Group A streptococci (GAS) may engage different sets of virulence strategies, depending on the site of infection and host context. We previously isolated 2 phenotypic variants of a globally disseminated M1T1 GAS clone: a virulent wild-type (WT) strain, characterized by a SpeB(+)/SpeA(-)/Sda1(low) phenotype, and a hypervirulent animal-passaged (AP) strain, better adapted to survive in vivo, with a SpeB(-)/SpeA(+)/Sda1(high) phenotype. This AP strain arises in vivo due to the selection of bacteria with mutations in covS, the sensor part of a key 2-component regulatory system, CovR/S. To determine whether covS mutations explain the hypervirulence of the AP strain, we deleted covS from WT bacteria (Delta CovS) and were able to simulate the hypervirulence and gene expression phenotype of naturally selected AP bacteria. Correction of the covS mutation in AP bacteria reverted them back to the WT phenotype. Our data confirm that covS plays a direct role in regulating GAS virulence.

TI Staphylococcal Strains Vary Greatly in Their Ability to Induce an
   Inflammatory Response in Endothelial Cells
AB Background. Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen of endovascular diseases that can take an acute destructive course and/or develop into a chronic infection with a high rate of relapse. Despite good activity of the appropriate antimicrobial substances in vitro, these infections are often difficult to treat, perhaps because of the complex infection process of endovascular tissue.
   Methods. We used the microarray technique to analyze the response of endothelial cells to different S. aureus strains, including highly virulent isolates (6850 and ST239); the Cowan I strain, which has a nonfunctioning accessory gene regulator (agr) quorum-sensing system; and various clinical isolates.
   Results. All tested strains were equally invasive in endothelial cells and were found intracellularly, but they differed greatly in their ability to induce inflammation. Wild-type isolates (6850 and ST239) up-regulated a huge number of genes, including many genes involved in innate immunity. By contrast, Cowan I, which failed to express important virulence factors related to the agr system (eg, alpha-toxin and proteases), did not induce these dramatic changes in endothelial gene expression. Similar results were obtained with clinical isolates.
   Conclusion. Given that agr-defective strains are commonly recovered during colonization and infection, agr deficiency might represent a strategy of S. aureus to hide intracellularly without provoking the host immune system and causing relapsing infections.

TI Temperature-dependent transmission of rotavirus in Great Britain and The
   Netherlands
AB In Europe, rotavirus gastroenteritis peaks in late winter or early spring suggesting a role for weather factors in transmission of the virus. In this study, multivariate regression models adapted for time-series data were used to investigate effects of temperature, humidity and rainfall on reported rotavirus infections and the infection-rate parameter, a derived measure of infection transmission that takes into account population immunity, in England, Wales, Scotland and The Netherlands. Delayed effects of weather were investigated by introducing lagged weather terms into the model. Meta-regression was used to pool together country-specific estimates. There was a 13 per cent (95% confidence interval (CI), 11-15%) decrease in reported infections per 1 degrees C increase in temperature above a threshold of 5 degrees C and a 4 per cent (95% CI, 3-5%) decrease in the infection-rate parameter per 1 degrees C increase in temperature across the whole temperature range. The effect of temperature was immediate for the infection-rate parameter but delayed by up to four weeks for reported infections. There was no overall effect of humidity or rainfall. There is a direct and simple relationship between cold weather and rotavirus transmission in Great Britain and The Netherlands. The more complex and delayed temperature effect on disease incidence is likely to be mediated through the effects of weather on transmission.

TI Mixed genotype transmission bodies and virions contribute to the
   maintenance of diversity in an insect virus
AB An insect nucleopolyhedrovirus naturally survives as a mixture of at least nine genotypes. Infection by multiple genotypes results in the production of virus occlusion bodies (OBs) with greater pathogenicity than those of any genotype alone. We tested the hypothesis that each OB contains a genotypically diverse population of virions. Few insects died following inoculation with an experimental two-genotype mixture at a dose of one OB per insect, but a high proportion of multiple infections were observed (50%), which differed significantly from the frequencies predicted by a non-associated transmission model in which genotypes are segregated into distinct OBs. By contrast, insects that consumed multiple OBs experienced higher mortality and infection frequencies did not differ significantly from those of the non-associated model. Inoculation with genotypically complex wild-type OBs indicated that genotypes tend to be transmitted in association, rather than as independent entities, irrespective of dose. To examine the hypothesis that virions may themselves be genotypically heterogeneous, cell culture plaques derived from individual virions were analysed to reveal that one-third of virions was of mixed genotype, irrespective of the genotypic composition of the OBs. We conclude that co-occlusion of genotypically distinct virions in each OB is an adaptive mechanism that favours the maintenance of virus diversity during insect-to-insect transmission.

   falciparum Dihydrofolate Reductase Haplotypes in The Gambia
AB A high-level pyrimethamine resistance Plasmodium falciparum lineage with triple dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) mutations prevails across Africa. However, additional minority lineages were seen. We examined transmission success of mutant dhfr haplotypes among 22 children in The Gambia and 60 infected Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes fed on their blood. Additional polymorphic genes of the gametocyte-specific protein (pfg377) and merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) were examined. Similarities were seen between pfg377 and MSP-1 alleles in children and mosquitoes and evidence of cross-mating between different parasite genotypes was seen in some infected mosquitoes, reflecting high transmission success of existing clones. With regard to dhfr, 16 haplotypes were seen among the children: 2 carried double mutations and 14 carried triple mutations. However, only nine haplotypes, all with triple mutations, were detected among mosquitoes. A single triple-mutant dhfr haplotype, similar to that in other countries in Africa, predominated among children (42%) and mosquitoes (60%), supporting the hypothesis of migration of this haplotype across Africa. However, evidence of cross-mating between the above haplotypes signifies the role of local evolution.

Fifteen focus group discussions stratified by sex, age, and motherhood status were conducted in 2008 in Iquitos, Peru. All participants said they would accept using a GPS unit for study purposes for 2-4 weeks. Participants' main concerns included caring properly for the unit, whether the unit would audio/videotape them, health effects of prolonged use, responsibility for units, and confidentiality of information. A pilot study was then conducted in which 126 persons were asked to carry GPS units for 2-4 weeks; 98% provided consent. All persons used the units expressing minimal concerns, although 44% reported forgetting the device at least once. Our study is the first to highlight participant concerns related to use of GPS for long-term monitoring of individual behavior in a resource-limited setting.

TI Parasites lost - do invaders miss the boat or drown on arrival?
AB P>Host species that colonize new regions often lose parasite species. Using population arrival and establishment data for New Zealand's introduced bird species and their ectoparasitic chewing lice species, we test the relative importance of different processes and mechanisms in causing parasite species loss. Few lice failed to arrive in New Zealand with their hosts due to being missed by chance in the sample of hosts from the original population (missing the boat). Rather, most lice were absent because their hosts or the parasite themselves failed to establish populations in their new environment. Given they arrived and their host established, parasite persistence was more strongly related to factors associated with transmission efficiency (number of host individuals introduced, host body size, host sociality and parasite suborder) than parasite propagule pressure and aggregation. Such insights into parasite success are invaluable to both understanding and managing their impact.

TI Reassortment of Human Rotavirus Gene Segments into G11 Rotavirus Strains
AB G11 rotaviruses are believed to be of porcine origin. However, a limited number of G11 rotaviruses have been recently isolated from humans in combination with P[25], P[8], P[6], and P[4]. To investigate the evolutionary relationships of these strains, we analyzed the complete genomes of 2 human G11P[25] strains, 2 human G11P[8] strains, and 3 porcine reference strains. Most of the 11 gene segments of these 7 strains belonged to genotype 1 (Wa-like). However, phylogenetic clustering patterns suggested that an unknown G11P[25] strain with a new I12 VP6 genotype was transmitted to the human population, in which it acquired human genotype 1 gene segments through reassortment, resulting in a human G11P[8] rotavirus strain with an entire human Wa-genogroup backbone. This Wa-like backbone is believed to have caused the worldwide spread of human G9 and G12 rotaviruses. G11 human rotavirus strains should be monitored because they may also become major human pathogens.

TI Modelling the impact of varicella vaccination on varicella and zoster
AB It has been suggested that the incidence of herpes zoster may increase due to lack of natural boosting under large-scale vaccination with the varicella vaccine. To study the possibility and magnitude of such negative consequences of mass vaccination, we built a mathematical model of varicella and zoster epidemiology in the Finnish population. The model was based on serological data on varicella infection, case-notification data on zoster, and new knowledge about close contacts relevant to transmission of infection. According to the analysis, a childhood programme against varicella will increase the incidence of zoster by one to more than two thirds in the next 50 years. This will be due to increase in case numbers in the >= 35 years age groups. However, high vaccine coverage and a two-dose programme will be very effective in stopping varicella transmission in the population.

TI Micro and macro population effects in disease transmission: the case of
   varicella
AB Profiles of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) seroprevalence have shown large variability in European countries in which vaccination has not been implemented. Differences in micro and macro population structures (e.g. household and municipality, respectively) may explain such variability, which is the focus of a population-based study of varicella in 12 000 children from 7800 French households in Corsica. The cumulative incidence was 89 ()A at age 11 years, as the median age at infection was 5 years in first-born children, but decreased to 3-9 years in younger siblings. Hazard of infection in households increased as the first-born child initially enrolled in primary school. Age at infection was higher in less populated areas. Household attack rates increased with age (55 % in <6 months, >90% in >3 years) and household secondary attack rate was similar to 70 %. Several levels of population structure independently affect age at varicella infection.

TI Case-control study on Puumala virus infection: smoking is a risk factor
AB Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) is apparently transmitted to humans by inhalation of aerosolized secretions of carrier rodents (bank voles). The means of transmission and the associated risk factors are poorly defined. An epidemiological study during the peak of an epidemic season in Finland was conducted based on 282 acute clinical PUUV infections and 204 controls without PUUV infection or immunity. The main risk factors adjusted by age, sex and living environment were cigarette smoking [odds ratio (OR) 3.6, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) P <0.0001] and buildings with holes allowing rodents to enter (OR 3.3, 95% Cl 2.0-5.6); these results were similar in two subsets. Further, use of rodent traps (OR3-5, 95% Cl 2.2-5.7) and handling firewood (OR 2.7, 95% Cl 1.6-4.4) were associated with a risk. The risk attributed to smoking also remained high using simulated population controls with average smoking habits. The results suggest that hantavirus transmission occurs by inhalation mainly indoors and is dependent on the condition of the respiratory tract.

TI ADAPTATION RATES OF LYTIC VIRUSES DEPEND CRITICALLY ON WHETHER HOST
   CELLS SURVIVE THE BOTTLENECK
AB We use a branching process approach to estimate the substitution rate, the rate at which beneficial mutations occur and fix, in populations of lytic viruses whose growth is controlled by periodic population bottlenecks. Our model predicts that substitution rates, and by extension adaptation rates, are profoundly affected by the survival of infected host cells at the bottleneck. In particular, we find that direct transfer (or environmental) bottlenecks, in which some fraction of both free virus and host cells are preserved, are associated with relatively slow adaptation rates for the virus. In contrast, viruses can adapt much more quickly when only free virus is transferred to a new host population, as is typical in an epidemiological setting. Finally, when premature lysis of the host-cell population is induced at the bottleneck, we predict that adaptation rates for the virus will, in general, be faster still. These results hold irrespective of the life-history trait affected by the beneficial mutation. The substitution rates in the presence of environmental bottlenecks are predicted to be as much as an order of magnitude lower than in the other two cases.

TI Manipulating the jasmonate response: How do methyl jasmonate additions
   mediate characteristics of aboveground and belowground mutualisms?
AB P>1. Plants use a range of sophisticated strategies to protect themselves against herbivores and pathogens, such as the production of jasmonates, a group of plant hormones that prime the plant's defense system upon attack. However, defense-related mechanisms, such as the jasmonate response, play a more diverse role than previously appreciated. Jasmonates also regulate key mutualist relationships, leading to a suit of potential conflicting selection pressures as a single response is employed to mediate multiple species interactions.
   2. Here, we experimentally manipulate the host's jasmonate response and document the impact on two key plant mutualisms: (i) changes to arbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts belowground (ii) modifications to floral traits affecting pollinator mutualists aboveground. By exogenously applying a range of methyl jasmonate solutions to cucumber plant roots grown with and without mycorrhizal fungi, we are able to examine the potential costs of the jasmonate response to both above and belowground mutualists.
   3. We demonstrate that the negative effect of jasmonates on floral traits depends on whether the plant is mycorrhizal or nonmycorrhizal. Mycorrhization had a positive effect on floral traits, but benefits were lost with jasmonate application. While low levels of jasmonate decreased floral traits, these same jasmonate levels increased colonization by the mycorrhizal symbiont three-fold, but only under high phosphorus conditions.
   4. Our results highlight potential conflicts for the host in the regulation of their mutualists under different conditions and suggest that the overall impact of the jasmonate response depends on the plant mycorrhizal status and its nutrient context.
   5. These findings suggest that increasing the jasmonate response may lead to differential costs and benefits for plants and their mutualists, and highlight potential conflict in planta, with mycorrhizal symbionts benefiting from intermediate levels of jasmonates while certain floral traits can be depressed at this same level.

TI Synergistic effects of glyphosate formulation and parasite infection on
   fish malformations and survival
AB P>1. Anthropogenic pollution and disease can cause both lethal and sub-lethal effects in aquatic species but our understanding of how these stressors interact is often not known. Contaminants can reduce host resistance to disease, but whether hosts are impacted at environmentally relevant concentrations is poorly understood.
   2. We investigated the independent and combined effects of exposure to the common herbicide glyphosate and the trematode parasite Telogaster opisthorchis on survival and the development of spinal malformations in juvenile Galaxias anomalus, a New Zealand freshwater fish. We then investigated how exposure to a glyphosate concentration gradient (0 center dot 36, 3 center dot 6, 36 mg active ingredient (a.i.) L-1) affected the production and release of the infective cercarial stage of the parasite by its snail intermediate host Potamopyrgus antipodarum.
   3. Survival of juvenile fish was unaffected by exposure to glyphosate alone (at an environmentally relevant concentration; 0 center dot 36 mg a.i. L-1) or by T. opisthorchis infection alone. However, simultaneous exposure to infection and glyphosate significantly reduced fish survival.
   4. Juvenile fish developed spinal malformations when exposed either to infections alone or to infections and glyphosate, with a trend towards greater severity of spinal malformation after exposure to both stressors.
   5. All snails exposed to the highest glyphosate concentration (36 mg a.i. L-1) died within 24 h. Snails exposed to a moderate concentration (3 center dot 6 mg a.i. L-1) produced significantly more T. opisthorchis cercariae than snails in the control group or the low concentration group (0 center dot 36 mg a.i. L-1; the same concentration as in the fish experiment).
   6. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to show that parasites and glyphosate can act synergistically on aquatic vertebrates at environmentally relevant concentrations, and that glyphosate might increase the risk of disease in fish. Our results have important implications when identifying risks to aquatic communities and suggest that threshold levels of glyphosate currently set by regulatory authorities do not adequately protect freshwater systems.

TI Evolution of reproductive effort in viscous populations: the importance
   of population dynamics
AB I present two ecological models for the evolution of reproductive effort in viscous populations with empty sites. In contrast with previous studies, I show that limited dispersal needs not have a positive effect on the evolutionarily stable allocation of resources to fecundity versus survival. Rather, depending on the feedback between the trait and the population dynamics, population viscosity may have no effect or even lead to a decrease in the evolutionarily stable reproductive effort when individuals can degrade their environment during their lifetime. I show that the different evolutionary outcomes can be explained by the asymmetry in the level of kin competition resulting from investing into juveniles or into adults.

TI Prenatal Protease Inhibitor Use and Risk of Preterm Birth among
   HIV-Infected Women Initiating Antiretroviral Drugs during Pregnancy
AB Background. Conflicting results have been reported among studies of protease inhibitor (PI) use during pregnancy and preterm birth. Uncontrolled confounding by indication may explain some of the differences among studies.
   Methods. In total, 777 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women in a prospective cohort who were not receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment at conception were studied. Births <37 weeks gestation were reviewed, and deliveries due to spontaneous labor and/or rupture of membranes were identified. Risk of preterm birth and low birth weight (<2500 g) were evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression.
   Results. Of the study population, 558 (72%) received combination ARV with PI during pregnancy, and a total of 130 preterm births were observed. In adjusted analyses, combination ARV with PI was not significantly associated with spontaneous preterm birth, compared to ARV without PI (odds ratio [OR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-2.12). Sensitivity analyses that included women who received ARV prior to pregnancy also did not identify a significant association (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.84-2.16). Low birth weight results were similar.
   Conclusions. No evidence of an association between use of combination ARV with PI during pregnancy and preterm birth was found. Our study supports current guidelines that promote consideration of combination ARV for all HIV-infected pregnant women.

TI West Nile virus may have hitched a ride across the Western United States
   on Culex tarsalis mosquitoes
AB West Nile virus spread rapidly from east to west across North America, despite the north-south migratory flyways of its avian hosts. In this issue, Venkatesan & Rasgon (2010) present new data on the population genetics of Culex tarsalis, the dominant West Nile virus vector in the Western United States, suggesting that patterns of mosquito gene flow may better reflect the virus's expansion from the Midwest to the Pacific than patterns of bird movement. These findings suggest a more significant role for vector dispersal in arboviral range expansion than has previously been appreciated, and they highlight the value of molecular genetic studies of insect vector populations for understanding epidemiology and disease ecology.

TI Fine-scale spatial and temporal population genetics of Aedes japonicus,
   a new US mosquito, reveal multiple introductions
AB The newly introduced mosquito Aedes japonicus has expanded from its original range in Northeastern Asia to 29 US states (including Hawaii) plus Canada and northern Europe. Our objectives were to test an earlier hypothesis of multiple introductions of this species to the Northeastern US and evaluate putative temporal changes in genetic makeup. Using a panel of seven microsatellite loci, we confirmed the existence of two abundant genetic forms in specimens originally collected in 1999-2000 (F(ST) value based on microsatellite data = 0.26) that matches the disjunctive distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes. To examine the distribution of the two genetic 'types' across Pennsylvania we created a fine-scale genetic map of Ae. japonicus using 439 specimens collected from 54 Pennsylvania counties in 2002-2003. We also made direct comparisons between collections in 1999-2000 and new collections made in 2004-2005 obtained from the same areas in the northeastern US. We observed that the strong association between mtDNA haplotype and microsatellite signature seen in 1999-2000 had weakened significantly by 2002 across Pennsylvania, a trend continued to some extent in 2004-2005 in PA, NJ, and NY, indicating that once easily distinguishable separate introductions are merging. The two expanding genetic forms create a complex correlation between spatial and genetic distances. The existence of multiple introductions would be obscured without sampling early and across time with highly polymorphic molecular markers. Our results provide a high-resolution analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of a newly introduced disease vector and argue that successive introductions may be a common pattern for invasive mosquitoes.

TI Population genetic data suggest a role for mosquito-mediated dispersal
   of West Nile virus across the western United States
AB After introduction, West Nile virus (WNV) spread rapidly across the western United States between the years 2001 and 2004. This westward movement is thought to have been mediated by random dispersive movements of resident birds. Little attention has been placed on the role of mosquito vectors in virus dispersal across North America. The mosquito vector largely responsible for WNV amplification and transmission of WNV in the western USA is Culex tarsalis. Here we present population genetic data that suggest a potential role for C. tarsalis in the dispersal of WNV across the western USA. Population genetic structure across the species range of C. tarsalis in the USA was characterized in 16 states using 12 microsatellite loci. structure and geneland analyses indicated the presence of three broad population clusters. Barriers to gene flow were resolved near the Sonoran desert in southern Arizona and between the eastern Rocky Mountains and High Plains plateau. Small genetic distances among populations within clusters indicated that gene flow was not obstructed over large portions of the West Coast and within the Great Plains region. Overall, gene flow in C. tarsalis appears to be extensive, potentially mediated by movement of mosquitoes among neighbouring populations and hindered in geographically limited parts of its range. The pattern of genetic clustering in C. tarsalis is congruent with the pattern of invasion of WNV across the western United States, raising the possibility that movement of this important vector may be involved in viral dispersal.

TI Landscape Genetics Reveals Focal Transmission of a Human Macroparasite
AB Macroparasite infections (e.g., helminths) remain a major human health concern. However, assessing transmission dynamics is problematic because the direct observation of macroparasite dispersal among hosts is not possible. We used a novel landscape genetics approach to examine transmission of the human roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides in a small human population in Jiri, Nepal. Unexpectedly, we found significant genetic structuring of parasites, indicating the presence of multiple transmission foci within a small sampling area (similar to 14 km(2)). We analyzed several epidemiological variables, and found that transmission is spatially autocorrelated around households and that transmission foci are stable over time despite extensive human movement. These results would not have been obtainable via a traditional epidemiological study based on worm counts alone. Our data refute the assumption that a single host population corresponds to a single parasite transmission unit, an assumption implicit in many classic models of macroparasite transmission. Newer models have shown that the metapopulation-like pattern observed in our data can adversely affect targeted control strategies aimed at community-wide impacts. Furthermore, the observed metapopulation structure and local mating patterns generate an excess of homozygotes that can accelerate the spread of recessive traits such as drug resistance. Our study illustrates how molecular analyses complement traditional epidemiological information in providing a better understanding of parasite transmission. Similar landscape genetic approaches in other macroparasite systems will be warranted if an accurate depiction of the transmission process is to be used to inform effective control strategies.

   sensu lato into Mountain Ecosystems, Following a Shift in the
   Altitudinal Limit of Distribution of Their Vector, Ixodes ricinus
   (Krkonose Mountains, Czech Republic)
AB The altitudinal shift in the limit of Ixodes ricinus occurrence above the previously established altitude of 750 m above sea level has been monitored over the long-term (2002-2008) in the Krkonose Mts. (Giant Mts.), the highest in the Czech Republic, along two vertical transects in their eastern and central parts (600-1020 and 600-1270 m). Ticks were collected by flagging three times annually, and examined individually by PCR or RT-PCR for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato or tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). A total of 5999 I. ricinus ticks were tested. TBEV RNA was detected in 26 ticks at up to 1140 m. Demonstration of TBEV in two larvae of I. ricinus indicates transovarial transmission. Similar infection rates in larvae and nymphs show vertical transmission in TBEV circulation to be very important under these mountain conditions. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto was found at up to 1040-1065 m, Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii up to 1080-1140 m, and Borrelia valaisiana up to 1270 m. The total infection rates of nymphs and larvae were 7.3% and 2%, respectively. B. garinii was the most prevalent (37%), followed by B. afzelii (29%), B. burgdorferi s.s. (11%), and B. valaisiana (9%). Double to quadruple coinfections were detected in 32% of the infected ticks, most frequently B. garinii/B. afzelii. Predominance of B. garinii and B. valaisiana over B. afzelii suggests that small passerine birds moving on the ground are responsible for permanent local populations of I. ricinus in mountain localities with low numbers of small terrestrial mammals. The detection of B. burgdorferi sensu lato and TBEV in host-seeking larvae indicates an autochthonic infection. Upon analysis of the local climate we consider climate warming to be responsible for the spreading of ticks and tick-transmitted pathogens to higher altitudes.

TI Larval Environmental Temperature and the Susceptibility of Aedes
   albopictus Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae) to Chikungunya Virus
AB A key feature in the recent widespread epidemic of the mosquito-borne alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was the important role of Aedes albopictus, formerly regarded as a secondary vector, compared to the presumed primary vector Aedes aegypti. Ae. albopictus, a container-inhabiting mosquito, is an invasive species that occurs over a wide geographic range spanning tropical and temperate latitudes. In this study we examine the effects of a broad range of larval rearing temperatures on CHIKV infection, dissemination, and viral titer in Florida F(1) Ae. albopictus. Adults from larvae reared at 18 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 32 degrees C differed significantly in size, development time, and CHIKV infection rate. Adult females with the largest body size were produced from the coolest temperature, took the longest to mature, and six times more likely to be infected with CHIKV than females reared at 32 degrees C. There was also a significant effect of rearing temperature on viral dissemination, resulting in an increase in population dissemination at the coolest temperature. This study indicates that climate factors, such as temperature, experienced at the larval stage, can influence the competence of adult females to vector arboviruses.

TI Blood-Feeding Behavior of Aedes albopictus, a Vector of Chikungunya on
   La Reunion
AB Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has long been considered to be transmitted to humans by the human-biting mosquito Aedes aegypti, especially in Africa. However, the recent outbreak of CHIKV involved another vector, Aedes albopictus, and serological data in the literature suggest that several species of domestic or human-related vertebrates can be contaminated by this virus. However, the role of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes as potential enzootic vectors for CHIKV has not yet been evaluated. Here we investigate Ae. albopictus feeding and resting behaviors in an area where a CHIKV epidemic recently occurred, which means deciphering host-seeking and feeding behaviors on several vertebrate species, measuring endophagous/exophagous (activity), endophilic/exophilic (resting) behaviors and its diel (24 h, day/night) biting activity. Ae. albopictus was found to have bimodal daily feeding activities and was found to have exophagic (89%) and exophilic (87%) behaviors. Ae. albopictus showed an opportunistic feeding behavior on a wide range of hosts (from cold-blooded to warm-blooded animals), supporting that it can be implicated in various vertebrate-virus pathosystems. However, with equal availability of one of the four vertebrate hosts (calf, chicken, dog, and goat) proposed against human, Ae. albopictus significantly preferred human, supporting earlier data about its high degree of anthropophily. Multiple blood feeding was also reported in every combination (animal/human) offered to Ae. albopictus, enlightening the higher risks to spread an arbovirus to human population because of interrupted feeding. Such catholic behavior suggests that Ae. albopictus may act as a bridge vector for zoonotic viruses. Further epidemiological implications of this issue are discussed.

   of Dengue and Chikungunya in Central Africa
AB Since its discovery in Nigeria in 1991, Aedes albopictus has invaded much of Central Africa, a region where Ae. aegypti also occurs. To assess the relationship between the invasion by Ae. albopictus and the recent emergence of dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), we undertook vector competence experiments on populations collected from Cameroon and conducted field investigations during concurrent epidemics of DENV and CHIKV in Gabon. Overall, infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different between Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti when exposed to titers of 10(8.1) mosquito infectious dose 50/mL and 10(7.5) plaque forming units/mL of DENV type 2 and CHIKV, respectively. Field investigations showed that Ae. albopictus readily bit man, was abundant, and outnumbered Ae. aegypti to a large extent in Gabon, particularly in suburban environments. Nevertheless, Ae. aegypti was predominant in the more urbanized central parts of Libreville. In this city, CHIKV and DENV were detected only in Ae. albopictus. These data strongly suggest that Ae. albopictus acted as the major vector of both viruses in Libreville in 2007, impacting on the epidemiology of DENV and CHIKV in this area.

TI Infection, Dissemination, and Transmission of a West Nile Virus Green
   Fluorescent Protein Infectious Clone by Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus
   Mosquitoes
AB We report the construction and comparative characterization of a full-length West Nile virus (WNV) cDNA infectious clone (ic) that contains a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression cassette fused within the viral open reading frame. Virus derived from WNV-GFP ic stably infected Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus mosquitoes at comparable rates to virus derived from the parental (non-GFP) ic. However, insertion of this GFP cassette resulted in a temporal delay in in vivo replication kinetics and significantly decreased dissemination to head tissue. Consistent with previous reports of WNV-infected mosquito midguts, focal GFP expression was observed at 3 days post-infection (dpi), with the majority of posterior midgut epithelial cells being positive by 7 dpi. GFP foci were observed in one pair of salivary glands (1/15) dissected 14 dpi. Mice exposed to WNV-GFP-infected mosquitoes developed viremia, and GFP was detected in lymph node homogenates. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy to generate a replication competent construct with increased reporter gene stability that may be used to study early events in infection.

Parasite detection in mammals is performed by polymerase chain reaction assays and confirmed by Southern blot analysis and hybridization test with a universal probe. Results showed significant differences in the levels of T. cruzi infection between the compared periods. We suggest that the major El Nino event occurred in 1997-1998, a large-scale global climatic fluctuation, could be indirectly explaining the extremely high T. cruzi infection in 1999-2000 by means of a time-lag response of the wild transmission cycle of Chagas disease in semiarid Chile after the irruption of small rodent populations.

TI Relative Transmissibility of an R5 Clade C Simian-Human Immunodeficiency
   Virus Across Different Mucosae in Macaques Parallels the Relative Risks
   of Sexual HIV-1 Transmission in Humans via Different Routes
AB Background. Worldwide, similar to 90% of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmissions occur mucosally; almost all involve R5 strains. Risks of sexual HIV acquisition are highest for rectal, then vaginal, and finally oral exposures.
   Methods. Mucosal lacerations may affect the rank order of susceptibility to HIV but cannot be assessed in humans. We measured relative virus transmissibility across intact mucosae in macaques using a single stock of SHIV-1157ipd3N4, a simian-human immunodeficiency virus encoding a primary R5 HIV clade C env (SHIV-C).
   Results. The penetrability of rhesus macaque mucosae differed significantly, with rectal challenge requiring the least virus, followed by vaginal and then oral routes (P = 0.31, oral vs vaginal; P < .001 rectal vs vaginal). These findings imply that intrinsic mucosal properties are responsible for the differential mucosal permeability. The latter paralleled the rank order reported for humans, with relative risk estimates within the range of epidemiological human studies. To test whether inflammation facilitates virus transmission - as predicted from human studies we established a macaque model of localized buccal inflammation. Systemic infection occurred across inflamed but not normal buccal mucosa.
   Conclusion. Our primate data recapitulate virus transmission risks observed in humans, thus establishing R5 SHIV-1157ipd3N4 in macaques as a robust model system to study cofactors involved in human mucosal HIV transmission and its prevention.

TI No Increase in Prevalence of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Mutant in a
   Population of Children and Adolescents Who Were Fully Covered by
   Universal Infant Immunization
AB Background. Mutants of the a determinant of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) can escape neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies and prevail in an immunized population.
   Methods. We evaluated the a mutants in a pediatric population surveyed in 2004 and compared these findings with the data of previous surveys.
   Results. There were 38 children and 74 adolescents who were HBsAg positive, and serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was obtained and tested from 31 and 34 of them, respectively. The a mutants were found in 7 (22.6%) of 31 HBV DNA-positive children and in 7 (0.10%) of 7234 children, the entire population that was surveyed in 2004. After the beginning of universal immunization, the very low prevalence of mutants has remained unchanged for 20 years. More a mutants were found in immunized than in nonimmunized HBV DNA-positive children aged 1-4 years old (31% vs 4%, P = .016) but not in those children aged 5-12 years old. Approximately 68% of immunized, mutant-infected children had carrier mothers. More a mutants emerged in children immunized with plasma-derived vaccines than in those immunized with recombinant vaccines (14 of 5166 vs 3 of 4970, respectively; P = .04) HBV DNA levels were significantly lower in hepatitis B e antigen-positive sera containing the G145R mutant than were levels in sera containing wild-type virus. HBsAg-negative sera containing a mutants had very low HBV DNA levels.
   Conclusions. Less infectivity of G145R, recombinant vaccine use, and mutant loss with older age seem to decrease the a mutant prevalence in an immunized population over time.

TI Asymptomatic Rotavirus Infections in England: Prevalence,
   Characteristics, and Risk Factors
AB Rotavirus is a major cause of infectious intestinal disease in young children; a substantial prevalence of asymptomatic infection has been reported across all age groups. In this study, the authors determined characteristics of asymptomatic rotavirus infection and potential risk factors for infection. Healthy persons were recruited at random from the general population of England during the Study of Infectious Intestinal Disease in England (1993-1996). Rotavirus infection was identified using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare exposures reported by participants with rotavirus infection with those of participants who tested negative. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing responses in the data set. The age-adjusted prevalence of asymptomatic rotavirus infection was 11%; prevalence was highest in children under age 18 years. Attendance at day care was a risk factor for asymptomatic rotavirus infection in children under age 5 years; living in a household with a baby that was still in diapers was a risk factor in older adults. The results suggest that asymptomatic rotavirus infection is transmitted through the same route as rotavirus infectious intestinal disease: person-to-person contact. More work is needed to understand the role of asymptomatic infections in transmission leading to rotavirus disease.

In a large-scale effectiveness study. IPTi was introduced in April 2005 by existing health staff through routine contacts in 12 randomly selected divisions out of 24 in 6 districts of rural southern Tanzania. Coverage and effects on malaria and anemia were estimated through a representative survey in 2006 with 600 children aged 2-11 months. Coverage of IPTi was 47-76% depending on the definition. Using an intention to treat analysis, parasitemia prevalence was 31% in intervention and 38% in comparison areas (P = 0.06). In a "per protocol" analysis of children who had recently received IPTi, parasite prevalence was 22%, 19 percentage points lower than comparison children (P = 0.01). IPTi can be implemented on a large scale by existing health service staff, with a measurable population effect on malaria, within 1 year of launch.

We tested pellet formulations of a monomolecular film (Agnique) and (S)-methoprene (Altosid) under laboratory and field conditions. In the laboratory. Agnique provided 80% control for 20 days, whereas Altosid, in combination with Agnique, provided 80% control for > 60 days. During field trials. the 1:1 pellet ratio of combined products provided > 95% control for at least 32 clays and 50% control for at least 50 days. Altosid remained effective after a 107-day laboratory-induced drought, suggesting that the product serves as a means of control during drought conditions and against spring broods in temperate regions. Agnique and Altosid. when used in tandem for cryptic, difficult-to-treat locations, can provide long-term control of Ae. albopictus larvae and pupae. The possible additive or synergistic effects of the combined products deserve further investigation.

TI Elevated resource availability sufficient to turn opportunistic into
   virulent fish pathogens
AB There is mounting evidence that organic or inorganic enrichment of aquatic environments increases the risk of infectious diseases, with disease agents ranging from helminth parasites to fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens. The causal link between microbial resource availability and disease risk is thought to be complex and, in the case of so-called "opportunistic pathogens," to involve additional stressors that weaken host resistance (e.g., temperature shifts or oxygen deficiencies). In contrast to this perception, our experiment shows that the link between resource levels and infection of fish embryos can be very direct: increased resource availability can transform benign microbial communities into virulent ones. We find that embryos can be harmed before further stresses (e.g., oxygen depletion) weaken them, and treatment with antibiotics and fungicides cancels the detrimental effects. The changed characteristics of symbiotic microbial communities could simply reflect density-dependent relationships or be due to a transition in life-history strategy. Our findings demonstrate that simple microhabitat changes can be sufficient to turn "opportunistic" into virulent pathogens.

TI Social behavior drives the dynamics of respiratory disease in threatened

AB Since the early 1990s, morbidity and mortality in tortoise populations have been associated with a transmissible, mycoplasmal upper respiratory tract disease (URTD). Although the etiology, transmission, and diagnosis of URTD have been extensively studied, little is known about the dynamics of disease transmission in free-ranging tortoise populations. To understand the transmission dynamics of Mycoplasma agassizii, the primary etiological agent of URTD in wild tortoise populations, we studied 11 populations of free-ranging gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus; n = 1667 individuals) over five years and determined their exposure to the pathogen by serology, by clinical signs, and by detection of the pathogen in nasal lavages. Adults tortoises (n = 759) were 11 times more likely to be seropositive than immature animals (n=242) (odds ratio = 10.6, 95% CI = 5.7-20, P < 0.0001). Nasal discharge was observed in only 1.4% (4/296) of immature tortoises as compared with 8.6% (120/1399) of adult tortoises. Nasal lavages from all juvenile tortoises (n=283) were negative by PCR for mycoplasmal pathogens associated with URTD. We tested for spatial segregation among tortoise burrows by size class and found no consistent evidence of clustering of either juveniles or adults. We suggest that the social behavior of tortoises plays a critical role in the spread of URTD in wild populations, with immature tortoises having minimal interactions with adult tortoises, thereby limiting their exposure to the pathogen. These findings may have broader implications for modeling horizontally transmitted diseases in other species with limited parental care and emphasize the importance of incorporating animal behavior parameters into disease transmission studies to better characterize the host-pathogen dynamics.

TI Benefits of host genetic diversity for resistance to infection depend on
   parasite diversity
AB Host populations with high genetic diversity are predicted to have lower levels of infection prevalence. This theory assumes that host genetic diversity results in variation in susceptibility and that parasites exhibit variation in infectivity. Empirical studies on the effects of host heterogeneity typically neglect the role of parasite diversity. We conducted three laboratory experiments designed to test if genetic variation in Daphnia magna populations and genetic variation in its parasites together influence the course of parasite spread after introduction. We found that a natural D. magna population exhibited variation in susceptibility to infection by three parasite species and had strong host clone parasite species interactions. There was no effect of host heterogeneity in experimental host populations (polycultures and monocultures) separately exposed to single strains of three parasite species. When we manipulated the genetic diversity of a single parasite species and exposed them to host monocultures and polycultures, we found that parasite prevalence increased with the number of parasite strains. Host monocultures exposed to several parasite strains had higher mean parasite prevalence and higher variance than polycultures. These results indicate that effect of host genetic diversity on the spread of infection depends on the level of genetic diversity in the parasite population.

TI Detecting interspecific macroparasite interactions from ecological data:
   patterns and process
AB P>There is great interest in the occurrence and consequences of interspecific interactions among co-infecting parasites. However, the extent to which interactions occur is unknown, because there are no validated methods for their detection. We developed a model that generated abundance data for two interacting macroparasite (e.g., helminth) species, and challenged the data with various approaches to determine whether they could detect the underlying interactions. Current approaches performed poorly - either suggesting there was no interaction when, in reality, there was a strong interaction occurring, or inferring the presence of an interaction when there was none. We suggest the novel application of a generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM)-based approach, which we show to be more reliable than current approaches, even when infection rates of both parasites are correlated (e.g., via a shared transmission route). We suggest that the lack of clarity regarding the presence or absence of interactions in natural systems may be largely attributed to the unreliable nature of existing methods for detecting them. However, application of the GLMM approach may provide a more robust method of detection for these potentially important interspecific interactions from ecological data.

TI IDENTIFYING COEVOLUTIONARY PATTERNS IN HUMAN LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN (HLA)
   MOLECULES
AB The antigenic peptide, major histocompatibility complex molecule (MHC; also called human leukocyte antigen, HLA), coreceptor CD8, or CD4 and T-cell receptor (TCR) function as a complex to initiate effectors' mechanisms of the immune system. The tight functional and physical interaction among these molecules may have involved strong coevolution links among domains within and between proteins Despite the importance of unraveling such dependencies to understand the arms race of host-pathogen interaction, no previous studies have aimed at achieving such an objective. Here, we perform an exhaustive coevolution analysis and show that indeed such dependencies are strongly shaping the evolution and probably the function of these molecules. We identify intramolecular coevolution in HLA class I and II at domains important for their immune activity Most of the amino acid sites identified to be coevolving in HLAI have been also detected to undergo positive Darwinian selection highlighting therefore their adaptive value We also identify coevolution among antigen-binding pockets (P1-P9) and among these and TCR-binding sites. Conversely to HLAI, coevolution is weaker in HLAII. Our results support that such coevolutionary patterns are due to selective pressures of host-pathogen coevolution and cooperative binding of TCRs, antigenic peptides, and CD8/CD4 to HLAI and HLAII

TI Personality, space use and tick load in an intrdfoduced population of
   Siberian chipmunks Tamias sibiricus
AB P>1. Although behaviours can contribute to the heterogeneity in parasite load among hosts, links between consistent individual differences in behaviour and parasitic infection have received little attention. We investigated the role of host activity and exploration on hard tick infestations of marked individuals in a population of Siberian chipmunks Tamias sibiricus introduced in a suburban French forest over 3 years.
   2. Individual activity-exploration profiles were assessed from 106 hole-board tests on 73 individuals, and chipmunks' trappability and trap diversity were used respectively as indices of their activity-exploration and space use on a sub-sample of 60 individuals. At each capture, we counted the total number of ticks per head of chipmunk.
   3. We found significant and consistent individual differences in activity-exploration, trappability, trap diversity and tick load, and could estimate individual indices for these four variables, corrected for confounding effects of year, season, body mass and sex.
   4. Using a path analysis, we found an indirect effect of activity-exploration on tick load: tick load increased with space use, which in turn was positively affected by trappability in the field. Trappability was itself positively related to activity-exploration in the hole board. Habitat type affected tick load, independently of behavioural traits. A second path model revealed a lack of either direct or indirect influence of tick loads on chipmunks' personality and trappability.
   5. Our results show that host personality-related patterns in space use can lead to a non-random parasite distribution among hosts.

TI Differential effects of experimental increases in sociality on
   ectoparasites of free-ranging raccoons
AB P>1. Parasite transmission depends on the rate at which hosts come into contact with one another or the infectious stages of parasites. However, host contact rates and their influence on parasite transmission are difficult to quantify in natural settings and can fluctuate with host behaviour and the ecological constraints of parasites.
   2. We investigated how experimental increases in rates of contact and social aggregation affected ectoparasite prevalence and intensity of free-ranging raccoons (Procyon lotor). Twelve independent raccoon populations were subjected to differential resource provisions for 2 years: a clumped food distribution to aggregate hosts (n = 5 aggregated populations), a dispersed food distribution to control for the effects of food without aggregating hosts (n = 3) and a no food treatment (n = 4).
   3. Remote cameras indicated that aggregation sizes and rates of contact were three to four times greater in aggregated compared with that in non-aggregated populations. The number of ticks (adult Dermacentor variabilis) on raccoons in aggregated populations was 1 center dot 5-2 center dot 5 times greater from May to July, the primary time of tick seasonal occurrence. Conversely, louse (Trichodectes octomaculatus) populations were c. 40% sparser on male raccoons in aggregated (compared with that in non-aggregated) populations because of greater overdispersion of lice and a larger number of male hosts harbouring fewer parasites. No treatment-related differences were found among fleas (Orchopeas howardi).
   4. These results were not consistent with our current understanding of parasite transmission; greater rates of host sociality led to increases in a parasite that does not rely on host contact for transmission (ticks) and declines in a parasite that depends on host contact for transmission (lice). We concluded that D. variabilis increased in aggregated sites because they can detect and seek out hosts and were more likely to drop off after obtaining a blood meal and re-attach to raccoons in these locations. Several factors may have contributed to sparser louse populations on male hosts, including a dilution effect that lowered per capita infestation levels.
   5. These results indicate that ectoparasites can interact in unique ways with their hosts that are not consistent with other types of parasite species or models of their transmission.

TI Parasites and deleterious mutations: interactions influencing the
   evolutionary maintenance of sex
AB The restrictive assumptions associated with purely genetic and purely ecological mechanisms suggest that neither of the two forces, in isolation, can offer a general explanation for the evolutionary maintenance of sex. Consequently, attention has turned to pluralistic models (i.e. models that apply both ecological and genetic mechanisms). Existing research has shown that combining mutation accumulation and parasitism allows restrictive assumptions about genetic and parasite parameter values to be relaxed while still predicting the maintenance of sex. However, several empirical studies have shown that deleterious mutations and parasitism can reduce fitness to a greater extent than would be expected if the two acted independently. We show how interactions between these genetic and ecological forces can completely reverse predictions about the evolution of reproductive modes. Moreover, we demonstrate that synergistic interactions between infection and deleterious mutations can render sex evolutionarily stable even when there is antagonistic epistasis among deleterious mutations, thereby widening the conditions for the evolutionary maintenance of sex.

TI Origins of cheating and loss of symbiosis in wild Bradyrhizobium
AB Rhizobial bacteria nodulate legume roots and fix nitrogen in exchange for photosynthates. These symbionts are infectiously acquired from the environment and in such cases selection models predict evolutionary spread of uncooperative mutants. Uncooperative rhizobia - including nonfixing and non-nodulating strains - appear common in agriculture, yet their population biology and origins remain unknown in natural soils. Here, a phylogenetically broad sample of 62 wild-collected rhizobial isolates was experimentally inoculated onto Lotus strigosus to assess their nodulation ability and effects on host growth. A cheater strain was discovered that proliferated in host tissue while offering no benefit; its fitness was superior to that of beneficial strains. Phylogenetic reconstruction of Bradyrhizobium rDNA and transmissible symbiosis-island loci suggest that the cheater evolved via symbiotic gene transfer. Many strains were also identified that failed to nodulate L. strigosus, and it appears that nodulation ability on this host has been recurrently lost in the symbiont population. This is the first study to reveal the adaptive nature of rhizobial cheating and to trace the evolutionary origins of uncooperative rhizobial mutants.

TI High Heritability of Malaria Parasite Clearance Rate Indicates a Genetic
   Basis for Artemisinin Resistance in Western Cambodia
AB In western Cambodia, malaria parasites clear slowly from the blood after treatment with artemisinin derivatives, but it is unclear whether this results from parasite, host, or other factors specific to this population. We measured heritability of clearance rate by evaluating patients infected with identical or nonidentical parasite genotypes, using methods analogous to human twin studies. A substantial proportion (56%-58%) of the variation in clearance rate is explained by parasite genetics. This has 2 important implications: (1) selection with artemisinin derivatives will tend to drive resistance spread and (2) because heritability is high, the genes underlying parasite clearance rate may be identified by genome-wide association.

TI Wolbachia modulates Chikungunya replication in Aedes albopictus
AB The Aedes albopictus mosquito has been involved as the principal vector of recent major outbreaks due to the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The species is naturally infected by two strains of Wolbachia (wAlbA and wAlbB). Wolbachia infections are thought to have spread by manipulating the reproduction of their hosts; cytoplasmic incompatibility is the mechanism used by Wolbachia to invade natural populations of many insects including Ae. albopictus. Here, we report a study on the effects of removing Wolbachia from Ae. albopictus on CHIKV replication and examine the consequences of CHIKV infection on some life-history traits (survival and reproduction) of Wolbachia-free Ae. albopictus. We found that Wolbachia-free mosquitoes maintained a highly heterogeneous CHIKV replication compared to Wolbachia-infected individuals. In Wolbachia-infected Ae. albopictus, the regular increase of CHIKV followed by a steady viral load from day 4 post-infection onwards was concomitant with a decline in Wolbachia density. This profile was also detected when examining the two key organs for viral transmission, the midgut and the salivary glands. Moreover, Wolbachia-free Ae. albopictus was not altered in life-history traits such as survival, oviposition and hatching characteristics whether infected or not with CHIKV. We found that Wolbachia is not essential for viral replication, its presence could lead to optimize replication from day 4 post-infection onwards, coinciding with a decrease in Wolbachia density. Wolbachia may regulate viral replication in Ae. albopictus, with consequences on survival and reproduction.

TI The absence of concordant population genetic structure in the
   black-tailed prairie dog and the flea, Oropsylla hirsuta, with
   implications for the spread of Yersinia pestis
AB The black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) is a keystone species on the mid- and short-grass prairies of North America. The species has suffered extensive colony extirpations and isolation as a result of human activity including the introduction of an exotic pathogen, Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of sylvatic plague. The prairie dog flea, Oropsylla hirsuta, is the most common flea on our study colonies in north-central Montana and it has been shown to carry Y. pestis. We used microsatellite markers to estimate the level of population genetic concordance between black-tailed prairie dogs and O. hirsuta in order to determine the extent to which prairie dogs are responsible for dispersing this potential plague vector among prairie dog colonies. We sampled fleas and prairie dogs from six prairie dog colonies in two regions separated by about 46 km. These colonies were extirpated by a plague epizootic that began months after our sampling was completed in 2005. Prairie dogs showed significant isolation-by-distance and a tendency toward genetic structure on the regional scale that the fleas did not. Fleas exhibited higher estimated rates of gene flow among prairie dog colonies than the prairie dogs sampled from the same colonies. While the findings suggested black-tailed prairie dogs may have contributed to flea dispersal, we attributed the lack of concordance between the population genetic structures of host and ectoparasite to additional flea dispersal that was mediated by mammals other than prairie dogs that were present in the prairie system.

TI Spatial and temporal dynamics of rabies virus variants in big brown bat
   populations across Canada: footprints of an emerging zoonosis
AB Phylogenetic analysis of a collection of rabies viruses that currently circulate in Canadian big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) identified five distinct lineages which have emerged from a common ancestor that existed over 400 years ago. Four of these lineages are regionally restricted in their range while the fifth lineage, comprising two-thirds of all specimens, has emerged in recent times and exhibits a recent demographic expansion with rapid spread across the Canadian range of its host. Four of these viral lineages are shown to circulate in the US. To explore the role of the big brown bat host in dissemination of these viral variants, the population structure of this species was explored using both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellite markers. These data suggest the existence of three subpopulations distributed in British Columbia, mid-western Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan) and eastern Canada (Quebec and Ontario), respectively. We suggest that these three bat subpopulations may differ by their level of female phylopatry, which in turn affects the spread of rabies viruses. We discuss how this bat population structure has affected the historical spread of rabies virus variants across the country and the potential impact of these events on public health concerns regarding rabies.

TI IL-4R alpha-Independent Expression of Mannose Receptor and Ym1 by
   Macrophages Depends on their IL-10 Responsiveness
AB IL-4R alpha-dependent responses are essential for granuloma formation and host survival during acute schistosomiasis. Previously, we demonstrated that mice deficient for macrophage-specific IL-4R alpha (LysM(cre) Il4ra(-/lox)) developed increased hepatotoxicity and gut inflammation; whereas inflammation was restricted to the liver of mice lacking T cell-specific IL-4R alpha expression (iLck(cre) Il4ra(-/lox)). In the study presented here we further investigated their role in liver granulomatous inflammation. Frequencies and numbers of macrophage, lymphocyte or granulocyte populations, as well as Th1/Th2 cytokine responses were similar in Schistosoma mansoni-infected LysM(cre) Il4ra(-/lox) liver granulomas, when compared to Il4ra(-/lox) control mice. In contrast, a shift to Th1 responses with high IFN-gamma and low IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 was observed in the severely disrupted granulomas of iLck(cre) Il4ra(-/lox) and Il4ra(-/)-mice. As expected, alternative macrophage activation was reduced in both LysM(cre) Il4ra(-/lox) and iLck(cre) Il4ra(-/lox) granulomas with low arginase 1 and heightened nitric oxide synthase RNA expression in granuloma macrophages of both mouse strains. Interestingly, a discrete subpopulation of SSC(high) CD11b(+)I-A/I-E(high)CD204(+) macrophages retained expression of mannose receptor (MMR) and Ym1 in LysM(cre)Il4ra(-/lox) but not in iLck(cre)Il4ra(-/lox) granulomas. While aaM circle dot were in close proximity to the parasite eggs in Il4ra(-/lox) control mice, MMR(+)Ym1(+) macrophages in LysM(cre)Il4ra(-/lox) mice were restricted to the periphery of the granuloma, indicating that they might have different functions. In vivo IL-10 neutralisation resulted in the disappearance of MMR+Ym1+ macrophages in LysM(cre)Il4ra(-/lox) mice. Together, these results show that IL-4R alpha-responsive T cells are essential to drive alternative macrophage activation and to control granulomatous inflammation in the liver. The data further suggest that in the absence of macrophage-specific IL-4R alpha signalling, IL-10 is able to drive mannose receptor-and Ym1-positive macrophages, associated with control of hepatic granulomatous inflammation.

TI Epidemiology of Dengue Virus in Iquitos, Peru 1999 to 2005:
   Interepidemic and Epidemic Patterns of Transmission
AB Background: Comprehensive, longitudinal field studies that monitor both disease and vector populations for dengue viruses are urgently needed as a pre-requisite for developing locally adaptable prevention programs or to appropriately test and license new vaccines.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We report the results from such a study spanning 5 years in the Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru where DENV infection was monitored serologically among similar to 2,400 members of a neighborhood-based cohort and through school-based absenteeism surveillance for active febrile illness among a subset of this cohort. At baseline, 80% of the study population had DENV antibodies, seroprevalence increased with age, and significant geographic variation was observed, with neighborhood-specific age-adjusted rates ranging from 67.1 to 89.9%. During the first 15 months, when DENV-1 and DENV-2 were co-circulating, population-based incidence rates ranged from 2-3 infections/100 person-years (p-years). The introduction of DENV-3 during the last half of 2001 was characterized by 3 distinct periods: amplification over at least 5-6 months, replacement of previously circulating serotypes, and epidemic transmission when incidence peaked at 89 infections/100 p-years.
   Conclusions/Significance: Neighborhood-specific baseline seroprevalence rates were not predictive of geographic incidence patterns prior to the DENV-3 introduction, but were closely mirrored during the invasion of this serotype. Transmission varied geographically, with peak incidence occurring at different times among the 8 geographic zones in similar to 16 km(2) of the city. The lag from novel serotype introduction to epidemic transmission and knowledge of spatially explicit areas of elevated risk should be considered for more effective application of limited resources for dengue prevention.

TI Entomological Factors Affecting the Low Endemicity of Chagas Disease in
   Nazca, Southwestern Peru
AB Chagas disease is prevalent in Peru. The province of Nazca, in the southwestern region of the country, shows a high intradomiciliary infestation rate of Triatoma infestans bugs. Although the vector is present, the number of Chagas disease cases appears to be much lower than those reported in the neighboring region of Arequipa. We examined 624 T. infestans from Nazca to determine the current Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates, and found that no bugs were infected with this parasite. These results contrast with those found in Arequipa, where 19-30% triatomines have been reported infected. To compare their vectorial capacity, we infected 30 T. infestans specimens, selected both from Nazca and Arequipa, by feeding bugs on T. cruzi-infected mice. The parasites developed all stages expected in the vector; furthermore, the infective stage, metacyclic trypomastigote, was found in both insect populations from the second week after infection. In addition, those insects that accepted to be fed with mice blood defecated immediately after finishing blood meal, indicating that they might be efficient vectors. We maintain that differences observed in infection rates between vectors from Nazca and Arequipa may be explained by differences in host availability. In Arequipa hosts are mainly small animals, whereas in Nazca the main blood source comes from birds, which are refractory to the infection.

TI Winter Ecology of Buggy Creek Virus (Togaviridae, Alphavirus) in the
   Central Great Plains
AB A largely unanswered question in the study of arboviruses is the extent to which virus can overwinter in adult vectors during the cold winter months and resume the transmission cycle in summer. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV; Togaviridae, Alphavirus) is an unusual arbovirus that is vectored primarily by the swallow bug (Hemiptera: Cimicidae: Oeciacus vicarius) and amplified by the ectoparasitic bug's main avian hosts, the migratory cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) and resident house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Bugs are sedentary and overwinter in the swallows' mud nests. We evaluated the prevalence of BCRV and extent of infection in swallow bugs collected at different times in winter (October-early April) in Nebraska and explored other ecological aspects of this virus's overwintering. BCRV was detected in 17% of bug pools sampled in winter. Virus prevalence in bugs in winter at a site was significantly correlated with virus prevalence at that site the previous summer, but winter prevalence did not predict BCRV prevalence there the following summer. Prevalence was higher in bugs taken from house sparrow nests in winter and (in April) at colony sites where sparrows had been present all winter. Virus detected by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction in winter was less cytopathic than in summer, but viral RNA concentrations of samples in winter were not significantly different from those in summer. Both of the BCRV lineages (A, B) overwintered successfully, with lineage A more common at sites with house sparrows and (in contrast to summer) generally more prevalent in winter than lineage B. BCRV's ability to overwinter in its adult vector probably reflects its adaptation to the sedentary, long-lived bug and the ecology of the cliff swallow and swallow bug host-parasite system. Its overwintering mechanisms may provide insight into those of other alphaviruses of public health significance for which such mechanisms are poorly known.

TI Zero Prevalence of Influenza A Virus in Two Raptor Species by Standard
   Screening
AB Disease can have severe impact on animal populations, especially in rare species. Baseline data for atypical host species are missing for a range of infectious diseases, although such hosts are potentially more affected than the normal vectors and reservoir species. If highly pathogenic avian influenza strikes rare birds of prey, this may have crucial impact on the predator species itself, but also on the food web in which it interacts. Here we present the first large-scale screening of raptors that regularly consume birds belonging to the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses. Influenza A virus prevalence was studied in two rare raptors, the white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Nestlings were screened for active (181 white-tailed sea eagles and 168 peregrine falcons) and past (123 white-tailed sea eagles and 6 peregrine falcons) infection in 2006-2007, and an additional 20 succumbed adult white-tailed sea eagles were sampled in 2003-2006. Neither high-nor low-pathogenic influenza infections were found in our sample, but this does not rule out that the former may have major impact on rare raptors and their food webs.

TI Salivary Gland Protein Repertoire from Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes
AB Diseases caused by arthropod-borne viruses are a significant threat to the health of human and animal populations throughout the world. Better knowledge of the molecules synthesized in the salivary gland and saliva of hematophagous arthropods could be of use for improving the control of pathogen transmission. Recently, a sialome analysis of three Aedes aegypti mosquito colonies (PAEA, Rockefeller, and Formosus) carried out in our laboratory allowed us to identify 44 saliva proteins. Of these secreted proteins, none was exclusively expressed in one colony, suggesting that expression of salivary proteins is highly conserved across populations. In another study, we reported that some of these salivary proteins could be used as the genus-specific markers for travelers' exposure to mosquito vectors. Here, comparison of salivary gland protein profiles between these same three Ae. aegypti colonies was performed using the one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) difference gel electrophoresis method. As observed at the saliva level, no significant differences were detected between these three colonies. The salivary gland protein repertoire from the Ae. aegypti mosquito was analyzed using a proteomic approach. One hundred and twenty proteins were identified in these salivary glands representing the largest description of the Ae. aegypti salivary gland protein catalog. We succeeded in identifying 15 secreted proteins, some of which have already been reported as being involved in blood feeding. A comparison of the proteins identified between the salivary glands and the sialome is discussed.

TI Molecular Survey of Enterocytozoon bieneusi in a Japanese Porcine
   Population
AB Enterocytozoon bieneusi is an emerging and clinically significant enteric human pathogen that is mainly associated with chronic diarrhea. It has been identified in a variety of wild, domestic, and companion mammals and birds. This pathogen is genetically diverse and is composed of over 80 host-specific and zoonotic genotypes. Pigs are considered one of the main reservoirs of this pathogen given its high reported prevalence in pigs, and pigs may harbor zoonotic and pig-specific genotypes. Therefore, genotyping of isolates from pigs and other animals is essential for the control of E. bieneusi infection. In Japan, it remains unclear whether this pathogen is present in the porcine population. In the present study, we examined 30 fecal samples from pigs reared on 6 farms in western Japan. Ten pigs (33%) were found to be positive when assessed by polymerase chain reaction. The genotypes were varied and were found to be animal specific (EbpA, H, PigEBITS5) and zoonotic (D, EbpC) in genotype. The observation that pigs in Japan appear to be infected with zoonotic and animal genotypes of E. bieneusi raises questions about the prevalence of this infection among the human population in Japan.

TI Sources of Error in the Estimation of Mosquito Infection Rates Used to
   Assess Risk of Arbovirus Transmission
AB Infection rate is an estimate of the prevalence of arbovirus infection in a mosquito population. It is assumed that when infection rate increases, the risk of arbovirus transmission to humans and animals also increases. We examined some of the factors that can invalidate this assumption. First, we used a model to illustrate how the proportion of mosquitoes capable of virus transmission, or infectious, is not a constant fraction of the number of infected mosquitoes. Thus, infection rate is not always a straightforward indicator of risk. Second, we used a model that simulated the process of mosquito sampling, pooling, and virus testing and found that mosquito infection rates commonly underestimate the prevalence of arbovirus infection in a mosquito population. Infection rate should always be used in conjunction with other surveillance indicators (mosquito population size, age structure, weather) and historical baseline data when assessing the risk of arbovirus transmission.

TI Temporal Connections between Culex tarsalis Abundance and Transmission
   of Western Equine Encephalomyelitis Virus in California
AB Definition of targets for vector control requires an understanding of the relationship between vector abundance and the intensity of arbovirus transmission. Using an extensive surveillance dataset with observations from sentinel chicken flocks and mosquito traps paired in time and space, hierarchical autoregressive logistic regression models were developed to predict the probability of seroconversion in chickens for western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV) based on the relative abundance of the principal vector, Culex tarsalis. After adjustments for confounders, the abundance of Cx. tarsalis 29-42 d before the date of chicken sampling was credibly associated with the risk of WEEV transmission in both the Central and Coachella Valleys, and a doubling of relative Cx. tarsalis abundance was associated with a 58% increase in the odds of seroconversion. The critical time windows identified in our study highlight the need for surveillance of vector populations and forecasting models to guide proactive vector control measures before the detection of transmission to sentinel chickens.

TI The Effect of Host Genetic Diversity on Disease Spread
AB Host genetic diversity is thought to reduce the likelihood that disease will spread in natural populations. In this study, I present an epidemiological model for the intrinsic rate of spread (R(0)) for an infectious disease. The results show that the average value for R(0) ((R) over bar (0)) is inversely related to the number of host genotypes in the population (G), assuming that each host genotype is susceptible to a different parasite genotype. Specifically, for large host populations, (R) over bar (0) is equal to B/G, where B is the number of infectious propagules produced by each infection that contact a different host. The results also suggest that virulent, single-strain infections, which initially spread in genetically diverse host populations, would quickly die out when the parasite depresses the frequency of susceptible hosts below 1/B. These results are consistent with empirical studies showing that genetically diverse host populations suffer less from pathogens and parasites.

TI Seeking a second opinion: uncertainty in disease ecology
AB Analytical methods accounting for imperfect detection are often used to facilitate reliable inference in population and community ecology. We contend that similar approaches are needed in disease ecology because these complicated systems are inherently difficult to observe without error. For example, wildlife disease studies often designate individuals, populations, or spatial units to states (e.g., susceptible, infected, post-infected), but the uncertainty associated with these state assignments remains largely ignored or unaccounted for. We demonstrate how recent developments incorporating observation error through repeated sampling extend quite naturally to hierarchical spatial models of disease effects, prevalence, and dynamics in natural systems. A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus in migratory waterfowl and a pathogenic fungus recently implicated in the global loss of amphibian biodiversity are used as motivating examples. Both show that relatively simple modifications to study designs can greatly improve our understanding of complex spatio-temporal disease dynamics by rigorously accounting for uncertainty at each level of the hierarchy.

However, the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, in the tick vector is nearly identical in the 2 regions. The disparity in human Lyme disease incidence may result from a disparity in the human invasiveness of the bacteria in the Northeast and Midwest caused by fundamentally different evolutionary histories. B. burgdorferi populations in the Northeast and Midwest are geographically isolated, enabling evolutionary divergence in human invasiveness. However, we found that B. burgdorferi populations in the Northeast and Midwest shared a recent common ancestor, which suggests that substantial evolutionary divergence in human invasiveness has not occurred. We propose that differences in either animal ecology or human behavior are the root cause of the differences in human incidence between the 2 regions.

TI ON THE EVOLUTION OF SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN HOSTS COEVOLVING WITH
   MULTIPLE PARASITES
AB Host-parasite coevolution has been studied extensively in the context of the evolution of sex. Although hosts typically coevolve with several parasites, most studies considered one-host/one-parasite interactions. Here, we study population-genetic models in which hosts interact with two parasites. We find that host/multiple-parasite models differ nontrivially from host/single-parasite models. Selection for sex resulting from interactions with a single parasite is often outweighed by detrimental effects due to the interaction between parasites if coinfection affects the host more severely than expected based on single infections, and/or if double infections are more common than expected based on single infections. The resulting selection against sex is caused by strong linkage-disequilibria of constant sign that arise between host loci interacting with different parasites. In contrast, if coinfection affects hosts less severely than expected and double infections are less common than expected, selection for sex due to interactions with individual parasites can now be reinforced by additional rapid linkage-disequilibrium oscillations with changing sign. Thus, our findings indicate that the presence of an additional parasite can strongly affect the evolution of sex in ways that cannot be predicted from single-parasite models, and that thus host/multiparasite models are an important extension of the Red Queen Hypothesis.

TI HOW DOES SPATIAL DISPERSAL NETWORK AFFECT THE EVOLUTION OF PARASITE
   LOCAL ADAPTATION?
AB Studying patterns of parasite local adaptation can provide insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of host-parasite coevolution. Many factors, both biotic and abiotic, have been identified that influence parasite local adaptation. In particular, dispersal and population structuring are considered important determinants of local adaptation. We investigated how the shape of the spatial dispersal network within experimental landscapes affected local adaptation of a bacteriophage parasite to its bacterial host. Regardless of landscape topology, dispersal always led to the evolution of phages with broader infectivity range. However, when the spatial dispersal network resulted in spatial variation in the breadth of phage infectivity range, significant levels of parasite local adaptation and local maladaptation were detected within the same landscape using the local versus foreign definition of local adaptation. By contrast, local adaptation was not detected using the home versus away or local versus global definitions of local adaptation. This suggests that spatial dispersal networks may play an important role in driving parasite local adaptation, particularly when the shape of the dispersal network generates nonuniform levels of host resistance or parasite infectivity throughout a species' range.

TI Response of circulating T-lymphocytes to a coccidian infection: insights
   from a parasitization-vaccination experiment
AB P>1. Knowledge of how pathogens activate different components of the immune system to combat infections in the wild is a first step towards building a more global picture of the role that immunocompetence plays in host-parasite evolution and host life history. Ecological immunology is currently situated in this first step due, in part, to the scarcity of simple techniques to reliably evaluate immunocompetence in the field. In fact, controversy remains as to whether parasites act as immuno-stimulators promoting immune responses or as immune-depressors via immune resource depletion.
   2. In this study we manipulated parasite infection (Caryospora, Protozoa, Apicomplexa) and vaccinated captive Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) to study potential immunological responses in different components of the immune system: circulating lymphocyte lineages (CD4, CD5 and CD8), counts of total lymphocytes and white blood cells (WBC) and plasma immunoglobulins (alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2 and delta).
   3. We also evaluated the efficacy of the PHA-assay, a common test used in ecological immunology, to gain information about T-cell-mediated immune response.
   4. Experimentally infected and vaccinated (inoculated with attenuated parasites) birds showed drastic increases in CD4 and CD5 lymphocyte lineages, but not in CD8s, nor in total counts of lymphocytes or WBCs and no significant variation was observed in plasma globulins and in inflammatory reaction to PHA as a consequence of infection. PHA assay values were not correlated with initial (before vaccination) or final (after vaccination) values or with the response (final - initial) of T-lymphocyte lineages.
   5. Individuals with initially lower numbers of CD4 showed higher numbers (higher immune response) after vaccination. In the case of CD5s, initial and final numbers were positively correlated.
   6. This study shows that parasites clearly provoke immune activity stimulation through proliferation of T-lymphocytes (CD4 and CD5) and also reveals that other commonly used measurements, considered to be related to T-cell-mediated immunity, such as single-time-point measurements (total lymphocyte and WBC counts) or PHA assays, have a questionable capacity to provide information about immunological capacity to combat pathogens.

TI Experimental evolution of local parasite maladaptation
AB Sign and magnitude of local adaptation in host-parasite systems may vary with ecological, epidemiological or genetic parameters. To investigate the role of host genetic background, we established long-term experimental populations of different genotypes of the protozoan Paramecium caudatum, infected with the bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. We observed the evolution of an overall pattern of parasite local maladaptation for infectivity, indicating a general coevolutionary disadvantage of this parasite. Maladaptation extended to host populations with the same genetic background, similar to extending from the local to a higher regional level in natural populations. Patterns for virulence were qualitatively similar, but with less statistical support. A nonsignificant correlation with levels of (mal)adaptation for infectivity suggests independent evolution of these traits. Our results indicate similar (co)evolutionary trajectories in populations with different genetic backgrounds. Nonetheless, the correlated clines of genetic distance and parasite performance illustrate how genetic background can shape spatial gradients of local adaptation.

TI End Points for Testing Influenza Antiviral Treatments for Patients at
   High Risk of Severe and Life-Threatening Disease
AB Influenza infection results in substantial morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, including those who are immuno-compromised or pregnant. Antiviral therapy likely provides considerable benefit to these patients, but few studies have been successfully conducted in these high-risk populations, and no drugs are specifically licensed for treating these subgroups. One of the key challenges facing novel antiviral drug development for influenza is determining the appropriate efficacy end points that would enable rapid regulatory approval for drug use in seriously ill patients, for whom risk-benefit assessments differ from those with uncomplicated illness. All available antiviral drugs currently affect viral replication, and respiratory tract viral titers correlate with both symptoms and measures of host inflammatory responses, including cytokine and chemokine expression that are likely responsible for many of the clinical symptoms. Consequently, we outline the evidence to support the use of primary virological end points in studies of antiviral agents involving patients who are hospitalized with severe influenza or those who are at high risk of severe and life-threatening disease.

TI A Substantial Transmission Bottleneck among Newly and Recently
   HIV-1-Infected Injection Drug Users in St Petersburg, Russia
AB There are limited data on the genetic complexity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) after transmission among a cohort of injection drug users (IDUs). We used single-genome amplification of HIV-1 env to determine the genotypic characteristics of virus among IDUs with acute infection in St Petersburg, Russia. Our results indicate that a single variant was transmitted in a majority of cases (9 of 13 participants), which is analogous to what is observed in sexual transmission. These data are most consistent with a genetic bottleneck during transmission by injection drug use that is due to a small inoculum, which most often results in the transmission of a low-complexity viral population.

TI Identification of Hot Spots of Malaria Transmission for Targeted Malaria
   Control
AB Background. Variation in the risk of malaria within populations is a frequently described but poorly understood phenomenon. This heterogeneity creates opportunities for targeted interventions but only if hot spots of malaria transmission can be easily identified.
   Methods. We determined spatial patterns in malaria transmission in a district in northeastern Tanzania, using malaria incidence data from a cohort study involving infants and household-level mosquito sampling data. The parasite prevalence rates and age-specific seroconversion rates (SCRs) of antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum antigens were determined in samples obtained from people attending health care facilities.
   Results. Five clusters of higher malaria incidence were detected and interpreted as hot spots of transmission. These hot spots partially overlapped with clusters of higher mosquito exposure but could not be satisfactorily predicted by a probability model based on environmental factors. Small-scale local variation in malaria exposure was detected by parasite prevalence rates and SCR estimates for samples of health care facility attendees. SCR estimates were strongly associated with local malaria incidence rates and predicted hot spots of malaria transmission with 95% sensitivity and 85% specificity.
   Conclusions. Serological markers were able to detect spatial variation in malaria transmission at the micro-epidemiological level, and they have the potential to form an effective method for spatial targeting of malaria control efforts.

TI Molecular diagnostics for sleeping sickness: what is the benefit for the
   patient?
AB Sleeping sickness, or human African trypanosomiasis, is a vector-borne disease caused by two subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, and is geographically restricted to sub-Saharan Africa. Although the disease causes major public-health and socioeconomic problems among affected populations, sleeping sickness is one of the world's most neglected diseases. Within the rapidly evolving field of biotechnology, many molecular diagnostics have been developed to detect the parasite. These range from conventional, high-tech, and low-tech PCR formats (eg, isothermal nucleic-acid-amplification techniques), to direct visualisation of the parasite's nucleic acids by fluorescent probes. Besides reviewing the most important molecular diagnostics available, we discuss their current role in diagnosis and disease control. Although powerful, molecular diagnostics are confined to research settings and do not reach the patient or national control programmes. The current formats are not applicable to field conditions, and simplification, standardisation, and proper test evaluation in the target setting should be the main focus for future development.

   rodents in Asia contrasts with low levels of genomic divergence in
   Northern Europe and America
AB Bartonella is a genus of vector-borne bacteria that infect the red blood cells of mammals, and includes several human-specific and zoonotic pathogens. Bartonella grahamii has a wide host range and is one of the most prevalent Bartonella species in wild rodents. We studied the population structure, genome content and genome plasticity of a collection of 26 B. grahamii isolates from 11 species of wild rodents in seven countries. We found strong geographic patterns, high recombination frequencies and large variations in genome size in B. grahamii compared with previously analysed cat- and human-associated Bartonella species. The extent of sequence divergence in B. grahamii populations was markedly lower in Europe and North America than in Asia, and several recombination events were predicted between the Asian strains. We discuss environmental and demographic factors that may underlie the observed differences.

TI Gene Expression Patterns of Dengue Virus-Infected Children from
   Nicaragua Reveal a Distinct Signature of Increased Metabolism
AB Background: Infection with dengue viruses (DENV) leads to a spectrum of disease outcomes. The pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of DENV infection may be driven by host responses, which could be reflected in the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted genome-wide microarray analysis of whole blood RNA from 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua collected on days 3-6 of illness, with different disease manifestations. Gene expression analysis identified genes that are differentially regulated between clinical subgroups. The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between dengue patients with and without shock, especially in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In the dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, one subset of differentially expressed genes encode neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. By performing a meta-analysis of our dataset in conjunction with previously published datasets, we confirmed that DENV infection in vivo is associated with large changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Additionally, whereas in vitro infection leads to an increased interferon signature, this was not consistently observed from in vivo patient samples, suggesting that the interferon response in vivo is relatively transient and was no longer observed by days 3-6 of illness.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data highlight important differences between different manifestations of severity during DENV infection as well as identify some commonalities. Compilation of larger datasets in the future across multiple studies, as we have initiated in this report, may well lead to better prediction of disease manifestation via a systems biology approach.

TI Landscape Predictors of Tick-Borne Encephalitis in Latvia: Land Cover,
   Land Use, and Land Ownership
AB Although the presence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus circulating in tick populations depends on large-scale patterns of climate, and the local density of infected ticks depends on the abundance of mammalian hosts, the risk of human infection depends on the access and use by human populations of tick-infested habitats, particularly forests, at the landscape level. We investigated the incidence of reported TBE cases in rural parishes (i.e., municipalities) in Latvia. The following major characteristics of parishes were considered: whether their environment is suitable for tick and tick-host populations (depending on land cover); whether the local human population is likely to enter the forest on a regular base (depending on land use); and whether the spatial distributions of these two aspects are likely to intersect, through access rules (as a function of land ownership). The results indicated that all three aspects are important in explaining and predicting the spatial distribution of TBE cases in the rural areas of Latvia. The concept of landscape is here given new depth by consideration of its physical structure, its use by human populations, and its accessibility as modulated by ownership.

TI Identification of Environmental Covariates of West Nile Virus Vector
   Mosquito Population Abundance
AB The rapid spread of West Nile virus (WNv) in North America is a major public health concern. Culex pipiens-restuans is the principle mosquito vector of WNv in the northeastern United States while Aedes vexans is an important bridge vector of the virus in this region. Vector mosquito abundance is directly dependent on physical environmental factors that provide mosquito habitats. The objective of this research is to determine landscape elements that explain the population abundance and distribution of WNv vector mosquitoes using stepwise linear regression. We developed a novel approach for examining a large set of landscape variables based on a land use and land cover classification by selecting variables in stages to minimize multicollinearity. We also investigated the distance at which landscape elements influence abundance of vector populations using buffer distances of 200, 400, and 1000 m. Results show landscape effects have a significant impact on Cx. pipiens-estuans population distribution while the effects of landscape features are less important for prediction of Ae. vexans population distributions. Cx. pipiens-restuans population abundance is positively correlated with human population density, housing unit density, and urban land use and land cover classes and negatively correlated with age of dwellings and amount of forested land.

TI Role Played by CD4(+)FOXP3(+) Regulatory T Cells in Suppression of Host
   Responses to Haemophilus ducreyi during Experimental Infection of Human
   Volunteers
AB Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, a genital ulcer disease. Among human volunteers, the majority of experimentally infected individuals fail to clear the infection and form pustules. Here, we investigated the role played by CD4(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T (T-reg) cells in the formation of pustules. In pustules, there was a significant enrichment of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells, compared with that in peripheral blood. The majority of lesional FOXP3(+) T cells were CD4(+), CD25(+), CD127(lo/-), and CTLA-4(+). FOXP3(+) T cells were found throughout pustules but were most abundant at their base. Significantly fewer lesional CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells expressed interferon gamma, compared with lesional CD4(+)FOXP3(-) effector T cells. Depletion of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells from the peripheral blood of infected and uninfected volunteers significantly enhanced proliferation of H. ducreyi-reactive CD4(+) T cells. Our results indicate that the population of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo/-)FOXP3(+) T-reg cells are expanded at H. ducreyi-infected sites and that these cells may play a role in suppressing the host immune response to the bacterium.

TI How Stable Is the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)? Environmental Stability of
   HCV and Its Susceptibility to Chemical Biocides
AB Background. In the absence of a cell culture system for propagation of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the antiviral activity of disinfectants against HCV was extrapolated from studies with the bovine viral diarrhea virus. The recent development of an HCV infection system allowed the direct assessment of environmental stability and susceptibility to chemical disinfectants.
   Methods. Studies were performed using cell-culture grown HCV. Infectivity was determined by limiting dilutions. HCV RNA levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Genome stability was determined by transfection of recovered RNA into Huh7.5 cells and immunostaining.
   Results. HCV infectivity in a liquid environment was detectable for up to 5 month at lower temperatures. The risk of HCV infections may not accurately be reflected by determination of HCV RNA levels, because viral infectivity and HCV RNA copy numbers did not directly correlate. Different alcohols and commercially available antiseptics reduced the infectivity of HCV to undetectable levels. However, diluting the hand disinfectants abrogated the virucidal activity.
   Conclusions. This study assessed the environmental stability and susceptibility to chemical biocides of HCV. The results should be useful in defining rigorous disinfection protocols to prevent nosocomial transmission of HCV.

AB The transmission dynamics of influenza in tropical regions are poorly understood. Here we explore geographical variations in the reproduction number of influenza across equatorial, tropical and subtropical areas of Brazil, based on the analysis of weekly pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality time series in 27 states. The reproduction number (R) was low on average in Brazil (mean = 1.03 (95% CI 1.02-1.04), assuming a serial interval of 3 days). Estimates of the reproduction number were slightly lower for Brazil than for the USA or France (difference in mean R = 0.08, p < 0.01) and displayed less between-year variation (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest a weak gradient in the reproduction number with population size, where R increases from low population in the North to high population in the South of Brazil. Our low estimates of the reproduction number suggest that influenza population immunity could be high on average in Brazil, potentially resulting in increased viral genetic diversity and rate of emergence of new variants. Additional epidemiological and genetic studies are warranted to further characterize the dynamics of influenza in the tropics and refine our understanding of the global circulation of influenza viruses.

TI Parasite virulence when the infection reduces the host immune response
AB Parasite infections often induce a reduction in host immune response either because of a direct manipulation of the immune system by the parasite or because of energy depletion. Although infection-induced immunodepression can favour the establishment of the parasite within the host, a too severe immunodepression may increase the risk of infection with opportunistic pathogens, stopping the period over which the parasite can be transmitted to other hosts. Here, we explore how the risk of contracting opportunistic diseases affects the survival of the amphipod Gammarus pulex infected by the acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis. Previous work with this system has shown that upon infection, G. pulex has a substantially reduced immune response. Non-infected and P. laevis-infected hosts were maintained either in control or in micro-organism-enriched water, so as to vary the risk of encountering opportunistic pathogens. As predicted, we found that host mortality was exacerbated when infected gammarids were maintained in micro-organism-enriched water compared with clean, control water; whereas for noninfected gammarids, living in micro-organism-enriched water only moderately increased the risk of mortality. These results show that the virulence of parasites that reduce the host immune response is an environmentally sensitive trait that depends on the concomitant risk for the host of contracting opportunistic diseases. This extra source of host mortality probably represents a cost for P. laevis, and we tentatively predict that the optimal level of parasite exploitation should depend on environmental conditions.

MSM in Peru constitute a target population for further HBV preventive and treatment interventions.

TI The Evolution of Host-Parasite Range
AB Understanding the coevolution of hosts and parasites is one of the key challenges for evolutionary biology. In particular, it is important to understand the processes that generate and maintain variation. Here, we examine a coevolutionary model of hosts and parasites where infection does not depend on absolute rates of transmission and defense but is approximately all-or-nothing, depending on the relative levels of defense and infectivity of the host and the parasite. We show that considerable diversity can be generated and maintained because of epidemiological feedbacks, with strains differing in the range of host and parasite types they can respectively infect or resist. Parasites with broad and narrow ranges therefore coexist, as do broadly and narrowly resistant hosts, but this diversity occurs without the assumption of highly specific gene interactions. In contrast to gene-for-gene models, cycling in strain types is found only under a restrictive set of circumstances. The generation of diversity in both hosts and parasites is dependent on the shape of the trade-off relationships but is more likely in long-lived hosts and chronic disease with long infectious periods. Overall, our model shows that significant diversity in infectivity and resistance range can evolve and be maintained from initially monomorphic populations.

TI Persistence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in Natural
   Ecosystems
AB Understanding of ecologic factors favoring emergence and maintenance of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses is limited. Although low pathogenic avian influenza viruses persist and evolve in wild populations, HPAI viruses evolve in domestic birds and cause economically serious epizootics that only occasionally infect wild populations. We propose that evolutionary ecology considerations can explain this apparent paradox. Host structure and transmission possibilities differ considerably between wild and domestic birds and are likely to be major determinants of virulence. Because viral fitness is highly dependent on host survival and dispersal in nature, virulent forms are unlikely to persist in wild populations if they kill hosts quickly or affect predation risk or migratory performance. Interhost transmission in water has evolved in low pathogenic influenza viruses in wild waterfowl populations. However, oropharyngeal shedding and transmission by aerosols appear more efficient for HPAI viruses among domestic birds.

TI Climate Variability and Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome
   Transmission in Northeastern China
AB BACKGROUND: The transmission of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is influenced by climatic variables. However, few studies have examined the quantitative relationship between climate variation and HFRS transmission.
   OBJECTIVE: We examined the potential impact of climate variability on HFRS transmission and developed climate-based forecasting models for HFRS in northeastern China.
   METHODS: We obtained data on monthly counts of reported HFRS cases in Elunchun and Molidawahaner counties for 1997-2007 from the Inner Mongolia Center for Disease Control and Prevention and climate data from the Chinese Bureau of Meteorology. Cross-correlations assessed crude associations between climate variables, including rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), relative humidity (RH), and the multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index (MEI) and monthly HFRS cases over a range of lags. We used time-series Poisson regression models to examine the independent contribution of climatic variables to HFRS transmission.
   RESULTS: Cross-correlation analyses showed that rainfall, LST, RH, and MEI were significantly associated with monthly HFRS cases with lags of 3-5 months in both study areas. The results of Poisson regression indicated that after controlling for the autocorrelation, seasonality, and long-term trend, rainfall, LST, RH, and MEI with lags of 3-5 months were associated with HFRS in both study areas. The final model had good accuracy in forecasting the occurrence of HFRS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Climate variability plays a significant role in HFRS transmission in northeastern China. The model developed in this study has implications for HFRS control and prevention.

TI Epidemiology of squirrelpox virus in grey squirrels in the UK
AB The dramatic decline of the native red squirrel in the UK has been attributed to both direct and disease-mediated competition with the grey squirrel where the competitor acts as a reservoir host of squirrelpox virus (SQPV). SQPV is threatening red squirrel conservation efforts, yet little is known about its epidemiology. We analysed seroprevalence of antibody against SQPV in grey squirrels from northern England and the Scottish Borders in relation to season, weather, sex, and body weight using Generalized Linear Models in conjunction with Structural Equation Modelling. Results indicated a heterogeneous prevalence pattern which is male-biased, increases with weight and varies seasonally. Seroprevalence rose during the autumn and peaked in spring. Weather parameters had an indirect effect on SQPV antibody status. Our findings point towards a direct disease transmission route, which includes environmental contamination. Red squirrel conservation management options should therefore seek to minimize squirrel contact points.

We ran different univariate models, each encompassing a different lag period for the effects of haze and temperature (from lag 0 to lag 12 weeks). We analysed the data on a natural logarithmic scale to stabilize the variance and improve the estimation. No association between dengue activity and haze was found. Our findings do not lend support to the hypothesis that haze is associated with reduced dengue activity in Singapore.

TI TEMPORAL VARIATION AT THE MHC CLASS IIB IN WILD POPULATIONS OF THE GUPPY
   (POECILIA RETICULATA)
AB Understanding genetic diversity in natural populations is a fundamental objective of evolutionary biology. The immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are excellent candidates to study such diversity because they are highly polymorphic in populations. Although balancing selection may be responsible for maintaining diversity at these functionally important loci, temporal variation in selection pressure has rarely been examined. We examine temporal variation in MHC class IIB diversity in nine guppy (Poecilia reticulata) populations over two years. We found that five of the populations changed significantly more at the MHC than at neutral (microsatellite) loci as measured by F(ST), which suggests that the change at the MHC was due to selection and not neutral processes. Additionally, pairwise population differentiation measures at the MHC were higher in 2007 than in 2006, with the signature of selection changing from homogenizing to diversifying selection or neutral evolution. Interestingly, within the populations the magnitude of the change at the MHC between years was related to the change in the proportion of individuals infected by a common parasite, indicating a link between genetic structure and the parasite. Our data thereby implicate temporal variation in selective pressure as an important mechanism maintaining diversity at the MHC in wild populations.

TI HOST GROWTH CONDITIONS INFLUENCE EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION OF LIFE HISTORY
   AND VIRULENCE OF A PARASITE WITH VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL TRANSMISSION
AB In parasites with mixed modes of transmission, ecological conditions may determine the relative importance of vertical and horizontal transmission for parasite fitness. This may lead to differential selection pressure on the efficiency of the two modes of transmission and on parasite virulence. In populations with high birth rates, increased opportunities for vertical transmission may select for higher vertical transmissibility and possibly lower virulence. We tested this idea in experimental populations of the protozoan Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Serial dilution produced constant host population growth and frequent vertical transmission. Consistent with predictions, evolved parasites from this "high-growth" treatment had higher fidelity of vertical transmission and lower virulence than parasites from host populations constantly kept near their carrying capacity ("low-growth treatment"). High-growth parasites also produced fewer, but more infectious horizontal transmission stages, suggesting the compensation of trade-offs between vertical and horizontal transmission components in this treatment. These results illustrate how environmentally driven changes in host demography can promote evolutionary divergence of parasite life history and transmission strategies.

TI Nestedness versus modularity in ecological networks: two sides of the
   same coin?
AB P>1. Understanding the structure of ecological networks is a crucial task for interpreting community and ecosystem responses to global change.
   2. Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns.
   3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant-animal mutualistic and host-parasite networks.
   4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities.
   5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it.
   6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities.

TI Host behaviour and exposure risk in an insect-pathogen interaction
AB P>1. Studies of variability in host resistance to disease generally emphasize variability in susceptibility given exposure, neglecting the possibility that hosts may vary in behaviours that affect the risk of exposure.
   2. In many insects, horizontal transmission of baculoviruses occurs when larvae consume foliage contaminated by the cadavers of virus-infected conspecific larvae; so, host behaviour may have a strong effect on the risk of infection.
   3. We studied variability in the behaviour of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larvae, which are able to detect and avoid virus-contaminated foliage.
   4. Our results show that detection ability can be affected by the family line that larvae originate from, even at some distance from a virus-infected cadaver, and suggest that cadaver-detection ability may be heritable.
   5. There is thus the potential for natural selection to act on cadaver-detection ability, and thereby to affect the dynamics of pathogen-driven cycles in gypsy moth populations.
   6. We argue that host behaviour is a neglected component in studies of variability in disease resistance.

TI Host-parasite coevolution: genetic variation in a virus population and
   the interaction with a host gene
AB Host-parasite coevolution is considered to be an important factor in maintaining genetic variation in resistance to pathogens. Drosophila melanogaster is naturally infected by the sigma virus, a vertically transmitted and host-specific pathogen. In fly populations, there is a large amount of genetic variation in the transmission rate from parent to offspring, much of which is caused by major-effect resistance polymorphisms. We have found that there are similarly high levels of genetic variation in the rate of paternal transmission among 95 different isolates of the virus as in the host. However, when we examined a transmission-blocking gene in the host, we found that it was effective across virus isolates. Therefore, the high levels of genetic variation observed in this system do not appear to be maintained because of coevolution resulting from interactions between this host gene and parasite genes.

TI An epidemiological model of host-parasite coevolution and sex
AB The Red Queen hypothesis posits a promising way to explain the widespread existence of sexual reproduction despite the cost of producing males. The essence of the hypothesis is that coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites select for the genetic diversification of offspring via cross-fertilization. Here, I relax a common assumption of many Red Queen models that each host is exposed to one parasite. Instead, I assume that the number of propagules encountered by each host depends on the number of infected hosts in the previous generation, which leads to additional complexities. The results suggest that epidemiological feedbacks, combined with frequency-dependent selection, could lead to the long-term persistence of sex under biologically reasonable conditions.

TI Arabinosylated Lipoarabinomannan-Mediated Protection in Visceral
   Leishmaniasis through Up-Regulation of Toll-Like Receptor 2 Signaling:
   An Immunoprophylactic Approach
AB Visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by severe immunosuppression of the host cell, resulting in loss of the proinflammatory response. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is involved in myriad disease forms, including visceral leishmaniasis. During Leishmania donovani infection, the parasite modulates TLR2 to suppress interleukin 12 production, indicating the possible involvement of TLR2 in regulation of the immune response against L. donovani infection. Arabinosylated lipoarabinomannan (Ara-LAM) possesses immunomodulatory properties and induces proinflammatory responses via induction of TLR2-mediated signaling. Here, we found that pretreatment of L. donovani-infected macrophages with Ara-LAM caused a significant increase in TLR2 expression along with the activation of TLR2-mediated downstream signaling, facilitating active nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B. These events culminated in up-regulation of the proinflammatory response, which was abrogated by treatment with TLR2-specific small interfering RNA. In vivo experiments were also suggestive of Ara-LAM playing a long-term protective role. This study demonstrates that Ara-LAM confers protection against leishmanial pathogenesis via TLR2 signaling-mediated induction of the proinflammatory response.

TI Effect of treating co-infections on HIV-1 viral load: a systematic
   review
AB Co-infections contribute to HIV-related pathogenesis and often increase viral load in HIV-infected people. We did a systematic review to assess the effect of treating key co-infections on plasma HIV-1-RNA concentrations in low-income countries. We identified 18 eligible studies for review: two on tuberculosis, two on malaria, six on helminths, and eight on sexually transmitted infections, excluding untreatable or non-pathogenic infections. Standardised mean plasma viral load decreased after the treatment of co-infecting pathogens in all 18 studies. The standardised mean HIV viral-load difference ranged from -0.04 log(10) copies per mL (95% CI -0.24 to 0.16) after syphilis treatment to -3.47 log(10) copies per mL (95% CI -3-78 to -3.16) after tuberculosis treatment. of 14 studies with variance data available, 12 reported significant HIV viral-load differences before and after treatment. Although many of the viral-load reductions were 1.0 log(10) copies per mL or less, even small changes in plasma HIV-RNA concentrations have been shown to slow HIV progression and could translate into population-level benefits in lowering HIV transmission risk.

TI Central Asia: hotspot in the worldwide HIV epidemic
AB The HIV epidemic in central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) has accelerated since 2000. This expansion in the epidemic is largely attributable to escalating injection drug use, reflecting central Asia's geographic position along major drug trafficking routes. Although up to 75% of cumulative HIV cases have been among injection drug users (IDUs) so far, HIV infections are increasing in other population groups, including female sex workers and their clients, prisoners, and migrants. Among IDUs, risky injecting practices are highly prevalent, and the intersecting epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, particularly syphilis, highlights the potential for sexual transmission of HIV to bridging populations. Few HIV cases in children have been reported so far, with most resulting from nosocomial outbreaks in hospital settings. Some recent progress has been made towards scaling-up prevention, treatment, and care services, including harm reduction for IDUs, although key challenges remain.

TI Cryptic diversity and patterns of host specificity in trematode
   flatworms
AB The widespread utilization of molecular markers has revealed that a broad spectrum of taxa contain sets of morphologically cryptic, but genetically distinct lineages (< link rid="b1"> Bickford et al. 2007). The identification of cryptic taxa is important as an accurate appreciation of diversity is crucial for a proper understanding of evolutionary and ecological processes. An example is the study of host specificity in parasitic taxa, where an apparent generalist may be found to contain a complex of several more specific species (< link rid="b11"> Smith et al. 2006). Host specificity is a key life history trait that varies greatly among parasites (< link rid="b9"> Poulin & Keeney 2007). While some can exploit a wide range of hosts, others are confined to just a single species. Access to additional hosts increases the resources available to a parasite. However, physiological or ecological constraints can restrict the extension of host range. Furthermore, there may be a trade-off between relaxed specificity and performance: generalism can decrease a parasites ability to adapt to each individual host species, and increase exposure to competition from other parasites (< link rid="b8"> Poulin 1998). Despite the central role that host specificity plays in parasite life history, relatively little is known about how host range is determined in natural systems, and data from field studies are required to evaluate among competing ideas. In this issue, an exciting paper by < link rid="b5"> Locke et al. (2010) makes a valuable contribution toward the understanding of host specificity in an important group of trematode flatworms. Using molecular methods, Locke et al. reveal an almost four-fold increase in the appreciated diversity of their focal group. In combination with a large and elegant sampling design this allows them to accurately assess host specificity for each taxon, and thus draw key insights into the factors that control host range in a dominant parasite group.

TI Contrasting landscape epidemiology of two sympatric rabies virus strains
AB Viral strain evolution and disease emergence are influenced by anthropogenic change to the environment. We investigated viral characteristics, host ecology, and landscape features in the rabies-striped skunk disease system of the central Great Plains to determine how these factors interact to influence disease emergence. We amplified portions of the N and G genes of rabies viral RNA from 269 samples extracted from striped skunk brains throughout the distribution of two different rabies strains for which striped skunks were the reservoir. Because the distribution of these two strains overlapped on the landscape and were present in the same host population, we could evaluate how viral properties influenced epidemiological patterns in the area of sympatry. We found that South Central Skunk rabies (SCSK) exhibited intense purifying selection and high infectivity, which are both characteristics of an epizootic virus. Conversely, North Central Skunk rabies (NCSK) exhibited relaxed purifying selection and comparatively lower infectivity, suggesting the presence of an enzootic virus. The host population in the area of sympatry was highly admixed, and skunks among allopatric and sympatric areas had similar effective population sizes. Spatial analysis indicated that landscape features had minimal influence on NCSK movement across the landscape, but those same features were partial barriers to the spread of SCSK. We conclude that NCSK and SCSK have different epidemiological properties that interact differently with both host and landscape features to influence rabies spread in the central Great Plains. We suggest a holistic approach for future studies of emerging infectious diseases that includes studies of viral properties, host characteristics, and spatial features.

TI Mites as biological tags of their hosts
AB Movements and spatial distribution of host populations are expected to shape the genetic structure of their parasite populations. Comparing the genetic patterns of both interacting species may improve our understanding of their evolutionary history. Moreover, genetic analyses of parasites with horizontal transmission may serve as indicators of historical events or current demographic processes that are not apparent in the genetic signature of their hosts. Here, we compared mitochondrial variation in populations of the ectoparasitic mite Spinturnix myoti with the genetic pattern of its host, the Maghrebian bat Myotis punicus in North Africa and in the islands of Corsica and Sardinia. Mite mitochondrial differentiation among populations was correlated with both host mitochondrial and nuclear differentiation, suggesting spatial co-differentiation of the lineages of the two interacting species. Therefore our results suggest that parasite dispersal is exclusively mediated by host movements, with open water between landmasses as a main barrier for host and parasite dispersal. Surprisingly the unique presence of a continental European mite lineage in Corsica was inconsistent with host phylogeographical history and strongly suggests the former presence of European mouse-eared bats on this island. Parasites may thus act as biological tags to reveal the presence of their now locally extinct host.

TI Prevalence of a virus inducing behavioural manipulation near species
   range border
AB The densities of conspecific individuals may vary through space, especially at the edge of species range. This variation in density is predicted to influence the diffusion of species-specific horizontally transmitted symbionts. However, to date there is very little data on how parasite prevalence varies around the border of a host species. Using a molecular epidemiology approach, we studied the prevalence of a vertically and horizontally transmitted virus at the edge of the geographic range of its insect host, the Drosophila parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. L. boulardi is a Mediterranean parasitoid species showing a recent range expansion to the north (in France). The LbFV virus manipulates the behaviour of females, increasing their tendency to lay additional eggs in already parasitized Drosophila larvae (superparasitism). This is beneficial for the virus because it allows the virus to be horizontally transferred during superparasitism. We show that LbFV prevalence is very high in central populations, intermediate in marginal populations and almost absent from newly established peripheral populations of L. boulardi. We failed to detect any influence of temperature and diapause on viral transmission efficiency but we observed a clear relationship between prevalence and parasitoid density, and between parasitoid density and the occurrence of superparasitism, as predicted by our epidemiological model. Viral strains were all efficient at inducing the behavioural manipulation and viral gene sequencing revealed very low sequence variation. We conclude that the prevalence reached by the virus critically depends on density-dependent factors, i.e. superparasitism, underlying the selective pressures acting on the virus to manipulate the behaviour of the parasitoid.

TI Antiangiogenic and Antitumor Effects of Trypanosoma cruzi Calreticulin
AB Background: In Latin America, 18 million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas' disease, with the greatest economic burden. Vertebrate calreticulins (CRT) are multifunctional, intra-and extracellular proteins. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) they bind calcium and act as chaperones. Since human CRT (HuCRT) is antiangiogenic and suppresses tumor growth, the presence of these functions in the parasite orthologue may have consequences in the host/parasite interaction. Previously, we have cloned and expressed T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) and shown that TcCRT, translocated from the ER to the area of trypomastigote flagellum emergence, promotes infectivity, inactivates the complement system and inhibits angiogenesis in the chorioallantoid chicken egg membrane. Most likely, derived from these properties, TcCRT displays in vivo inhibitory effects against an experimental mammary tumor.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: TcCRT (or its N-terminal vasostatin-like domain, N-TcCRT) a) Abrogates capillary growth in the ex vivo rat aortic ring assay, b) Inhibits capillary morphogenesis in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) assay, c) Inhibits migration and proliferation of HUVECs and the human endothelial cell line Eahy926. In these assays TcCRT was more effective, in molar terms, than HuCRT: d) In confocal microscopy, live HUVECs and EAhy926 cells, are recognized by FITC-TcCRT, followed by its internalization and accumulation around the host cell nuclei, a phenomenon that is abrogated by Fucoidin, a specific scavenger receptor ligand and, e) Inhibits in vivo the growth of the murine mammary TA3 MTXR tumor cell line.
   Conclusions/Significance: We describe herein antiangiogenic and antitumor properties of a parasite chaperone molecule, specifically TcCRT. Perhaps, by virtue of its capacity to inhibit angiogenesis (and the complement system), TcCRT is anti-inflammatory, thus impairing the antiparasite immune response. The TcCRT antiangiogenic effect could also explain, at least partially, the in vivo antitumor effects reported herein and the reports proposing antitumor properties for T. cruzi infection.

TI A Virulent Wolbachia Infection Decreases the Viability of the Dengue
   Vector Aedes aegypti during Periods of Embryonic Quiescence
AB A new approach for dengue control has been proposed that relies on life-shortening strains of the obligate intracellular bacterium Wolbachia pipientis to modify mosquito population age structure and reduce pathogen transmission. Previously we reported the stable transinfection of the major dengue vector Aedes aegypti with a life-shortening Wolbachia strain (wMelPop-CLA) from the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we report a further characterization of the phenotypic effects of this virulent Wolbachia infection on several life-history traits of Ae. aegypti. Minor costs of wMelPop-CLA infection for pre-imaginal survivorship, development and adult size were found. However, we discovered that the wMelPop-CLA infection dramatically decreased the viability of desiccated Ae. aegypti eggs over time. Similarly, the reproductive fitness of wMelPop-CLA infected Ae. aegypti females declined with age. These results reveal a general pattern associated with wMelPop-CLA induced pathogenesis in this mosquito species, where host fitness costs increase during aging of both immature and adult life-history stages. In addition to influencing the invasion dynamics of this particular Wolbachia strain, we suggest that the negative impact of wMelPop-CLA on embryonic quiescence may have applied utility as a tool to reduce mosquito population size in regions with pronounced dry seasons or in regions that experience cool winters.

TI Rift Valley Fever Virus Seroprevalence in Human Rural Populations of
   Gabon
AB Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis caused by a phlebovirus and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Humans can also be infected through direct contact with blood (aerosols) or tissues (placenta, stillborn) of infected animals. Although severe clinical cases can be observed, infection with RVF virus (RVFV) in humans is, in most cases, asymptomatic or causes a febrile illness without serious symptoms. In small ruminants RVFV mainly causes abortion and neonatal death. The distribution of RVFV has been well documented in many African countries, particularly in the north (Egypt, Sudan), east (Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia), west (Senegal, Mauritania) and south (South Africa), but also in the Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mayotte) and the Arabian Peninsula. In contrast, the prevalence of RVFV has rarely been investigated in central African countries.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We therefore conducted a large serological survey of rural populations in Gabon, involving 4,323 individuals from 212 randomly selected villages (10.3% of all Gabonese villages). RVFV-specific IgG was found in a total of 145 individuals (3.3%) suggesting the wide circulation of Rift Valley fever virus in Gabon. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in the lakes region than in forest and savannas zones, with respective rates of 8.3%, 2.9% and 2.2%. In the lakes region, RVFV-specific IgG was significantly more prevalent in males than in females (respectively 12.8% and 3.8%) and the seroprevalence increased gradually with age in males but not in females.
   Conclusions/Significance: Although RVFV was suggested to circulate at a relatively high level in Gabon, no outbreaks or even isolated cases have been documented in the country. The higher prevalence in the lakes region is likely to be driven by specific ecologic conditions favorable to certain mosquito vector species. Males may be more at risk of infection than females because they spend more time farming and hunting outside the villages, where they may be more exposed to mosquito bites and infected animals. Further investigations are needed to determine the putative sylvan cycle of RVFV, including the mosquito species and the reservoir role of wild animals in the viral maintenance cycle.

TI Phylogeography of Recently Emerged DENV-2 in Southern Viet Nam
AB Revealing the dispersal of dengue viruses (DENV) in time and space is central to understanding their epidemiology. However, the processes that shape DENV transmission patterns at the scale of local populations are not well understood, particularly the impact of such factors as human population movement and urbanization. Herein, we investigated trends in the spatial dynamics of DENV-2 transmission in the highly endemic setting of southern Viet Nam. Through a phylogeographic analysis of 168 full-length DENV-2 genome sequences obtained from hospitalized dengue cases from 10 provinces in southern Viet Nam, we reveal substantial genetic diversity in both urban and rural areas, with multiple lineages identified in individual provinces within a single season, and indicative of frequent viral migration among communities. Focusing on the recently introduced Asian I genotype, we observed particularly high rates of viral exchange between adjacent geographic areas, and between Ho Chi Minh City, the primary urban center of this region, and populations across southern Viet Nam. Within Ho Chi Minh City, patterns of DENV movement appear consistent with a gravity model of virus dispersal, with viruses traveling across a gradient of population density. Overall, our analysis suggests that Ho Chi Minh City may act as a source population for the dispersal of DENV across southern Viet Nam, and provides further evidence that urban areas of Southeast Asia play a primary role in DENV transmission. However, these data also indicate that more rural areas are also capable of maintaining virus populations and hence fueling DENV evolution over multiple seasons.

TI Acellular pertussis vaccination facilitates Bordetella parapertussis
   infection in a rodent model of bordetellosis
AB Despite over 50 years of population-wide vaccination, whooping cough incidence is on the rise. Although Bordetella pertussis is considered the main causative agent of whooping cough in humans, Bordetella parapertussis infections are not uncommon. The widely used acellular whooping cough vaccines (aP) are comprised solely of B. pertussis antigens that hold little or no efficacy against B. parapertussis. Here, we ask how aP vaccination affects competitive interactions between Bordetella species within co-infected rodent hosts and thus the aP-driven strength and direction of in-host selection. We show that aP vaccination helped clear B. pertussis but resulted in an approximately 40-fold increase in B. parapertussis lung colony-forming units (CFUs). Such vaccine-mediated facilitation of B. parapertussis did not arise as a result of competitive release; B. parapertussis CFUs were higher in aP-relative to sham-vaccinated hosts regardless of whether infections were single or mixed. Further, we show that aP vaccination impedes host immunity against B. parapertussis-measured as reduced lung inflammatory and neutrophil responses. Thus, we conclude that aP vaccination interferes with the optimal clearance of B. parapertussis and enhances the performance of this pathogen. Our data raise the possibility that widespread aP vaccination can create hosts more susceptible to B. parapertussis infection.

TI Monitoring long-term evolutionary changes following Wolbachia
   introduction into a novel host: the Wolbachia popcorn infection in
   Drosophila simulans
AB Wolbachia may act as a biological control agent for pest management; in particular, the Wolbachia variant wMelPop (popcorn) shortens host longevity and may be useful for dengue suppression. However, long-term changes in the host and Wolbachia genomes can alter Wolbachia spread and/or host effects that suppress disease. Here, we investigate the phenotypic effects of wMelPop in a non-native host, Drosophila simulans, following artificial transinfection approximately 200 generations ago. Long-term rearing and maintenance of the bacteria were at 19 degrees C in the original I-102 genetic background that was transinfected with the popcorn strain. The bacteria were then introgressed into three massbred backgrounds, and tetracycline was used to create uninfected sublines. The effect of wMelPop on longevity in this species appears to have changed; longevity was no longer reduced at 25 degrees C in some nuclear backgrounds, reflecting different geographical origin, selection or drift, although the reduction was still evident for flies held at 30 degrees C. Wolbachia influenced productivity and viability, and development time in some host backgrounds. These findings suggest that long-term attenuation of Wolbachia effects may compromise the effectiveness of this bacterium in pest control. They also emphasize the importance of host nuclear background on Wolbachia phenotypic effects.

TI CRISPR-mediated phage resistance and the ghost of coevolution past

This mechanism of anti-viral defence, known by the acronym CRISPR, simultaneously stores detailed information about current and past enemies and the evolved resistance to them. As a high-resolution genetic marker that is intimately tied with the host-pathogen interaction, the CRISPR system offers a unique, and relatively untapped, opportunity to study epidemiological and coevolutionary dynamics in microbial communities that were previously neglected because they could not be cultured in the laboratory. We briefly review the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-mediated host-pathogen resistance, before assessing their potential importance for coevolution in nature, and their utility as a means of studying coevolutionary dynamics through metagenomics and laboratory experimentation.

TI The evolution of sex-specific immune defences
AB Why do males and females often differ in their ability to cope with infection? Beyond physiological mechanisms, it has recently been proposed that life-history theory could explain immune differences from an adaptive point of view in relation to sex-specific reproductive strategies. However, a point often overlooked is that the benefits of immunity, and possibly the costs, depend not only on the host genotype but also on the presence and the phenotype of pathogens. To address this issue we developed an adaptive dynamic model that includes host-pathogen population dynamics and host sexual reproduction. Our model predicts that, although different reproductive strategies, following Bateman's principle, are not enough to select for different levels of immunity, males and females respond differently to further changes in the characteristics of either sex. For example, if males are more exposed to infection than females (e. g. for behavioural reasons), it is possible to see them evolve lower immunocompetence than females. This and other counterintuitive results highlight the importance of ecological feedbacks in the evolution of immune defences. While this study focuses on sex-specific natural selection, it could easily be extended to include sexual selection and thus help to understand the interplay between the two processes.

Using satellite measurements of global and regional elevated sea surface temperatures, elevated rainfall, and satellite derived-normalized difference vegetation index data, we predicted with lead times of 2-4 months areas where outbreaks of RVF in humans and animals were expected and occurred in the Horn of Africa, Sudan, and Southern Africa at different time periods from September 2006 to March 2008. Predictions were confirmed by entomological field investigations of virus activity and by reported cases of RVF in human and livestock populations. This represents the first series of prospective predictions of RVF outbreaks and provides a baseline for improved early warning, control, response planning, and mitigation into the future.

TI Pathogen Exclusion from Eco-Epidemiological Systems
AB Increasing concerns about the changing environment and the emergence of pathogens that cross species boundaries have added to the urgency of understanding the dynamics of complex ecological systems infected by pathogens. Of particular interest is the often counterintuitive way in which infection and predation interact and the consequent difficulties in designing control strategies to manage the system. To understand the mechanisms involved, we focus on the pathogen exclusion problem, using control maps ( on which the network of exclusion thresholds are plotted) in order to readily identify which exclusion strategies will work and why others will not. We apply this approach to the analysis of parasite exclusion in two game bird ecologies. For higher dimensions, we propose a computational scheme that will generate the optimal exclusion strategy, taking into account all operational constraints on the pathogen invasion matrix, populations, and controls. The situation is further complicated when external forcing distorts pathogen thresholds. This distortion is highly sensitive to the lags between forcing components, a sensitivity that can be exploited by management using correctly lagged cyclically varying controls to reduce the effort involved in pathogen exclusion.

TI The role of Sphagnum mosses in the methane cycling of a boreal mire
AB Peatlands are a major natural source of atmospheric methane (CH(4)). Emissions from Sphagnum-dominated mires are lower than those measured from other mire types. This observation may partly be due to methanotrophic (i.e., methane-consuming) bacteria associated with Sphagnum. Twenty-three of the 41 Sphagnum species in Finland can be found in the peatland at Lakkasuo. To better understand the Sphagnum-methanotroph system, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) all these Sphagnum species support methanotrophic bacteria; (2) water level is the key environmental determinant for differences in methanotrophy across habitats; (3) under dry conditions, Sphagnum species will not host methanotrophic bacteria; and (4) methanotrophs can move from one Sphagnum shoot to another in an aquatic environment. To address hypotheses 1 and 2, we measured the water table and CH(4) oxidation for all Sphagnum species at Lakkasuo in 1-5 replicates for each species. Using this systematic approach, we included Sphagnum spp. with narrow and broad ecological tolerances. To estimate the potential contribution of CH(4) to moss carbon, we measured the uptake of delta(13)C supplied as CH(4) or as carbon dioxide dissolved in water. To test hypotheses 2-4, we transplanted inactive moss patches to active sites and measured their methanotroph communities before and after transplantation. All 23 Sphagnum species showed methanotrophic activity, confirming hypothesis 1. We found that water level was the key environmental factor regulating methanotrophy in Sphagnum (hypothesis 2). Mosses that previously exhibited no CH(4) oxidation became active when transplanted to an environment in which the microbes in the control mosses were actively oxidizing CH(4) (hypothesis 4). Newly active transplants possessed a Methylocystis signature also found in the control Sphagnum spp. Inactive transplants also supported a Methylocystis signature in common with active transplants and control mosses, which rejects hypothesis 3. Our results imply a loose symbiosis between Sphagnum spp. and methanotrophic bacteria that accounts for potentially 10-30% of Sphagnum carbon.

Transmission is facilitated by the prolonged environmental survival of these viruses and their greater resistance to biocides. Serious outbreaks with neurological and cardiopulmonary complications caused by human enterovirus 71 (HEV-71) seem to be commoner in the Asian Pacific region than elsewhere in the world. This geographical predilection is unexplained but could be related to the frequency of intra- and inter-typic genetic recombinations of the virus, the host populations' genetic predisposition, environmental hygiene, and standard of healthcare. Vaccine development could be hampered by the general mildness of the illness and rapid genetic evolution of the virus. Antivirals are not readily available; the role of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of serious complications should be investigated. Monitoring of this disease and its epidemiology in the densely populated Asia Pacific epicentre is important for the detection of emerging epidemics due to enteroviruses.

TI MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC VARIATION IN IMMUNE DEFENSE OF A FRESHWATER
   SNAIL: ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY
AB Natural populations often show genetic variation in pathogen resistance, which is paradoxal because natural selection is expected to erode genetic variation in fitness-related traits. Several different factors have been suggested to maintain such variation, but their relative importance is still poorly understood. Here we examined if environmental heterogeneity and genetic trade-offs could contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in immune function of a freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. We assessed the immunocompetence of snails originating from different families and maintained in different feeding treatments (ad libitum feeding, no food) by measuring the density of circulating hemocytes, phenoloxidase activity, and antibacterial activity of snail hemolymph. Food limitation reduced snail immune function, and we found significant among-family variation in hemocyte concentration and PO activity, but not in antibacterial activity. Interestingly, food availability modified the family-level variation observed in PO activity so that the relative immunocompetence of different snail families changed over environmental conditions (G x E interaction). We found no evidence for genetic trade-offs between snail growth and immune defense nor among immune traits. Thus, our findings support the idea that environmental heterogeneity may promote maintenance of genetic variation in immune defense, but also suggest that different immune traits might not respond similarly to environmental variation.

TI THE EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS OF CONFLICT BETWEEN PARASITES WITH
   DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION MODES
AB Understanding the processes that shape the evolution of parasites is a key challenge for evolutionary biology. It is well understood that different parasites may often infect the same host and that this may have important implications to the evolutionary behavior. Here we examine the evolutionary implications of the conflict that arises when two parasite species, one vertically transmitted and the other horizontally transmitted, infect the same host. We show that the presence of a vertically transmitted parasite (VTP) often leads to the evolution of higher virulence in horizontally transmitted parasites (HTPs), particularly if the VTPs are feminizing. The high virulence in some HTPs may therefore result from coinfection with cryptic VTPs. The impact of an HTP on a VTP evolution depends crucially on the nature of the life-history trade-offs. Fast virulent HTPs select for intermediate feminization and virulence in VTPs. Coevolutionary models show similar insights, but emphasize the importance of host life span to the outcome, with higher virulence in both types of parasite in short-lived hosts. Overall, our models emphasize the interplay of host and parasite characteristics in the evolutionary outcome and point the way for further empirical study.

TI VARIATION BETWEEN POPULATIONS AND LOCAL ADAPTATION IN
   ACANTHOCEPHALAN-INDUCED PARASITE MANIPULATION
AB Many trophically transmitted parasites manipulate their intermediate host phenotype, resulting in higher transmission to the final host. However, it is not known if manipulation is a fixed adaptation of the parasite or a dynamic process upon which selection still acts. In particular, local adaptation has never been tested in manipulating parasites. In this study, using experimental infections between six populations of the acanthocephalan parasite Pomphorhynchus laevis and its amphipod host Gammarus pulex, we investigated whether a manipulative parasite may be locally adapted to its host. We compared adaptation patterns for infectivity and manipulative ability. We first found a negative effect of all parasite infections on host survival. Both parasite and host origins influenced infection success. We found a tendency for higher infectivity in sympatric versus allopatric combinations, but detailed analyses revealed significant differences for two populations only. Conversely, no pattern of local adaptation was found for behavioral manipulation, but manipulation ability varied among parasite origins. This suggests that parasites may adapt their investment in behavioral manipulation according to some of their host's characteristics. In addition, all naturally infected host populations were less sensitive to parasite manipulation compared to a naive host population, suggesting that hosts may evolve a general resistance to manipulation.

TI Radiotelemetry reveals variation in fever and sickness behaviours with
   latitude in a free-living passerine
AB P>1. The acute phase immune response, which includes fever and sickness behaviours, carries high costs in energy and time, but enhances pathogen clearance in diverse hosts. Hypotheses based upon pathogen pressures and life-history trade-offs predict that costly immune responses will decrease in strength as latitude increases. However, whether the acute phase response shows latitudinal patterns among free-living, wild populations remains unknown.
   2. Here, we studied fever and sickness behaviours during the early breeding season in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) along a latitudinal gradient in southern California (CA), Washington (WA), and Alaska (AK). In 2007 and 2008, we injected males with lipopolysaccharide and assessed sickness behaviour by measuring changes in territorial aggression. In 2008, we monitored fever and sickness behaviour in CA and WA birds using a novel telemetric technique: skin-mounted radiotransmitters with temperature sensors.
   3. In 2007, territorial defence varied by latitude, with a lower probability of territorial response at 24 h after injection in CA, but not in WA or AK. Radiotelemetry in 2008 revealed that CA birds showed pronounced and prolonged lethargy and fever (c. 2 degrees C above control males throughout the night), whereas WA birds showed only moderate lethargy and fever (c. 1 degrees C, returning to control levels during the night).
   4. This study establishes radiotelemetry as a powerful method for quantifying fever and sickness behaviours in small, free-living vertebrates. Moreover, our data suggest that latitude predicts the strength of these responses. These results can provide insight into disease susceptibility and spread among wild populations.

TI Parasites can cause selection against migrants following dispersal
   between environments
AB P>1. The potential for selection against migrants to promote population divergence and speciation is well established in theory, yet there has been relatively little empirical work that has explicitly considered selection against migrants as a form of reproductive barrier, and its importance in the accumulation of reproductive isolation between populations has been overlooked until recently.
   2. Parasites often differ between environments and can be an important source of selection on hosts, yet their contribution to population divergence in general, and selection against migrants in particular, is poorly understood.
   3. Selection against migrants might be reduced if organisms escape parasitism when they disperse (natural enemy release). Alternatively, parasites could increase selection against migrants if, when they disperse, organisms encounter parasites to which they are poorly adapted.
   4. Here we test experimentally the contribution that parasites could make to selection against migrants in the adaptive radiation of three-spined sticklebacks. These fish have repeatedly colonized freshwater environments from marine ones, and this has repeatedly lead to rapid speciation.
   5. We use transplant experiments of lab-raised fish to simulate dispersal, and antihelminthic treatment to show that ancestral-type marine sticklebacks contract higher burdens of novel parasites when introduced to freshwater, than in saltwater, and suffer a growth cost as a direct result.
   6. Susceptibility to parasites and their detrimental effect is less in derived, freshwater fish from evolutionarily young populations, possibly as a result of selection for resistance.
   7. Our results support a role for parasites in selection against migrants and population diversification. They do not support the hypothesis of 'natural enemy release'.

TI Habitat degradation and the decline of the threatened mussel
   Margaritifera margaritifera: influence of turbidity and sedimentation on
   the mussel and its host
AB P>1. Habitat degradation is a major reason for species extinctions. For parasite-host interactions, the decline of a parasite may not only be related to the parasite's tolerance to habitat degradation but also indirectly through the host's tolerance to the same disturbance.
   2. Our objective was to explore the cause of population declines of the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera by relating the age distribution, density and growth of the mussels with turbidity, sedimentation rates and density of the mussel's host, trout Salmo trutta, in 26 Swedish streams.
   3. An analysis of the age structure of nine mussel populations showed that maximum age differed by 60 years, with five populations having low proportions of juvenile mussels. Adult mussel density was higher at sites where juvenile mussels occurred than at sites lacking juvenile mussels.
   4. Growth of adult mussels during the past 10 years was lower in the five streams lacking recent recruitment than in the four streams with recent recruitment, indicating that some environmental factor may be negatively impacting these populations.
   5. A comparison among 24 populations indicated that turbidity and sedimentation may be responsible for recruitment failure in 58% of the populations. The age of the youngest mussel was positively related to turbidity and sedimentation, and juvenile mussel density was negatively related to turbidity and sedimentation. In contrast, trout density was not related to recruitment of mussels or sedimentation, but was positively related to turbidity in all streams, both with and without recent mussel recruitment.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Recruitment failure of M. margaritifera appears to be related to its own vulnerability to turbidity and sedimentation rather than to its host's response to this type of habitat degradation. The results from our study suggest that managers might be able to evaluate the potential viability of mussel populations by measuring stream turbidity. Restoration activities to improve the mussels' environment should focus on reducing fine material transport into streams.

TI Culling wildlife hosts to control disease: mountain hares, red grouse
   and louping ill virus
AB P>1. Culling wildlife hosts is often implemented as a management technique to control pathogen transmission from wildlife to domestic or other economically important animals. However, culling may have unexpected consequences, can be expensive and may have wider implications for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
   2. We assess the evidence that culling mountain hares Lepus timidus is an effective and practical way to control louping ill virus in red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus.
   3. Evidence from the available literature is limited, restricting our ability to reliably assess the effectiveness of culling mountain hares to control ticks, louping ill virus, or increase red grouse densities. Furthermore, the information required to assess the cost-benefit of this management strategy is lacking. The population response of mountain hares to culling is not well understood and the possible effects on their conservation status and the upland ecosystem remain unexplored.
   4. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence base to suggest culling mountain hares might increase red grouse densities.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Widespread culling of wildlife is not necessarily effective in reducing disease or improving economic returns. The use of wildlife culls for disease control should be proposed only when: (i) the pathogen transmission cycle is fully understood with all host-vector interactions considered; (ii) the response of wildlife populations to culling is known; and (iii) cost-benefit analysis shows that increased revenue from reduced disease prevalence exceeds the cost of culling.

TI Common garden experiment reveals pathogen isolate but no host genetic
   diversity effect on the dynamics of an emerging wildlife disease
AB Host genetic diversity can mediate pathogen resistance within and among populations. Here we test whether the lower prevalence of Mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in native North American house finch populations results from greater resistance to the causative agent, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), than introduced, recently-bottlenecked populations that lack genetic diversity. In a common garden experiment, we challenged wild-caught western (native) and eastern (introduced) North American finches with a representative eastern or western MG isolate. Although introduced finches in our study had lower neutral genetic diversity than native finches, we found no support for a population-level genetic diversity effect on host resistance. Instead we detected strong support for isolate differences: the MG isolate circulating in western house finch populations produced lower virulence, but higher pathogen loads, in both native and introduced hosts. Our results indicate that contemporary differences in host genetic diversity likely do not explain the lower conjunctivitis prevalence in native house finches, but isolate-level differences in virulence may play an important role.

TI Molecular genetic analysis of virus isolates from wild and cultivated
   plants demonstrates that East Africa is a hotspot for the evolution and
   diversification of Sweet potato feathery mottle virus
AB Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV, genus Potyvirus) is globally the most common pathogen of cultivated sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas; Convolvulaceae). Although more than 150 SPFMV isolates have been sequence-characterized from cultivated sweet potatos across the world, little is known about SPFMV isolates from wild hosts and the evolutionary forces shaping SPFMV population structures. In this study, 46 SPFMV isolates from 14 wild species of genera Ipomoea, Hewittia and Lepistemon (barcoded for the matK gene in this study) and 13 isolates from cultivated sweet potatoes were partially sequenced. Wild plants were infected with the EA, C or O strain, or co-infected with the EA and C strains of SPFMV. In East Africa, SPFMV populations in wild species and sweet potato were genetically undifferentiated, suggesting inter-host transmission of SPFMV. Globally, spatial diversification of the 178 isolates analysed was observed, strain EA being largely geographically restricted to East Africa. Recombination was frequently detected in the 6K2-VPg-NIaPro region of the EA strain, demonstrating a recombination 'hotspot'. Recombination between strains EA and C was rare, despite their frequent co-infections in wild plants, suggesting purifying selection against strain EA/C recombinants. Positive selection was predicted on 17 amino acids distributed over the entire coat protein in the globally distributed strain C, as compared to only four amino acids in the coat protein N-terminus of the EA strain. This selection implies a more recent introduction of the C strain and a higher adaptation of the EA strain to the local ecosystem. Thus, East Africa appears as a hotspot for evolution and diversification of SPFMV.

TI Ecology of malaria parasites infecting Southeast Asian macaques:
   evidence from cytochrome b sequences
AB Although malaria parasites infecting non-human primates are important models for human malaria, little is known of the ecology of infection by these parasites in the wild. We extensively sequenced cytochrome b (cytb) of malaria parasites (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida) from free-living southeast Asian monkeys Macaca nemestrina and Macaca fascicularis. The two most commonly observed taxa were Plasmodium inui and Hepatocystis sp., but certain other sequences did not cluster closely with any previously sequenced species. Most of the major clades of parasites were found in both Macaca species, and the two most commonly occurring parasite infected the two Macaca species at approximately equal levels. However, P. inui showed evidence of genetic differentiation between the populations infecting the two Macaca species, suggesting limited movement of this parasite among hosts. Moreover, coinfection with Plasmodium and Hepatocystis species occurred significantly less frequently than expected on the basis of the rates of infection with either taxon alone, suggesting the possibility of competitive exclusion. The results revealed unexpectedly complex communities of Plasmodium and Hepatocystis taxa infecting wild southeast Asian monkeys. Parasite taxa differed with respect to both the frequency of between-host movement and their frequency of coinfection.

TI Computational Models of HIV-1 Resistance to Gene Therapy Elucidate
   Therapy Design Principles
AB Gene therapy is an emerging alternative to conventional anti-HIV-1 drugs, and can potentially control the virus while alleviating major limitations of current approaches. Yet, HIV-1's ability to rapidly acquire mutations and escape therapy presents a critical challenge to any novel treatment paradigm. Viral escape is thus a key consideration in the design of any gene-based technique. We develop a computational model of HIV's evolutionary dynamics in vivo in the presence of a genetic therapy to explore the impact of therapy parameters and strategies on the development of resistance. Our model is generic and captures the properties of a broad class of gene-based agents that inhibit early stages of the viral life cycle. We highlight the differences in viral resistance dynamics between gene and standard antiretroviral therapies, and identify key factors that impact long-term viral suppression. In particular, we underscore the importance of mutationally-induced viral fitness losses in cells that are not genetically modified, as these can severely constrain the replication of resistant virus. We also propose and investigate a novel treatment strategy that leverages upon gene therapy's unique capacity to deliver different genes to distinct cell populations, and we find that such a strategy can dramatically improve efficacy when used judiciously within a certain parametric regime. Finally, we revisit a previously-suggested idea of improving clinical outcomes by boosting the proliferation of the genetically-modified cells, but we find that such an approach has mixed effects on resistance dynamics. Our results provide insights into the short- and long-term effects of gene therapy and the role of its key properties in the evolution of resistance, which can serve as guidelines for the choice and optimization of effective therapeutic agents.

TI The International Limits and Population at Risk of Plasmodium vivax
   Transmission in 2009
AB Background: A research priority for Plasmodium vivax malaria is to improve our understanding of the spatial distribution of risk and its relationship with the burden of P. vivax disease in human populations. The aim of the research outlined in this article is to provide a contemporary evidence-based map of the global spatial extent of P. vivax malaria, together with estimates of the human population at risk (PAR) of any level of transmission in 2009.
   Methodology: The most recent P. vivax case-reporting data that could be obtained for all malaria endemic countries were used to classify risk into three classes: malaria free, unstable (<0.1 case per 1,000 people per annum (p. a.)) and stable (>= 0.1 case per 1,000 p. a.) P. vivax malaria transmission. Risk areas were further constrained using temperature and aridity data based upon their relationship with parasite and vector bionomics. Medical intelligence was used to refine the spatial extent of risk in specific areas where transmission was reported to be absent (e. g., large urban areas and malaria-free islands). The PAR under each level of transmission was then derived by combining the categorical risk map with a high resolution population surface adjusted to 2009. The exclusion of large Duffy negative populations in Africa from the PAR totals was achieved using independent modelling of the gene frequency of this genetic trait. It was estimated that 2.85 billion people were exposed to some risk of P. vivax transmission in 2009, with 57.1% of them living in areas of unstable transmission. The vast majority (2.59 billion, 91.0%) were located in Central and South East (CSE) Asia, whilst the remainder were located in America (0.16 billion, 5.5%) and in the Africa+region (0.10 billion, 3.5%). Despite evidence of ubiquitous risk of P. vivax infection in Africa, the very high prevalence of Duffy negativity throughout Central and West Africa reduced the PAR estimates substantially.
   Conclusions: After more than a century of development and control, P. vivax remains more widely distributed than P. falciparum and is a potential cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the 2.85 billion people living at risk of infection, the majority of whom are in the tropical belt of CSE Asia. The probability of infection is reduced massively across Africa by the frequency of the Duffy negative trait, but transmission does occur on the continent and is a concern for Duffy positive locals and travellers. The final map provides the spatial limits on which the endemicity of P. vivax transmission can be mapped to support future cartographic-based burden estimations.

TI Establishment of Fruit Bat Cells (Rousettus aegyptiacus) as a Model
   System for the Investigation of Filoviral Infection
AB Background: The fruit bat species Rousettus aegyptiacus was identified as a potential reservoir for the highly pathogenic filovirus Marburg virus. To establish a basis for a molecular understanding of the biology of filoviruses in the reservoir host, we have adapted a set of molecular tools for investigation of filovirus replication in a recently developed cell line, R06E, derived from the species Rousettus aegyptiacus.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Upon infection with Ebola or Marburg viruses, R06E cells produced viral titers comparable to VeroE6 cells, as shown by TCID50 analysis. Electron microscopic analysis of infected cells revealed morphological signs of filovirus infection as described for human-and monkey- derived cell lines. Using R06E cells, we detected an unusually high amount of intracellular viral proteins, which correlated with the accumulation of high numbers of filoviral nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. We established protocols to produce Marburg infectious virus-like particles from R06E cells, which were then used to infect naive target cells to investigate primary transcription. This was not possible with other cell lines previously tested. Moreover, we established protocols to reliably rescue recombinant Marburg viruses from R06E cells.
   Conclusion/Significance: These data indicated that R06E cells are highly suitable to investigate the biology of filoviruses in cells derived from their presumed reservoir.

TI Serodiagnosis of Echinococcus spp. Infection: Explorative Selection of
   Diagnostic Antigens by Peptide Microarray
AB Background: Production of native antigens for serodiagnosis of helminthic infections is laborious and hampered by batch-to-batch variation. For serodiagnosis of echinococcosis, especially cystic disease, most screening tests rely on crude or purified Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst fluid. To resolve limitations associated with native antigens in serological tests, the use of standardized and highly pure antigens produced by chemical synthesis offers considerable advantages, provided appropriate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is achieved.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Making use of the growing collection of genomic and proteomic data, we applied a set of bioinformatic selection criteria to a collection of protein sequences including conceptually translated nucleotide sequence data of two related tapeworms, Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus. Our approach targeted alpha-helical coiled-coils and intrinsically unstructured regions of parasite proteins potentially exposed to the host immune system. From 6 proteins of E. multilocularis and 5 proteins of E. granulosus, 45 peptides between 24 and 30 amino acids in length were designed. These peptides were chemically synthesized, spotted on microarrays and screened for reactivity with sera from infected humans. Peptides reacting above the cut-off were validated in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Peptides identified failed to differentiate between E. multilocularis and E. granulosus infection. The peptide performing best reached 57% sensitivity and 94% specificity. This candidate derived from Echinococcus multilocularis antigen B8/1 and showed strong reactivity to sera from patients infected either with E. multilocularis or E. granulosus.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study provides proof of principle for the discovery of diagnostically relevant peptides by bioinformatic selection complemented with screening on a high-throughput microarray platform. Our data showed that a single peptide cannot provide sufficient diagnostic sensitivity whereas pooling several peptide antigens improved sensitivity; thus combinations of several peptides may lead the way to new diagnostic tests that replace, or at least complement conventional immunodiagnosis of echinococcosis. Our strategy could prove useful for diagnostic developments in other pathogens.

TI Transmission of Schistosoma japonicum in Marshland and Hilly Regions of
   China: Parasite Population Genetic and Sibship Structure
AB The transmission dynamics of Schistosoma japonicum remain poorly understood, as over forty species of mammals are suspected of serving as reservoir hosts. However, knowledge of the population genetic structure and of the full-sibship structuring of parasites at two larval stages will be useful in defining and tracking the transmission pattern between intermediate and definitive hosts. S. japonicum larvae were therefore collected in three marshland and three hilly villages in Anhui Province of China across three time points: April and September-October 2006, and April 2007, and then genotyped with six microsatellite markers. Results from the population genetic and sibling relationship analyses of the parasites across two larval stages demonstrated that, within the marshland, parasites from cattle showed higher genetic diversity than from other species; whereas within the hilly region, parasites from dogs and humans displayed higher genetic diversity than those from rodents. Both the extent of gene flow and the estimated proportion of full-sib relationships of parasites between two larval stages indicated that the cercariae identified within intermediate hosts in the marshlands mostly came from cattle, whereas in the hilly areas, they were varied between villages, coming primarily from rodents, dogs or humans. Such results suggest a different transmission process within the hilly region from within the marshlands. Moreover, this is the first time that the sibling relationship analysis was applied to the transmission dynamics for S. japonicum.

TI The Role of Imported Cases and Favorable Meteorological Conditions in
   the Onset of Dengue Epidemics
AB Background: Travelers who acquire dengue infection are often routes for virus transmission to other regions. Nevertheless, the interplay between infected travelers, climate, vectors, and indigenous dengue incidence remains unclear. The role of foreign-origin cases on local dengue epidemics thus has been largely neglected by research. This study investigated the effect of both imported dengue and local meteorological factors on the occurrence of indigenous dengue in Taiwan.
   Methods and Principal Findings: Using logistic and Poisson regression models, we analyzed bi-weekly, laboratory-confirmed dengue cases at their onset dates of illness from 1998 to 2007 to identify correlations between indigenous dengue and imported dengue cases (in the context of local meteorological factors) across different time lags. Our results revealed that the occurrence of indigenous dengue was significantly correlated with temporally-lagged cases of imported dengue (2-14 weeks), higher temperatures (6-14 weeks), and lower relative humidity (6-20 weeks). In addition, imported and indigenous dengue cases had a significant quantitative relationship in the onset of local epidemics. However, this relationship became less significant once indigenous epidemics progressed past the initial stage.
   Conclusions: These findings imply that imported dengue cases are able to initiate indigenous epidemics when appropriate weather conditions are present. Early detection and case management of imported cases through rapid diagnosis may avert large-scale epidemics of dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever. The deployment of an early-warning surveillance system, with the capacity to integrate meteorological data, will be an invaluable tool for successful prevention and control of dengue, particularly in non-endemic countries.

TI Hantaviruses and Their Hosts in Europe: Reservoirs Here and There, But
   Not Everywhere?
AB Five hantaviruses are known to circulate among rodents in Europe, and at least two among insectivores. Four (Dobrava, Saaremaa, Seoul, and Puumala [PUUV] viruses) are clearly associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). PUUV, the most common etiological agent of HFRS in Europe, is carried by the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), one of the most widespread and abundant mammal species in Europe. This host-virus system is among hantaviruses also the most studied one in Europe. However, HFRS incidence varies throughout the continent. The spatial as well as temporal variation in the occurrence of HFRS is linked to geographic differences in the population dynamics of the reservoir rodents in different biomes of Europe. While rodent abundance may follow mast seeding events in many parts of temperate Europe, in northern (N) Europe multiannual cycles in population density exist as the result of the interaction between rodent populations and specialist predator populations in a delayed density-dependent manner. The spatial distribution of hantaviruses further depends on parameters such as forest patch size and connectivity of the most suitable rodent habitats, and the conditions for the survival of the virus outside the host, as well as historical distribution patterns (phylogeographies) of hosts and viruses. In multiannually fluctuating populations of rodents, with population increases of great amplitude, one should expect a simultaneous build-up of recently hantavirus-infected (shedding) rodents. The increasing number of infectious, virus-shedding rodents leads to a rapid transmission of hantavirus across the rodent population, and to humans. Our review discusses these aspects for PUUV, the only European hantavirus for which there is a reasonable, yet still far from complete, ecological continental-wide understanding. We discuss how this information could translate to other European hantavirus-host systems, and where the most important questions lie for further research.

TI Ecology of Hantaviruses and Their Hosts in North America
AB Since the 1993 discovery of a highly pathogenic hantavirus associated with the North American deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), intensive ecological studies have led to many advances in our understanding of the natural history of New World hantaviruses as it relates to human disease. Seventeen named hantaviruses have been identified in North America. Field and laboratory studies of Sin Nombre and other hantaviruses have delineated host associations, geographical distributions, mechanisms of transmission, temporal infection dynamics of these viruses in host populations, and environmental factors that influence these dynamics. Using data from these studies, preliminary predictive models of the risk of hantavirus infection to humans have been developed. Improved models using satellite-derived data are under development. Multidisciplinary collaboration, integration of field and laboratory studies, and establishment and maintenance of long-term monitoring studies will be critical to continued advancement in the understanding of hantavirus-host ecology and disease prevention in humans.

TI Sampling Frequency Differentially Influences Interpretation of Zoonotic
   Pathogen and Host Dynamics: Sin Nombre Virus and Deer Mice
AB Reports of novel emerging and resurging wildlife and zoonotic diseases have increased. Consequently, integration of pathogen sampling into wildlife monitoring programs has grown. Sampling frequency influences interpretations of coupled host-pathogen dynamics, with direct implication to human exposure risk, but has received little empirical attention. To address this, a 15-year study, based on monthly sampling, of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) populations and Sin Nombre virus (SNV; a virulent disease in humans) dynamics was evaluated. Estimates of deer mouse abundance, number infected with SNV, and SNV prevalence from sampling less frequently than each month (achieved by deletion of months and recalculation of these parameters) were compared to monthly sampling frequencies. Deer mouse abundance was underestimated (10%-20%), SNV prevalence was overestimated when prevalence was high (>15%), and fewer annual extremes of abundance and infection were detected when sampling frequency was less than monthly. Effort necessary to detect temporal dynamics of SNV differed from effort to detect demographic patterns in deer mouse abundance. Findings here are applicable to sampling strategies for other host-pathogen dynamics and have direct implications for allocation of public health resources and intervention programs.

TI Tula Virus in Populations of Small Terrestrial Mammals in a Rural

AB Over 5 years (2000-2004), populations of small mammals from a rural landscape in southern Moravia (Czech Republic) were investigated for the presence of Tula virus (TULV) antigen using the ELISA set Hantagnost. In total, 1566 individuals from 10 species were examined. The prevalence in the common vole (Microtus arvalis Pallas 1778), the main reservoir of TULV, was 10% (n=871). The prevalence of TULV antigen increases with its population numbers. The highest number of TULV antigen-positive common voles was found in set-aside plots and winter crops, such as rape and winter wheat. All these habitats are important for common vole over-wintering. Older and heavier individuals were more often hantavirus antigen positive. From the other small mammal species, 186 pygmy field mice (Apodemus uralensis Pallas, 1811) were examined, of which 3 were positive, which represents the first hantavirus antigen positive record for this species, and of 195 wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus Linnaeus, 1758) only 1 was positive. The remaining five rodent species (Apodemus flavicollis Melchior, 1834, Mus musculus Linnaeus, 1758, Micromys minutus Pallas, 1771, Myodes glareolus Schreber, 1780, Microtus subterraneus de Selys-Longchamps, 1836) and two Soricomorpha (Sorex araneus Linnaeus, 1758, Sorex minutus Linnaeus, 1766) were hantavirus antigen negative.

AB Coevolution between two antagonistic species follows the so-called 'Red Queen dynamics' when reciprocal selection results in an endless series of adaptation by one species and counteradaptation by the other. Red Queen dynamics are 'genetically driven' when selective sweeps involving new beneficial mutations result in perpetual oscillations of the coevolving traits on the slow evolutionary time scale. Mathematical models have shown that a prey and a predator can coevolve along a genetically driven Red Queen cycle. We found that embedding the prey-predator interaction into a three-species food chain that includes a coevolving superpredator often turns the genetically driven Red Queen cycle into chaos. A key condition is that the prey evolves fast enough. Red Queen chaos implies that the direction and strength of selection are intrinsically unpredictable beyond a short evolutionary time, with greatest evolutionary unpredictability in the superpredator. We hypothesize that genetically driven Red Queen chaos could explain why many natural populations are poised at the edge of ecological chaos. Over space, genetically driven chaos is expected to cause the evolutionary divergence of local populations, even under homogenizing environmental fluctuations, and thus to promote genetic diversity among ecological communities over long evolutionary time.

TI New Evidence Suggests Southern China as a Common Source of Multiple
   Clusters of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus
AB Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza is considered an avian disease, although there is some evidence of limited human-to-human transmission of the virus. A global effort is underway to control or eradicate the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in poultry and prevent human exposure, both of which may also reduce the risk of pandemic emergence. Hemagglutinin gene sequences from 215 human H5N1 influenza viruses were used to trace the source and dispersal pattern of human H5N1 influenza viruses on a global scale. A mutation network and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin gene show that human H5N1 influenza viruses can be clearly divided among 4 clusters across geographic space. On the basis of analysis of the N-glycosylation sites at positions 100 and 170 in the hemagglutinin protein, human H5N1 influenza viruses were also divided into 3 types. When we combined these analyses with geographic information system data analyses, we found that Southern China is often a common source of multiple clusters of H5N1 influenza viruses and that each cluster has different dispersal patterns and individual evolutionary features. In summary, the genetic evidence presented here provides clear evidence for multiple clusters of human H5N1 influenza viruses that initially originated in Southern China.

TI Aestivation of the African Malaria Mosquito, Anopheles gambiae in the
   Sahel
AB The African malaria mosquito. Anopheles gambiae, inhabits diverse environments including dry savannas, where surface waters required for larval development are absent for 4-8 months per year Under such conditions, An gambiae virtually disappears Whether populations survive the long dry season by aestivation (a dormant state promoting extended longevity during the summer) or are reestablished by migrants from distant locations where larval sites persist has remained an enigma for over 60 years Resolving this question is important, because fragile dry season populations may be more susceptible to control. Here, we show unequivocally that An gambiae aestivates based on a demographic study and a mark release recapture experiment spanning the period from the end of one wet season to the beginning of the next. During the dry season. An. gambiae was barely detectable in Sahehan villages of Mali. Five days after the first rain. before a new generation of adults could be produced. mosquito abundance surged 10-fold, implying that most mosquitoes were concealed locally until the rain Four clays after the first rain, a marked female An gambiae s.s was recaptured Initially captured, marked, and released at the end of the previous wet season, she has survived the 7-month-long dry season These results provide evidence that An. gambiae persists throughout the dry season by aestivation and open new questions for mosquito and parasite research Improved malaria control by targeting aestivating mosquitoes using existing or novel strategies may be possible.

We examined vector competence of Culex ptptens Linnaeus and Cx restuans Theobald mosquitoes for West Nile virus collected over 3 years from 17 sites to measure spatial and temporal scales of variation in vector competence We found extreme variation with 0-52% of mosquitoes transmitting West Nile virus at a single site between different sampling periods, and similar variation across populations However, we also found that within a smaller geographic range, vector competence varied somewhat synchronously, suggesting that environmental and population genetic factors might influence vector competence These results highlight the spatio-temporal variability in vector competence and the role of local processes

TI Interannual Variability of Human Plague Occurrence in the Western United
   States Explained by Tropical and North Pacific Ocean Climate Variability
AB Plague is a vector-borne, highly virulent zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Yersima pesos It persists in nature through transmission between its hosts (wild rodents) and vectors (fleas). During epizootics, the disease expands and spills over to other host species such as humans living in or close to affected areas Here, we investigate the effect of large-scale climate variability on the dynamics of human plague in the western United States using a 56-year time series of plague reports (1950-2005). We found that El Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation in combination affect the dynamics of human plague over the western United States. The underlying mechanism could involve changes in precipitation and temperatures that impact both hosts and vectors It is suggested that snow also may play a key role, possibly through its effects on summer soil moisture, which is known to be instrumental for flea survival and development and sustained growth of vegetation for rodents

TI Transmission Dynamics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza at Lake
   Constance (Europe) During the Outbreak of Winter 2005-2006
AB Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) H5N1 poses a serious threat to domestic animals. Despite the large number of studies on influenza A virus in waterbirds, little is still known about the transmission dynamics, including prevalence, behavior, and spread of these viruses in the wild waterbird population. From January to April 2006, the HPAI H5N1 virus was confirmed in 82 dead wild waterbirds at the shores of Lake Constance. In this study, we present simple mathematical models to examine this outbreak and to investigate the transmission dynamics of HPAI in wild waterbirds. The population dynamics model of wintering birds was best represented by a sinusoidal function. This model was considered the most adequate to represent the susceptible compartment of the SIR model. The three transmission models predict a basic reproduction ratio (R (0)) with value of approximately 1.6, indicating a small epidemic, which ended with the migration of susceptible wild waterbirds at the end of the winter. With this study, we quantify for the first time the transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus at Lake Constance during the outbreak of winter 2005-2006. It is a step toward the improvement of the knowledge of transmission of the virus among wild waterbirds.

TI Immmunological Clearance of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Infection at
   a Pathogen-optimal Temperature in the Hylid Frog Hypsiboas crepitans
AB Amphibian declines worldwide have been linked to the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Its causative agent (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, hereafter Bd), however, also infects many nondeclining species. Experimental infections have shown species-specific and temperature-dependent frog responses to Bd infection. Although Bd infection may be eliminated by housing amphibians at temperatures above those tolerated by the fungus, the question of whether frogs can eliminate infection under more favorable conditions remains unanswered. Repeated diagnostics using real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) assays of postmetamorphic individuals at 28, 38, 45, 53, and 62 days after exposure demonstrated that Hypsiboas crepitans is able to clear infection within a few weeks at 23A degrees C. Thus, we demonstrate a temperature-independent and likely immunological mechanism for the clearance of Bd in a resistant amphibian species. Future studies are needed to determine the generality of this mechanism among amphibians and to describe the immune factors affecting different outcomes of Bd exposure including resistance to infection, tolerance of infection, and clearance of infection.

TI Specificity between Neotropical tree seedlings and their fungal
   mutualists leads to plant-soil feedback
AB A growing body of evidence obtained largely from temperate grassland studies suggests that feedbacks occurring between plants and their associated soil biota are important to plant community assemblage. However, few studies have examined the importance of soil organisms in driving plant-soil feedbacks in forested systems. In a tropical forest in central Panama, we examined whether interactions between tree seedlings and their associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) lead to plant-soil feedback. Specifically, do tropical seedlings modify their own AMF communities in a manner that either favors or inhibits the next cohort of conspecific seedlings (i.e., positive or negative feedback, respectively)? Seedlings of two shade-tolerant tree species (Eugenia nesiotica, Virola surinamensis) and two pioneer tree species (Luehea seemannii, Apeiba aspera) were grown in pots containing identical AMF communities composed of equal amounts of inoculum of six co-occurring AMF species. The different AMF-host combinations were all exposed to two light levels. Under low light (2% PAR), only two of the six AMF species sporulated, and we found that host identity did not influence composition of AMF spore communities. However, relative abundances of three of the four AMF species that produced spores were influenced by host identity when grown under high light (20% PAR). Furthermore, spores of one of the AMF species, Glomus geosporum, were common in soils of Luehea and Eugenia but absent in soils of Apeiba and Virola. We then conducted a reciprocal experiment to test whether AMF communities previously modified by Luehea and Apeiba differentially affected the growth of conspecific and heterospecific seedlings. Luehea seedling growth did not differ between soils containing AMF communities modified by Luehea and Apeiba. However, Apeiba seedlings were significantly larger when grown with Apeiba-modified AMF communities, as compared to Apeiba seedlings grown with Luehea-modifed AMF communities. Our experiments suggest that interactions between tropical trees and their associated AMF are species-specific and that these interactions may shape both tree and AMF communities through plant-soil feedback.

TI Spatial heterogeneity in distribution and ecology of Western Palearctic
   birds
AB Species vary in abundance and heterogeneity of spatial distribution, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such variability are poorly known. Evolutionary adaptation to heterogeneously distributed resources may arise from local adaptation with individuals of such locally adapted populations rarely dispersing long distances and hence having small populations and small overall ranges. We quantified mean population density and spatial heterogeneity in population density of 197 bird species across 12 similarly sized regions in the Western Palearctic. Variance in population density among regions differed significantly from a Poisson distribution, suggesting that random processes cannot explain the observed patterns. National estimates of means and variances in population density were positively correlated with continental estimates, suggesting that means and variances were maintained across spatial scales. We used Morisita's index of population abundance as an estimate of heterogeneity in distribution among regions to test a number of predictions. Heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species as reflected by Morisita's index had small populations, low population densities, and small breeding ranges. Their breeding populations had been consistently maintained at low levels for considerable periods of time, because the degree of genetic variation in a subsample of non-passerines and passerines was significantly negatively related to heterogeneity in distribution. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species were not more often habitat specialists than homogeneously distributed species. Furthermore, heterogeneously distributed passerine species had high annual adult survival rates but did not differ in annual fecundity from homogeneously distributed species. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species rarely colonized urban habitats. Finally, homogeneously distributed bird species were hosts to a greater diversity of blood parasite species than heterogeneously distributed species. In conclusion, small breeding ranges, population sizes, and population densities of heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species, combined with their low degree of genetic variability, and their inability to colonize urban areas may render such species particularly susceptible to human-influenced global climatic changes.

TI Interspecific transmission of a male-killing bacterium on an ecological
   timescale
AB Inherited symbionts are important drivers of arthropod evolutionary ecology, with microbes acting both as partners that contribute to host adaptation, and as subtle parasites that drive host evolution. New symbioses are most commonly formed through lateral transfer, where a microbial symbiont passes infectiously from one host species to another, and then spreads through its new host population. However, the rate of horizontal transfer has been regarded as sufficiently low that population and coevolutionary processes can be approximated to one, where the symbiont interacts with a single host species. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that horizontal transfer of the son-killer infection of Nasonia wasps occurs readily following multi-parasitism events (two species of parasitoid wasp sharing a fly pupal host), and provide phylogenetic evidence of recent and likely ongoing transmission amongst members of the community of wasps utilizing filth flies. Combining per contact transmission rates estimated in the laboratory with rates of multiparasitism in the field produces an estimate that an infected Nasonia vitripennis individual in an Eastern US bird's nest habitat has a 12% chance of passing the infection into N. giraulti. We conclude that the single host-single symbiont framework is therefore insufficient for understanding the population and evolutionary dynamics in this system and caution against blind acceptance of the single host/single symbiont framework. We conjecture that lateral transfer rates that require a multi-host framework will most likely be seen in symbionts that retain the ability to cross host epithelia, and that this will be correlated to the recency with which the symbionts have been free living.

TI Determinants of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Clusters, California,
   USA, 2004-2007
AB Laboratory and epidemiologic evidence suggests that pathogen-specific factors may affect multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) transmission and pathogenesis. To identify demographic and clinical characteristics of MDR TB case clustering and to estimate the effect of specific isoniazid resistance conferring mutations and strain lineage on genotypic clustering, we conducted a population-based cohort study of all MDR TB cases reported in California from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2007. Of 8,899 incident culture-positive cases for which drug susceptibility information was available, 141 (2%) were MDR. Of 123 (87%) strains with genotype data, 25 (20%) were aggregated in 8 clusters; 113 (92%) of all MDR TB cases and 21 (84%) of clustered MDR TB cases occurred among foreign-born patients. In multivariate analysis, the katG S315T mutation (odds ratio 11.2, 95% confidence interval 2.2-infinity; p = 0.004), but not strain lineage, was independently associated with case clustering.

TI Quantifying how MHC polymorphism prevents pathogens from adapting to the
   antigen presentation pathway
AB The classical antigen presentation pathway consists of two monomorphic (proteasome and TAP) and one polymorphic components (MHC Class I). Viruses can escape CTL responses by mutating an epitope so that it is no longer correctly processed by the pathway. Whereas escape mutations that affect MHC binding are typically no longer under selection pressure in the next host of the virus (as hosts differ in their MHC alleles), escape mutations that affect the antigen processing of epitope precursors prevent the use of those epitope precursors by any of the MHC alleles in a host population. Viruses might therefore be under selection pressure to adapt to the monomorphic proteasome and TAP.
   We designed an agent-based model of a host population, in which an HIV-1 like virus adapts to the antigen presentation pathway of individual hosts, as the virus spreads through the population. We studied how the polymorphism of the MHC and the monomorphism of the proteasome and TAP affected the level of adaptation to the host population that the virus could reach.
   We found that due to the polymorphism and high specificity of the MHC class I molecules, the CTL epitopes that are targeted by the CTL responses of different hosts do not share many epitope precursors. Therefore, escape mutations in epitope precursors are frequently released from immune selection pressure, and can revert back to the virus wildtype sequence. As a result, the selection pressure on the virus to adapt to the proteasome and TAP is relatively small, which explains the low level of adaptation of the virus to the monomorphic steps in the antigen presentation pathway.

TI H1N1pdm in the Americas
AB In late April 2009 the emergence of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1pdm) virus was detected in humans. From its detection through July 18th, 2009, confirmed cases of H1N1pdm in the Americas were periodically reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) by member states. Because the Americas span much of the world's latitudes, this data provides an excellent opportunity to examine variation in H1N1pdm transmission by season.
   Using reports from PAHO member states from April 26th, 2009 through July 18th, 2009, we characterize the early spread of the H1N1 pandemic in the Americas. For a geographically representative sample of member states we estimate the reproductive number (R) of H1N1pdm over the reporting period. The association between these estimates and latitude, temperature, humidity and population age structure was estimated. Estimates of the peak reproductive number of H1N1pdm ranged from 1.3 (for Panama, Colombia) to 2.1 (for Chile). We found that reproductive number estimates were most associated with latitude in both univariate and multivariate analyses. To the extent that latitude is a proxy for seasonal changes in climate and behavior, this association suggests a strong seasonal component to H1N1pdm transmission. However, the reasons for this seasonality remain unclear. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Declining HCV seroprevalence in pregnant women with HIV
AB We assessed recent trends in hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence in pregnant women with HIV using data from a large national study. Based on 1240 pregnancies, we observed a 3.4-fold decline in HCV seroprevalence in pregnant women with HIV between 2001 (29.3%) and 2008(8.6%). This decline was the net result of two components: a progressively declining HCV seroprevalence in non-African women (from 35.7% in 2001 to 16.7% in 2008), sustained by a parallel reduction in history of injecting drug use (IDU) in this population, and a significantly growing presence (from 21.2% in 2001 to 48.6% in 2008) of women of African origin, at very low risk of being HCV-infected [average HCV prevalence 1%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for HCV 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.29]. Previous IDU was the stronger determinant of HCV co-infection in pregnant women with HIV (aOR 30.9, 95% CI 18.8-51.1). The observed trend is expected to translate into a reduced number of cases of vertical HCV transmission.

TI UNCOORDINATED PHYLOGEOGRAPHY OF BORRELIA BURGDORFERI AND ITS TICK
   VECTOR, IXODES SCAPULARIS
AB Vector-borne microbes necessarily co-occur with their hosts and vectors, but the degree to which they share common evolutionary or biogeographic histories remains unexplored. We examine the congruity of the evolutionary and biogeographic histories of the bacterium and vector of the Lyme disease system, the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America. In the eastern and midwestern US, Ixodes scapularis ticks are the primary vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Our phylogeographic and demographic analyses of the 16S mitochondrial rDNA suggest that northern I. scapularis populations originated from very few migrants from the southeastern US that expanded rapidly in the Northeast and subsequently in the Midwest after the recession of the Pleistocene ice sheets. Despite this historical gene flow, current tick migration is restricted even between proximal sites within regions. In contrast, B. burgdorferi suffers no barriers to gene flow within the northeastern and midwestern regions but shows clear interregional migration barriers. Despite the intimate association of B. burgdorferi and I. scapularis, the population structure, evolutionary history, and historical biogeography of the pathogen are all contrary to its arthropod vector. In the case of Lyme disease, movements of infected vertebrate hosts may play a larger role in the contemporary expansion and homogenization of the pathogen than the movement of tick vectors whose populations continue to bear the historical signature of climate-induced range shifts.

   function through global warming
AB P>1. We review the mechanisms behind ecosystem functions, the processes that facilitate energy transfer along food webs, and the major processes that allow the cycling of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, and use case studies to show how these have already been, and will continue to be, altered by global warming.
   2. Increased temperatures will affect the interactions between heterotrophs and autotrophs (e.g. pollination and seed dispersal), and between heterotrophs (e.g. predators-prey, parasites/pathogens-hosts), with generally negative ramifications for important ecosystem services (functions that provide direct benefit to human society such as pollination) and potential for heightened species co-extinction rates.
   3. Mitigation of likely impacts of warming will require, in particular, the maintenance of species diversity as insurance for the provision of basic ecosystem services. Key to this will be long-term monitoring and focused research that seek to maintain ecosystem resilience in the face of global warming.
   4. We provide guidelines for pursuing research that quantifies the nexus between ecosystem function and global warming. These include documentation of key functional species groups within systems, and understanding the principal outcomes arising from direct and indirect effects of a rapidly warming environment. Localized and targeted research and monitoring, complemented with laboratory work, will determine outcomes for resilience and guide adaptive conservation responses and long-term planning.

TI Local exposure shapes spatial patterns in infectivity and community
   structure of Daphnia parasites
AB P>1. Spatial patterns in parasite community structure are probably driven by the availability of infectious stages. This is because hosts become infected through picking up infectious stages from their environment. Several studies have, however, reported strong genotype by genotype interactions and parasite-mediated selection in hosts. This leads to the prediction of a parasite by host population interaction with respect to infection rates and intensities, which may also shape spatial patterns in parasite community structure.
   2. Using the water flea Daphnia magna and its microparasites as a model, we carried out a laboratory experiment to test explicitly to what extent parasite community structure in host populations is determined by the availability of infectious stages in the sediment they are exposed to, and to what extent host population identity and location play a role.
   3. We exposed 10 D. magna host populations each to sediment of their own habitat and sediment of the other nine habitats, and monitored the parasite community of the resulting experimental populations.
   4. Sediment seems to be a strong determinant of parasite infection rates, while there was no overall effect of host population. Sympatric parasite and host population combinations did in most cases not result in significantly different infection rates than allopatric parasite and host combinations. Our results indicate that spore availability could be the key variable determining parasite community structure in natural Daphnia populations.

TI Optimality models in the age of experimental evolution and genomics
AB Optimality models have been used to predict evolution of many properties of organisms. They typically neglect genetic details, whether by necessity or design. This omission is a common source of criticism, and although this limitation of optimality is widely acknowledged, it has mostly been defended rather than evaluated for its impact. Experimental adaptation of model organisms provides a new arena for testing optimality models and for simultaneously integrating genetics. First, an experimental context with a well-researched organism allows dissection of the evolutionary process to identify causes of model failure - whether the model is wrong about genetics or selection. Second, optimality models provide a meaningful context for the process and mechanics of evolution, and thus may be used to elicit realistic genetic bases of adaptation - an especially useful augmentation to well-researched genetic systems. A few studies of microbes have begun to pioneer this new direction. Incompatibility between the assumed and actual genetics has been demonstrated to be the cause of model failure in some cases. More interestingly, evolution at the phenotypic level has sometimes matched prediction even though the adaptive mutations defy mechanisms established by decades of classic genetic studies. Integration of experimental evolutionary tests with genetics heralds a new wave for optimality models and their extensions that does not merely emphasize the forces driving evolution.

TI Minority Variants of Drug-Resistant HIV
AB Minor drug-resistant variants exist in every patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Because these minority variants are usually present at very low levels, they cannot be detected and quantified using conventional genotypic and phenotypic tests. Recently, several assays have been developed to characterize these low-abundance drug-resistant variants in the large, genetically complex population that is present in every HIV-infected individual. The most important issue is what results generated by these assays can predict clinical or treatment outcomes and might guide the management of patients in clinical practice. Cutoff values for the detection of these low-abundance viral variants that predict an increased risk of treatment failure should be determined. These thresholds may be specific for each mutation and treatment regimen. In this review, we summarize the attributes and limitations of the currently available detection assays and review the existing information about both acquired and transmitted drug-resistant minority variants.

TI RotaTeq: Progress toward Developing World Access
AB Phase III studies of an oral, live, pentavalent, human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq; Merck) in developed countries have demonstrated that it is well tolerated with regard to intussusception and other adverse events and is efficacious in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis and associated healthcare encounters. However, it cannot be assumed that rotavirus vaccines will be equally efficacious in infants and young children in the developing world. Differences in host populations, associated health conditions, and the epidemiology of rotavirus disease could affect vaccine performance. Concern about the potential for differences in efficacy stems from studies of previous candidate rotavirus vaccines, including bovine and rhesus rotaviruses, which showed no or variable efficacy in developing regions. Given this history, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that the efficacy of "new" rotavirus vaccines should be demonstrated in diverse geographic areas, including developing countries, before widespread implementation. Successful implementation of any rotavirus vaccine in the developing world requires additional clinical research and sharing of early introduction experiences. We discuss efforts to bring RotaTeq vaccine to the developing world. Critical steps to achieve this goal include the clinical evaluation of vaccine safety and efficacy in a multisite trial in Asia and Africa, evaluation of concomitant use with other pediatric vaccines routinely used, and vaccine assessment in special populations (premature, human immunodeficiency virus-infected, and malnourished infants). Completion of WHO prequalification of RotaTeq and affordability are also key requirements to routine vaccine introduction. The RotaTeq Partnership with the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health provides an example of the successful introduction of this vaccine into a developing world country.

TI The landscape genetics of infectious disease emergence and spread
AB The spread of parasites is inherently a spatial process often embedded in physically complex landscapes. It is therefore not surprising that infectious disease researchers are increasingly taking a landscape genetics perspective to elucidate mechanisms underlying basic ecological processes driving infectious disease dynamics and to understand the linkage between spatially dependent population processes and the geographic distribution of genetic variation within both hosts and parasites. The increasing availability of genetic information on hosts and parasites when coupled to their ecological interactions can lead to insights for predicting patterns of disease emergence, spread and control. Here, we review research progress in this area based on four different motivations for the application of landscape genetics approaches: (i) assessing the spatial organization of genetic variation in parasites as a function of environmental variability, (ii) using host population genetic structure as a means to parameterize ecological dynamics that indirectly influence parasite populations, for example, gene flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes and the concurrent transport of infectious agents, (iii) elucidating the temporal and spatial scales of disease processes and (iv) reconstructing and understanding infectious disease invasion. Throughout this review, we emphasize that landscape genetic principles are relevant to infection dynamics across a range of scales from within host dynamics to global geographic patterns and that they can also be applied to unconventional 'landscapes' such as heterogeneous contact networks underlying the spread of human and livestock diseases. We conclude by discussing some general considerations and problems for inferring epidemiological processes from genetic data and try to identify possible future directions and applications for this rapidly expanding field.

TI Multiple gains and losses of Wolbachia symbionts across a tribe of
   fungus-growing ants
AB Although the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia is ubiquitous in insects, it has a unique relationship with New World ants on which particular bacterial strains have specialized. However, data are from distantly related hosts and detailed phylogenetic information which could reveal transmission dynamics are lacking. Here, we investigate host-Wolbachia relationships in the monophyletic fungus-growing ant tribe Attini, screening 23 species and using multilocus sequence typing to reliably identify Wolbachia strains. This technique reduces the significant problem of recombination seen using traditional single gene techniques. The relationship between Wolbachia and the fungus-growing ants appears complex and dynamic. There is evidence of co-cladogenesis, supporting vertical transmission; however, this is incomplete, demonstrating that horizontal transmission has also occurred. Importantly, the infection prevalence is frequently different between closely related taxa, with the Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants appearing particularly prone to infection and there being no consistent relationship with any of the major life history transitions. We suggest that infection loss and horizontal transmission have driven epidemics or selective sweeps of Wolbachia, resulting in multiple gains and losses of infection across the fungus-growing ants.

TI Graph-Based Analysis of the Metabolic Exchanges between Two Co-Resident
   Intracellular Symbionts, Baumannia cicadellinicola and Sulcia muelleri,
   with Their Insect Host, Homalodisca coagulata
AB Endosymbiotic bacteria from different species can live inside cells of the same eukaryotic organism. Metabolic exchanges occur between host and bacteria but also between different endocytobionts. Since a complete genome annotation is available for both, we built the metabolic network of two endosymbiotic bacteria, Sulcia muelleri and Baumannia cicadellinicola, that live inside specific cells of the sharpshooter Homalodisca coagulata and studied the metabolic exchanges involving transfers of carbon atoms between the three. We automatically determined the set of metabolites potentially exogenously acquired (seeds) for both metabolic networks. We show that the number of seeds needed by both bacteria in the carbon metabolism is extremely reduced. Moreover, only three seeds are common to both metabolic networks, indicating that the complementarity of the two metabolisms is not only manifested in the metabolic capabilities of each bacterium, but also by their different use of the same environment. Furthermore, our results show that the carbon metabolism of S. muelleri may be completely independent of the metabolic network of B. cicadellinicola. On the contrary, the carbon metabolism of the latter appears dependent on the metabolism of S. muelleri, at least for two essential amino acids, threonine and lysine. Next, in order to define which subsets of seeds (precursor sets) are sufficient to produce the metabolites involved in a symbiotic function, we used a graph-based method, PITUFO, that we recently developed. Our results highly refine our knowledge about the complementarity between the metabolisms of the two bacteria and their host. We thus indicate seeds that appear obligatory in the synthesis of metabolites are involved in the symbiotic function. Our results suggest both B. cicadellinicola and S. muelleri may be completely independent of the metabolites provided by the co-resident endocytobiont to produce the carbon backbone of the metabolites provided to the symbiotic system (i.e., thr and lys are only exploited by B. cicadellinicola to produce its proteins).

TI Insights into the Evolution and Emergence of a Novel Infectious Disease
AB Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza A(H5N1). Adaptation is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained human-to-human transmission. Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if R-0 = 1.4 or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.

TI Quantitative Analysis of Immune Response and Erythropoiesis during
   Rodent Malarial Infection
AB Malarial infection is associated with complex immune and erythropoietic responses in the host. A quantitative understanding of these processes is essential to help inform malaria therapy and for the design of effective vaccines. In this study, we use a statistical model-fitting approach to investigate the immune and erythropoietic responses in Plasmodium chabaudi infections of mice. Three mouse phenotypes (wildtype, T-cell-deficient nude mice, and nude mice reconstituted with T-cells taken from wildtype mice) were infected with one of two parasite clones (AS or AJ). Under a Bayesian framework, we use an adaptive population-based Markov chain Monte Carlo method and fit a set of dynamical models to observed data on parasite and red blood cell (RBC) densities. Model fits are compared using Bayes' factors and parameter estimates obtained. We consider three independent immune mechanisms: clearance of parasitised RBCs (pRBC), clearance of unparasitised RBCs (uRBC), and clearance of parasites that burst from RBCs (merozoites). Our results suggest that the immune response of wildtype mice is associated with less destruction of uRBCs, compared to the immune response of nude mice. There is a greater degree of synchronisation between pRBC and uRBC clearance than between either mechanism and merozoite clearance. In all three mouse phenotypes, control of the peak of parasite density is associated with pRBC clearance. In wildtype mice and AS-infected nude mice, control of the peak is also associated with uRBC clearance. Our results suggest that uRBC clearance, rather than RBC infection, is the major determinant of RBC dynamics from approximately day 12 post-innoculation. During the first 2-3 weeks of blood-stage infection, immune-mediated clearance of pRBCs and uRBCs appears to have a much stronger effect than immune-mediated merozoite clearance. Upregulation of erythropoiesis is dependent on mouse phenotype and is greater in wildtype and reconstitited mice. Our study highlights the informative power of statistically rigorous model-fitting techniques in elucidating biological systems.

TI HIV Promoter Integration Site Primarily Modulates Transcriptional Burst
   Size Rather Than Frequency
AB Mammalian gene expression patterns, and their variability across populations of cells, are regulated by factors specific to each gene in concert with its surrounding cellular and genomic environment. Lentiviruses such as HIV integrate their genomes into semi-random genomic locations in the cells they infect, and the resulting viral gene expression provides a natural system to dissect the contributions of genomic environment to transcriptional regulation. Previously, we showed that expression heterogeneity and its modulation by specific host factors at HIV integration sites are key determinants of infected-cell fate and a possible source of latent infections. Here, we assess the integration context dependence of expression heterogeneity from diverse single integrations of a HIV-promoter/GFP-reporter cassette in Jurkat T-cells. Systematically fitting a stochastic model of gene expression to our data reveals an underlying transcriptional dynamic, by which multiple transcripts are produced during short, infrequent bursts, that quantitatively accounts for the wide, highly skewed protein expression distributions observed in each of our clonal cell populations. Interestingly, we find that the size of transcriptional bursts is the primary systematic covariate over integration sites, varying from a few to tens of transcripts across integration sites, and correlating well with mean expression. In contrast, burst frequencies are scattered about a typical value of several per cell-division time and demonstrate little correlation with the clonal means. This pattern of modulation generates consistently noisy distributions over the sampled integration positions, with large expression variability relative to the mean maintained even for the most productive integrations, and could contribute to specifying heterogeneous, integration-site-dependent viral production patterns in HIV-infected cells. Genomic environment thus emerges as a significant control parameter for gene expression variation that may contribute to structuring mammalian genomes, as well as be exploited for survival by integrating viruses.

TI A Large Repertoire of Parasite Epitopes Matched by a Large Repertoire of
   Host Immune Receptors in an Invertebrate Host/Parasite Model
AB For many decades, invertebrate immunity was believed to be non-adaptive, poorly specific, relying exclusively on sometimes multiple but germ-line encoded innate receptors and effectors. But recent studies performed in different invertebrate species have shaken this paradigm by providing evidence for various types of somatic adaptations at the level of putative immune receptors leading to an enlarged repertoire of recognition molecules. Fibrinogen Related Proteins (FREPs) from the mollusc Biomphalaria glabrata are an example of these putative immune receptors. They are known to be involved in reactions against trematode parasites. Following not yet well understood somatic mechanisms, the FREP repertoire varies considerably from one snail to another, showing a trend towards an individualization of the putative immune repertoire almost comparable to that described from vertebrate adaptive immune system. Nevertheless, their antigenic targets remain unknown. In this study, we show that a specific set of these highly variable FREPs from B. glabrata forms complexes with similarly highly polymorphic and individually variable mucin molecules from its specific trematode parasite S. mansoni (Schistosoma mansoni Polymorphic Mucins: SmPoMucs). This is the first evidence of the interaction between diversified immune receptors and antigenic variant in an invertebrate host/pathogen model. The same order of magnitude in the diversity of the parasite epitopes and the one of the FREP suggests co-evolutionary dynamics between host and parasite regarding this set of determinants that could explain population features like the compatibility polymorphism observed in B. glabrata/S. mansoni interaction. In addition, we identified a third partner associated with the FREPs/SmPoMucs in the immune complex: a Thioester containing Protein (TEP) belonging to a molecular category that plays a role in phagocytosis or encapsulation following recognition. The presence of this last partner in this immune complex argues in favor of the involvement of the formed complex in parasite recognition and elimination from the host.

TI Stage-Specific Adhesion of Leishmania Promastigotes to Sand Fly Midguts
   Assessed Using an Improved Comparative Binding Assay
AB Background: The binding of Leishmania promastigotes to the midgut epithelium is regarded as an essential part of the life-cycle in the sand fly vector, enabling the parasites to persist beyond the initial blood meal phase and establish the infection. However, the precise nature of the promastigote stage(s) that mediate binding is not fully understood.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To address this issue we have developed an in vitro gut binding assay in which two promastigote populations are labelled with different fluorescent dyes and compete for binding to dissected sand fly midguts. Binding of procyclic, nectomonad, leptomonad and metacyclic promastigotes of Leishmania infantum and L. mexicana to the midguts of blood-fed, female Lutzomyia longipalpis was investigated. The results show that procyclic and metacyclic promastigotes do not bind to the midgut epithelium in significant numbers, whereas nectomonad and leptomonad promastigotes both bind strongly and in similar numbers. The assay was then used to compare the binding of a range of different parasite species (L. infantum, L. mexicana, L. braziliensis, L. major, L. tropica) to guts dissected from various sand flies (Lu. longipalpis, Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti). The results of these comparisons were in many cases in line with expectations, the natural parasite binding most effectively to its natural vector, and no examples were found where a parasite was unable to bind to its natural vector. However, there were interesting exceptions: L. major and L. tropica being able to bind to Lu. longipalpis better than L. infantum; L. braziliensis was able to bind to P. papatasi as well as L. major; and significant binding of L. major to P. sergenti and L. tropica to P. papatasi was observed.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results demonstrate that Leishmania gut binding is strictly stage-dependent, is a property of those forms found in the middle phase of development (nectomonad and leptomonad forms), but is absent in the early blood meal and final stages (procyclic and metacyclic forms). Further they show that although gut binding may be necessary for parasite establishment, in several vector-parasite pairs the specificity of such in vitro binding alone is insufficient to explain overall vector specificity. Other significant barriers to development must exist in certain refractory Leishmania parasite-sand fly vector combinations. A re-appraisal of the specificity of the Leishmania-sand fly relationship is required.

TI Global drivers of human pathogen richness and prevalence
AB The differences in the richness and prevalence of human pathogens among different geographical locations have ramifying consequences for societies and individuals. The relative contributions of different factors to these patterns, however, have not been fully resolved. We conduct a global analysis of the relative influence of climate, alternative host diversity and spending on disease prevention on modern patterns in the richness and prevalence of human pathogens. Pathogen richness (number of kinds) is largely explained by the number of birds and mammal species in a region. The most diverse countries with respect to birds and mammals are also the most diverse with respect to pathogens. Importantly, for human health, the prevalence of key human pathogens (number of cases) is strongly influenced by disease control efforts. As a consequence, even where disease richness is high, we might still control prevalence, particularly if we spend money in those regions where current spending is low, prevalence is high and populations are large.

TI Characteristics of Autochthonous Hepatitis E Virus Infection in
   Solid-Organ Transplant Recipients in France
AB Background. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections can lead to chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients. We have investigated the risk factors for HEV infection among solid-organ transplant recipients and the characteristics of these infections.
   Methods. We performed serological tests, quantified the virus, and genotyped the virus in plasma samples. We performed a case-control study with HEV-infected patients and control participants matched for sex and age who were recruited from a population of solid-organ transplant recipients with no markers of HEV infection.
   Results. We investigated 38 consecutive cases of HEV genotype 3 infection. Twenty-two (58%) of these 38 patients developed a chronic infection. The acute-phase aminotransferase levels were higher in the patients who cleared the virus than in those who developed chronic infections. The anti-HEV immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M profiles and HEV RNA concentration in patients who cleared the virus were similar to those in patients who developed a chronic infection. A logistic regression analysis of 37 case patients and 148 control participants indicated that the only factor independently associated with HEV infection was the consumption of game meat (68% of case patients vs 47% of control participants; odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-5.15).
   Conclusion. Immunocompromised patients should avoid eating insufficiently cooked game meat or pork products so as to reduce the risk of HEV infection and chronic liver disease.

TI Community Psychological and Behavioral Responses through the First Wave
   of the 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) Pandemic in Hong Kong
AB Background. Little is known about the community psychological and behavioral responses to influenza pandemics.
   Methods. Using random digit dialing, we sampled 12,965 Hong Kong residents in 13 cross-sectional telephone surveys between April and November 2009, covering the entire first wave of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. We examined trends in anxiety, risk perception, knowledge on modes of transmission, and preventive behaviors.
   Results. Respondents reported low anxiety levels throughout the epidemic. Perceived susceptibility to infection and perceived severity of H1N1 were initially high but declined early in the epidemic and remained stable thereafter. As the epidemic grew, knowledge on modes of transmission did not improve, the adoption of hygiene measures and use of face masks did not change, and social distancing declined. Greater anxiety was associated with lower reported use of hygiene measures but greater social distancing. Knowledge that H1N1 could be spread by indirect contact was associated with greater use of hygiene measures and social distancing.
   Conclusions. The lack of substantial change in preventive measures or knowledge about the modes of H1N1 transmission in the general population suggests that community mitigation measures played little role in mitigating the impact of the first wave of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in Hong Kong.

TI Rural-urban gradient in seasonal forcing of measles transmission in
   Niger
AB Seasonally driven cycles of incidence have been consistently observed for a range of directly transmitted pathogens. Though frequently observed, the mechanism of seasonality for directly transmitted human pathogens is rarely well understood. Despite significant annual variation in magnitude, measles outbreaks in Niger consistently begin in the dry season and decline at the onset of the seasonal rains. We estimate the seasonal fluctuation in measles transmission rates for the 38 districts and urban centres of Niger, from 11 years of weekly incidence reports. We show that transmission rates are consistently in anti-phase to the rainfall patterns across the country. The strength of the seasonal forcing of transmission is not correlated with the latitudinal rainfall gradient, as would be expected if transmission rates were determined purely by environmental conditions. Rather, seasonal forcing is correlated with the population size, with larger seasonal fluctuation in more populous, urban areas. This pattern is consistent with seasonal variation in human density and contact rates due to agricultural cycles. The stronger seasonality in large cities drives deep inter-epidemic troughs and results in frequent local extinction of measles, which contrasts starkly to the conventional observation that large cities, by virtue of their size, act as reservoirs of measles.

TI Ecological factors driving the long-term evolution of influenza's host
   range
AB The evolution of a pathogen's host range is shaped by the ecology of its hosts and by the physiological traits that determine host specificity. For many pathogen traits, there is a trade-off: a phenotype suitable for infecting one set of hosts poorly infects another. Introducing and analysing a simple evo-epidemiological model, here we study how such a trade-off is expected to affect evolution of the host ranges of influenza viruses. We examine a quantitative trait underlying host specificity, given by an influenza virus's degree of adaptation to certain conformations of sialic acid receptors, and investigate how this receptor preference evolves in a minimal network of host species, including humans, that differ in life history and receptor physiology. Using adaptive dynamics theory, we establish thresholds in interspecific transmission rates and host population sizes that govern the emergence and persistence of human-adapted viruses. These ecological thresholds turn out to be largely independent of the strength of the evolutionary trade-off, underscoring the importance of ecological conditions in determining a disease's host range.

TI Chikungunya Virus: A Novel and Potentially Serious Threat to New Zealand
   and the South Pacific Islands
AB There has never been a locally transmitted outbreak of mosquito-borne disease in New Zealand, but the risk of an outbreak occurring is increasing with on-going interceptions of exotic mosquito vectors across its border, increasing traffic of goods and passengers, higher numbers of viremic travelers arriving, and local, regional, and global environmental change. The risk posed to New Zealand by chikungunya virus is potentially high because of the transmissibility of this virus in subtropical climates, compounded by a population that is predominantly immunologically naive to exotic arboviruses. However, risk reduction in New Zealand should not be considered in isolation but must be viewed within a wider South Pacific context. In this report, we discuss the potential threat posed by chikungunya to the region, focusing in particular on New Zealand, and re-emphasizing the need for a South Pacific wide approach towards mosquito-borne disease prevention.

AB Climate and environmental data were used to estimate the risk of testing positive for antibodies to bluetongue (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV) in cattle in Illinois and western Indiana over three transmission seasons (2000-2002). The risks of BTV and EHDV seropositivity were positively associated with temperature during every year of the study. The EHDV seropositivity was also positively associated with forest patchiness in two of the years. During 2002, a year with unusually high spring rainfall, forest patchiness was not significantly associated with EHDV but spring rainfall did have a moderating effect on temperature. Maps of predicted probability of exposure to BTV or EHDV were created using these best-fitting models and show distinctly different spatial patterns within the same cattle population.

TI Genetic Consequences of Mass Human Chemotherapy for Schistosoma mansoni:
   Population Structure Pre- and Post-Praziquantel Treatment in Tanzania
AB Recent shifts in global health policy have led to the implementation of mass drug administration (MDA) for neglected tropical diseases. Here we show how population genetic analyses can provide vital insights into the impact of such MDA on endemic parasite populations. We show that even a single round of MDA produced a genetic bottleneck with reductions in a range of measures of genetic diversity of Schistosoma mansoni. Phylogenetic analyses and indices of population differentiation indicated that schistosomes collected in the same schools in different years were more dissimilar than those from different schools collected within either of the study's 2 years, in addition to distinguishing re-infection from non-clearance (that might indicate putatively resistant parasites) from within those children infected at both baseline and follow-up. Such unique results illustrate the importance of genetic monitoring and examination of long lived multi-cellular parasites such as these under novel or increased chemotherapeutic selective pressures.

TI Critical Interplay between Parasite Differentiation, Host Immunity, and
   Antigenic Variation in Trypanosome Infections
AB Increasing availability of pathogen genomic data offers new opportunities to understand the fundamental mechanisms of immune evasion and pathogen population dynamics during chronic infection. Motivated by the growing knowledge on the antigenic variation system of the sleeping sickness parasite, the African trypanosome, we introduce a mechanistic framework for modeling within-host infection dynamics. Our analysis focuses first on a single parasitemia peak and then on the dynamics of multiple peaks that rely on stochastic switching between groups of parasite variants. A major feature of trypanosome infections is the interaction between variant-specific host immunity and density-dependent parasite differentiation to transmission life stages. In this study, we investigate how the interplay between these two types of control depends on the modular structure of the parasite antigenic archive. Our model shows that the degree of synchronization in stochastic variant emergence determines the relative dominance of general over specific control within a single peak. A requirement for multiple-peak dynamics is a critical switch rate between blocks of antigenic variants, which implies constraints on variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) archive genetic diversification. Our study illustrates the importance of quantifying the links between parasite genetics and within-host dynamics and provides insights into the evolution of trypanosomes.

TI Evolution of Cryptic Coloration in Ectoparasites
AB Cryptic coloration is a classic example of evolution by natural selection. However, it has been studied almost exclusively in predator-prey systems, despite the fact that it may evolve in other groups, such as ectoparasites. The principle defense of hosts against ectoparasites is grooming behavior, which has a visual component. Host-imposed selection should lead to the evolution of background matching if it helps ectoparasites escape from grooming. Here we use sister taxa comparisons to show that avian feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) have evolved coloration that matches the host's plumage, except in the case of head lice, which are protected from grooming. We also show covariation of parasite and host color within a single species of louse. Thus, cryptic coloration has evolved both within and between species of feather lice. Other examples of the evolution of crypsis presumably exist among the 70,000 known species of ectoparasites that collectively represent five animal phyla.

TI Host physiological phenotype explains pathogen reservoir potential
AB Control of emerging infectious diseases often hinges on identifying a pathogen reservoir, the source of disease transmission. The potential to function as a pathogen reservoir can be influenced by host lifespan, geographic provenance and phylogeny. Yet, no study has identified factors that causally determine the reservoir potential of diverse host species. We propose the host physiological phenotype hypothesis, which predicts that hosts with short-lived, poorly defended, nutrient rich and high metabolism tissue have greater values for three epidemiological parameters that determine reservoir potential: host susceptibility to infection, competence to infect vectors and ability to support vector populations. We experimentally tested these predictions using a generalist vectored virus and six wild grass species. Host physiological phenotype explained why hosts differed in all three epidemiological parameters while host lifespan, provenance and phylogeny could not explain host competence. Thus, a single, general axis describing variation in host physiological phenotype may explain reservoir potential.

TI Are parasites ''prudent'' in space?
AB P>There has been a renewed controversy on the processes that determine evolution in spatially structured populations. Recent theoretical and empirical studies have suggested that parasites should be expected to be more ''prudent'' (less harmful and slower transmitting) when infection occurs locally. Using a novel approach based on spatial moment equations, we show that the evolution of parasites in spatially structured host populations is determined by the interplay of genetic and demographic spatial structuring, which in turn depends on the details of the ecological dynamics. This allows a detailed understanding of the roles of epidemiology, demography and network topology. Demographic turnover is needed for local interactions to select for prudence in the susceptible-infected models that have been the focus of previous studies. In diseases with little demographic turnover (as typical of many human diseases), we show that only parasites causing diseases with long-lived immunity are likely to be prudent in space. We further demonstrate why, at intermediate parasite dispersal, virulence can evolve to higher levels than predicted by non-spatial theory.

TI Testing the Janzen-Connell mechanism: pathogens cause overcompensating
   density dependence in a tropical tree
AB P>The Janzen-Connell hypothesis is a leading explanation for plant-species diversity in tropical forests. It suggests that specialized natural enemies decrease offspring survival at high densities beneath parents, giving locally rarer species an advantage. This mechanism, in its original form, assumes that density dependence is overcompensating: mortality must be disproportionately high at the highest densities, with few offspring recruiting below their parents. We tested this assumption using parallel shadehouse and field density-series experiments on seedlings of a tropical tree, Pleradenophora longicuspis. We found strong, overcompensating mortality driven by fungal pathogens, causing 90% (shadehouse) or 100% (field) mortality within 4 weeks of germination, and generating a negative relationship between initial and final seedling densities. Fungicide treatment led to much lower, density-independent, mortality. Overcompensating mortality was extremely rapid, and could be missed without detailed monitoring. Such dynamics may prevent dead trees from being replaced by conspecifics, promoting coexistence as envisioned by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

TI Influenza A (H5N1) Viruses from Pigs, Indonesia
AB Pigs have long been considered potential intermediate hosts in which avian influenza viruses can adapt to humans. To determine whether this potential exists for pigs in Indonesia, we conducted surveillance during 2005-2009. We found that 52 pigs in 4 provinces were infected during 2005-2007 but not 2008-2009. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses had been introduced into the pig population in Indonesia on at least 3 occasions. One isolate had acquired the ability to recognize a human-type receptor. No infected pig had influenza-like symptoms, indicating that influenza A (H5N1) viruses can replicate undetected for prolonged periods, facilitating avian virus adaptation to mammalian hosts. Our data suggest that pigs are at risk for infection during outbreaks of influenza virus A (H5N1) and can serve as intermediate hosts in which this avian virus can adapt to mammals.

TI The Risk of West Nile Virus Infection Is Associated with Combined Sewer
   Overflow Streams in Urban Atlanta, Georgia, USA
AB BACKGROUND: At present, the factors favoring transmission and amplification of West Nile Virus (WNV) within urban environments are poorly understood. In urban Atlanta, Georgia, the highly polluted waters of streams affected by combined sewer overflow (CSO) represent significant habitats for the WNV mosquito vector Culex quinquefasciatus. However, their contribution to the risk of WNV infection in humans and birds remains unclear.
   OBJECTIVES: Our goals were to describe and quantify the spatial distribution of WNV infection in mosquitoes, humans, and corvids, such as blue jays and American crows that are particularly susceptible to WNV infection, and to assess the relationship between WNV infection and proximity to CSO-affected streams in the city of Atlanta, Georgia.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied spatial statistics to human, corvid, and mosquito WNV surveillance data from 2001 through 2007. Multimodel analysis was used to estimate associations of WNV infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus, humans, and dead corvids with selected risk factors including distance to CSO streams and catch basins, land cover, median household income, and housing characteristics.
   RESULTS: We found that WNV infection in mosquitoes, corvids, and humans was spatially clustered and statistically associated with CSO-affected streams. WNV infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus was significantly higher in CSO compared with non-CSO streams, and WNV infection rates among humans and corvids were significantly associated with proximity to CSO-affected streams, the extent of tree cover, and median household income.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study strongly suggests that CSO-affected streams are significant sources of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes that may facilitate WNV transmission to humans within urban environments. Our findings may have direct implications for the surveillance and control of WNV in other urban centers that continue to use CSO systems as a waste management practice.

AB BACKGROUND: Microbial water contamination after periods of heavy rainfall is well described, but its link to acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) in children is not well known.
   OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize an association between rainfall and pediatric emergency department (ED) visits for AGI that may represent an unrecognized, endemic burden of pediatric disease in a major U. S. metropolitan area served by municipal drinking water systems.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective time series analysis of visits to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin ED in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Daily visit totals of discharge International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes of gastroenteritis or diarrhea were collected along with daily rainfall totals during the study period from 2002 to 2007. We used an autoregressive moving average model, adjusting for confounding variables such as sewage release events and season, to look for an association between daily visits and rainfall after a lag of 1-7 days.
   RESULTS: A total of 17,357 AGI visits were identified (mean daily total, 7.9; range, 0-56). Any rainfall 4 days prior was significantly associated with an 11% increase in AGI visits. Expected seasonal effects were also seen, with increased AGI visits in winter months.
   CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant association between rainfall and pediatric ED visits for AGI, suggesting a waterborne component of disease transmission in this population. The observed increase in ED visits for AGI occurred in the absence of any disease outbreaks reported to public health officials in our region, suggesting that rainfall-associated illness may be underestimated. Further study is warranted to better address this association.

TI CHEMOTHERAPY, WITHIN-HOST ECOLOGY AND THE FITNESS OF DRUG-RESISTANT
   MALARIA PARASITES
AB A major determinant of the rate at which drug-resistant malaria parasites spread through a population is the ecology of resistant and sensitive parasites sharing the same host. Drug treatment can significantly alter this ecology by removing the drug-sensitive parasites, leading to competitive release of resistant parasites. Here, we test the hypothesis that the spread of resistance can be slowed by reducing drug treatment and hence restricting competitive release. Using the rodent malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi, we found that low-dose chemotherapy did reduce competitive release. A higher drug dose regimen exerted stronger positive selection on resistant parasites for no detectable clinical gain. We estimated instantaneous selection coefficients throughout the course of replicate infections to analyze the temporal pattern of the strength and direction of within-host selection. The strength of selection on resistance varied through the course of infections, even in untreated infections, but increased immediately following drug treatment, particularly in the high-dose groups. Resistance remained under positive selection for much longer than expected from the half life of the drug. Although there are many differences between mice and people, our data do raise the question whether the aggressive treatment regimens aimed at complete parasite clearance are the best resistance-management strategies for humans.

TI DO VARIABLE COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS EXPLAIN THE POLYMORPHISM OF THE
   DEPENDENCE PHENOTYPE IN THE ASOBARA TABIDA-WOLBACHIA ASSOCIATION?
AB Wolbachia are symbiotic intracellular bacteria, which are classified as reproductive parasites. Although generally facultative, Wolbachia is necessary for Asobara tabida (Hymenoptera), because aposymbiotic females do not produce any offspring. Interestingly, the ovarian phenotype of aposymbiotic females is variable: some females do not produce any eggs, whereas others do produce some eggs, but these are aborted. Here, we show that the ovarian phenotype of aposymbiotic females is highly polymorphic within populations, although dependence remains complete in both cases. We also identified some lines in which aposymbiotic females were able to produce a very few viable offspring, further extending the range of variation observed. These results suggest that various factors actively maintain polymorphism. We demonstrated that Wolbachia is necessary to trigger oogenetic processes, but that the ovarian phenotype was determined by the host only. Phenotypic variation was also correlated with the differential expression of genes controlling iron homeostasis and oxidative stress, which are potentially involved in the evolution of dependence. This suggests that variation in the ovarian phenotype could reflect selection for different levels of compensatory mechanisms in response to Wolbachia infection, and that polymorphism is maintained through selection on different antagonist traits influenced by oxidative stress.

TI IMPACT OF BACTERIAL MUTATION RATE ON COEVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS BETWEEN
   BACTERIA AND PHAGES
AB Mutator bacteria are frequently found in natural populations of bacteria and although coevolution with parasitic viruses (phages) is thought to be one reason for their persistence, it remains unclear how the presence of mutators affects coevolutionary dynamics. We hypothesized that phages must themselves adapt more rapidly or go extinct, in the face of rapidly evolving mutator bacteria. We compared the coevolutionary dynamics of wild-type Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 with a lytic phage to the dynamics of an isogenic mutator of P. fluorescens SBW25 together with the same phage. At the beginning of the experiment both wild-type bacteria and mutator bacteria coevolved with phages. However, mutators rapidly evolved higher levels of sympatric resistance to phages. The phages were unable to "keep-up" with the mutator bacteria, and these rates of coevolution declined to less than the rates of coevolution between the phages and wild-type bacteria. By the end of the experiment, the sympatric resistance of the mutator bacteria was not significantly different to the sympatric resistance of the wild-type bacteria. This suggests that the importance of mutators in the coevolutionary interactions with a particular phage population is likely to be short-lived. More generally, the results demonstrate that coevolving enemies may escape from Red-Queen dynamics.

TI PARALLEL CHANGES IN HOST RESISTANCE TO VIRAL INFECTION DURING 45,000
   GENERATIONS OF RELAXED SELECTION
AB The dynamics of host susceptibility to parasites are often influenced by trade-offs between the costs and benefits of resistance. We assayed changes in the resistance to three viruses in six lines of Escherichia coli that had been evolving for almost 45,000 generations in their absence. The common ancestor of these lines was completely resistant to T6, partially resistant to T6* (a mutant of T6 with altered host range), and sensitive to lambda. None of the populations changed with respect to resistance to T6, whereas all six evolved increased susceptibility to T6*, probably ameliorating a cost of resistance. More surprisingly, however, the majority of lines evolved complete resistance to lambda, despite not encountering that virus during this period. By coupling our results with previous work, we infer that resistance to lambda evolved as a pleiotropic effect of a beneficial mutation that downregulated an unused metabolic pathway. The strong parallelism between the lines implies that selection had almost deterministic effects on the evolution of these patterns of host resistance. The opposite outcomes for resistance to T6* and lambda demonstrate that the evolution of host resistance under relaxed selection cannot be fully predicted by simple trade-off models.

   multi-host-parasite system
AB P>1. Organisms can protect themselves against parasitism by reducing either parasite burden (resistance) or damage caused by parasites at a given burden (tolerance), but little is known about resistance and tolerance to multiple parasites among wild animal populations and species. The fitness effects of parasitism can be broken down into two components: (i) cost of parasite exposure, the difference in fitness between organisms that were not exposed to parasites and those that were exposed but not infected, and (ii) tolerance, the change in host fitness as a function of parasite burden. For amphibians, a taxon that is being decimated by disease, knowing which species and ontogenetic stages are least resistant or least tolerant to which parasites would help target research and management efforts.
   2. We reared American toad (Bufo americanus) and green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles in a common garden environment and quantified survival and trematode burdens after exposure to 20 Echinostoma trivolvis, Ribeiroia ondatrae or plagiorchid trematode cercariae.
   3. All three trematodes caused significant B. americanus mortality, but R. ondatrae was the only species to induce significant mortality of R. clamitans and was the most deadly of the parasites. Young tadpoles had greater parasite-induced mortality than older tadpoles.
   4. Mortality patterns were driven by B. americanus having lower resistance and a higher cost of parasite exposure than R. clamitans, older tadpoles having higher tolerance than younger tadpoles, B. americanus and R. clamitans exhibiting lower resistance and a higher cost of parasite exposure, respectively, to R. ondatrae relative to the other tested trematodes, and skin-penetrating trematodes inducing a higher cost of parasite exposure than non-skin-penetrators. Host size was not predictive of resistance but was a positive predictor of the cost of resistance and tolerance; however, size alone could not fully account for host differences in tolerance.
   5. Interactions among developmental stage and host and trematode species emphasize the plasticity and context-dependency of defence strategies and the importance of considering resistance and tolerance to multiple parasites in wild host species.

TI The effect of rabbit population control programmes on the impact of
   rabbit haemorrhagic disease in south-eastern Australia
AB P>1. The effect of rabbit population density on transmission of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a critical aspect of disease ecology for rabbit control and rabbit conservation. We examined the interaction between rabbit control and spread of RHDV and a non-pathogenic calicivirus (bCV) in Australian wild rabbit populations, and reviewed existing recommendations for control in this context.
   2. Rabbits were sampled at eight pairs of sites; from rabbit populations where densities had been reduced by conventional control and from matching uncontrolled populations. Sites chosen ranged from hot, arid areas where RHDV had greatly reduced rabbit numbers to cooler, higher-rainfall areas where rabbits remained more abundant. Virus activity was implied from antibody profiles in sera of surviving rabbits.
   3. Reducing population density by conventional control had a similar effect on disease transmission despite a seven-fold difference in initial density. Populations reduced by 70% or more had lower RHDV antibody prevalence in juvenile rabbits but not in adult rabbits, indicating that reducing rabbit density slowed but did not stop RHDV transmission. We found no interactions between rabbit control, RHDV and bCV that could be exploited to improve rabbit management.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Delayed RHDV infection in rabbit control sites is likely to be offset by higher mortality in older rabbits, so that conventional rabbit control does not reduce the impact of RHDV on rabbit populations. Only minor changes to delay the timing of summer rabbit control programmes in cooler areas of Australia are necessary to take best advantage of RHDV-induced reduction in rabbit numbers. For conservation management of rabbits in Europe, these findings indicate that RHDV may continue to have a severe impact on rabbit populations that have been reduced to low population density, but also raise the possibility that bCVs might be introduced to rabbit populations to aid their recovery.

TI Co-variation between the intensity of behavioural manipulation and
   parasite development time in an acanthocephalan-amphipod system
AB Pomphorhynchus laevis, a fish acanthocephalan parasite, manipulates the behaviour of its gammarid intermediate host to increase its trophic transmission to the definitive host. However, the intensity of behavioural manipulation is variable between individual gammarids and between parasite populations. To elucidate causes of this variability, we compared the level of phototaxis alteration induced by different parasite sibships from one population, using experimental infections of Gammarus pulex by P. laevis. We used a naive gammarid population, and we carried out our experiments in two steps, during spring and winter. Moreover, we also investigated co-variation between phototaxis (at different stages of infection, 'young' and 'old cystacanth stage') and two other fitness-related traits, infectivity and development time. Three main parameters could explain the parasite intra-population variation in behavioural manipulation. The genetic variation, suggested by the differences between parasite families, was lower than the variation owing to an (unidentified) environmental factor. Moreover, a correlation was found between development rate and the intensity of behavioural change, the fastest growing parasites being unable to induce rapid phototaxis reversal. This suggests that parasites cannot optimize at the same time these two important parameters of their fitness, and this could explain a part of the variation observed in the wild.

TI Alternative parasite development in transmission strategies: how time
   flies!
AB Among parasitic platyhelminths with complex life cycles, it has been well documented that transmission opportunities are the main forces shaping the diversity of life-history traits and parasite developmental strategies. While deviations in the development pathway usually involve shortening of life cycles, their extension may also occur following perception of remaining time by parasites. Polystoma gallieni, the monogenean parasite of Hyla meridionalis, is able to trigger two alternative developmental strategies depending on the physiological stage of the tadpoles upon which larvae attach. The distribution and reproductive outputs of both resulting phenotypes were surveyed to address questions about the dynamics of transmission in natural environments. Because modifications in the completion of life cycles can have drawbacks which may perturb the dynamic equilibrium of the resulting host-parasite systems, experimental infestations were also performed to assess parasite-parasite interactions. Our results suggest that the bladder adult phenotype, which involves transmission between frogs and tadpoles, is supplied secondarily by the branchial phenotype which involves transmission between tadpoles and metamorphs. They also support the occurrence of finely tuned trade-offs between hosts and parasites and highlight positive trends behind the extension of direct life cycles, in which host-derived signals account for the remaining time to achieve parasitic transmission.

TI Symbiont-mediated phenotypic variation without co-evolution in an
   insect-fungus association
AB Recent studies have shown that symbionts can be a source of adaptive phenotypic variation for their hosts. It is assumed that co-evolution between hosts and symbionts underlies these ecologically significant phenotypic traits. We tested this assumption in the ectosymbiotic fungal associate of the gall midge Asteromyia carbonifera. Phylogenetic analysis placed the fungal symbiont within a monophyletic clade formed by Botryosphaeria dothidea, a typically free-living (i.e. not associated with an insect host) plant pathogen. Symbiont isolates from four divergent midge lineages demonstrated none of the patterns common to heritable microbial symbioses, including parallel diversification with their hosts, substitution rate acceleration, or A+T nucleotide bias. Amplified fragment length polymorphism genotyping of the symbiont revealed that within-lineage genetic diversity was not clustered along host population lines. Culture-based experiments demonstrated that the symbiont-mediated variation in gall phenotype is not borne out in the absence of the midge. This study shows that symbionts can be important players in phenotypic variation for their hosts, even in the absence of a co-evolutionary association.

TI Multiple Infections with Seasonal Influenza A Virus Induce
   Cross-Protective Immunity against A(H1N1) Pandemic Influenza Virus in a
   Ferret Model
AB Background. An age bias toward children and young adults has been reported for infection and hospitalizations with pandemic H1N1 influenza (A[H1N1]pdm) in the 2009 and 2010 influenza seasons in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. Serological analysis of prepandemic samples has shown a higher incidence of cross-reactive antibodies to A[H1N1]pdm virus in older populations; conserved T cell epitopes between viruses have been identified. The contribution of preexisting immunity to seasonal influenza to protection against A[H1N1]pdm infection was analyzed in a ferret model.
   Methods. Ferrets were pre-infected with influenza A viruses and/or vaccinated with inactivated influenza viruses with adjuvant. Infection after challenge was assessed by measuring shedding virus, transmission to naive animals, and seroconversion.
   Results. Homologous vaccination reduced the incidence of infection and delayed transmission. Pre-infection with virus induced sterilizing immunity to homologous challenge. One prior infection with seasonal influenza A virus improved clearance of A[H1N1]pdm virus. Prior infection with A[H1N1]pdm virus reduced shedding after seasonal influenza A challenge. Two infections with seasonal influenza A viruses reduced the incidence of infection, the amount and duration of virus shedding, and the frequency of transmission following A[H1N1]pdm challenge.
   Conclusion. These data suggest the reduced incidence and severity of infection with A[H1N1]pdm virus in the adult population during the 2009-2010 influenza season may be a result of previous exposure to seasonal influenza A viruses.

TI Staphylococcus aureus Small-Colony Variants Are Adapted Phenotypes for
   Intracellular Persistence
AB Background. Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen of endovascular diseases, which can take a chronic course with a high relapse rate despite antimicrobial treatment. Thus far, persistent and antibioticrefractory infections have been largely associated with a subpopulation of S. aureus, the small-colony variants (SCVs).
   Methods. In this work, we used endothelial cells to investigate infection with the highly virulent wild-type isolate (6850), 2 stable isogenic SCV phenotypes (hemB mutant IIb13 and JB1), and the complemented mutant.
   Results. All strains were highly invasive in endothelial cells but largely differed in host response induction. Microarray analysis showed that wild-type phenotypes up-regulated a large number of endothelial genes (including genes involved in innate immunity), whereas the SCVs did not cause these dramatic changes. The inflammatory response and cytotoxicity were strongest shortly after infection and largely decreased within the following days, which was accompanied by a fast elimination of intracellular wild-type bacteria. By contrast, SCVs survived within endothelial cells at high numbers.
   Conclusion. S. aureus intracellular persistence via the development of an adapted subpopulation of SCVs most likely represents an important strategy of S. aureus to hide within the host cells, which could be a reservoir for chronic infections.

TI Adaptive Differentiation of Plasmodium falciparum Populations Inferred
   from Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Conferring Drug Resistance
   and from Neutral SNPs
AB Background. Theoretical and experimental data support the geographic differentiation strategy as a valuable tool for detecting loci under selection. In the context of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, few populations have been studied, with limited genomic coverage.
   Methods. We examined geographic differentiation in P. falciparum populations on the basis of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 genes encoding drug resistance determinants, 5 SNPs in 2 genes encoding antigens, and a set of 17 putatively neutral SNPs dispersed on 13 chromosomes. We sampled 326 parasite isolates representing 7 P. falciparum populations from regions with varied levels of malaria transmission (Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Mayotte, Haiti, and the Philippines).
   Results. Frequencies of drug resistance alleles varied considerably among populations (mean F-ST, 0.52). In contrast, allele frequencies varied significantly less for antigenic and neutral SNPs (mean F-ST, 0.16 and 0.24, respectively). This contrasting pattern was more pronounced when only the African populations were considered. Signature of selection was detected for most of the resistant SNPs but not for the antigenic SNPs.
   Conclusion. These data further validate the utility of geographic differentiation for identifying loci under strong positive selection, such as drug resistance loci. This study also provides frequencies of molecular makers of resistance in some overlooked populations.

TI Beyond splitting hares and rabbiting on about major histocompatibility
   complex complexity
AB The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have become the target of choice for studies wishing to examine adaptively important genetic diversity in natural populations. Within Molecular Ecology alone, there have been 71 papers on aspects of MHC evolution over the past few years, with an increasing year on year trend. This focus on the MHC is partly driven by the hypothesized links between MHC gene dynamics and ecologically interesting and relevant traits, such as mate choice and host-parasite interactions. However, an ability to pin down the evolutionary causes and ecological consequences of MHC variation in natural populations has proven challenging and has been hampered by the very issue that is attractive about MHC genes - their high levels of diversity. Linking high levels of MHC diversity to ecological factors in inherently complex natural populations requires a level of experimental design and analytical rigour that is extremely difficult to achieve owing to a plethora of potentially confounding and interacting variables. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Smith et al. (2010) elegantly overcome the challenge of detecting complex interactions in complex systems by using an intricate analytical approach to demonstrate a role for MHC in the reproductive ability of a natural population of the European hare Lepus europaeus (Fig. 1). Also in this issue, Oppelt et al. (2010) demonstrate a role for MHC variation in determining levels of hepatic coccidian infection in the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus (Fig. 2).

TI Novel insights into Haemagglutinin Protease (HAP) gene regulation in
   Vibrio cholerae
AB Quorum sensing is the phenomenon, whereby bacteria use signal molecules to communicate with each other. For example, to establish a successful infection, pathogenic bacteria become virulent only when they reach a certain local concentration in their host. Bassler and others have highlighted the surprising observation that quorum sensing seems to repress Vibrio cholerae virulence factor expression (e.g. cholera toxin), in contrast to what has been observed for virulence gene expression in other bacteria. Here, I present a novel insight that may clarify the way V. cholerae quorum-sensing signals regulate its genes. Chironomids (Diptera; Chironomidae), which occur worldwide and are frequently the insect found most abundantly in fresh water bodies, are natural reservoirs of V. cholerae. Quorum-sensing signals in V. cholerae up-regulate the production of an extracellular enzyme, haemagglutinin protease (HAP), which degrades chironomid egg masses and prevents the eggs from hatching. HAP, therefore, is a virulence factor against chironomids. Indeed, in a survey carried out over the course of a year, V. cholerae and chironomids showed a pattern that mirrored the dynamics of predator-prey populations. Globally, the numbers of chironomids are much larger than those of humans, so quorum-sensing signals of V. cholerae and HAP gene regulation should be understood with regard to their role in chironomids rather than humans. Further research is needed to understand the role of cholera toxin in the environmental existence of V. cholerae.

TI Major histocompatibility complex variation and age-specific endoparasite
   load in subadult European rabbits
AB Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a fundamental role in the vertebrate immune response and are amongst the most polymorphic genes in vertebrate genomes. It is generally agreed that the highly polymorphic nature of the MHC is maintained through host-parasite co-evolution. Two nonexclusive mechanisms of selection are supposed to act on MHC genes: superiority of MHC heterozygous individuals (overdominance) and an advantage for rare MHC alleles. However, the precise mechanisms and their relative importance are still unknown. Here, we examined MHC dependent parasite load in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) from a distinct population with low MHC diversity (three alleles, six genotypes). Using a multivariate approach, we tested for associations of individual MHC class II DRB constitution and the rabbits' intestinal burden with nematodes and coccidia. Rabbits having a particular allele showed lower infestations with hepatic coccidia (E. stiedai). However, a comparison of all six genotypes in the population revealed that carriers of this allele only benefit when they are heterozygous, and furthermore, MHC heterozygosity in general did not affect individual parasite load. In conclusion, this study suggests an immunogenetic basis of European rabbit resistance to hepatic coccidiosis, which can strongly limit survival to maturity in this species. Our study gives a complex picture of MHC-parasite correlations, unveiling the limits of the classical hypotheses of how MHC polymorphism is maintained in natural systems.

TI Endosymbiont metacommunities, mtDNA diversity and the evolution of the
   Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) species complex
AB Bemisia tabaci, an invasive pest that causes crop damage worldwide, is a highly differentiated species complex, divided into biotypes that have mainly been defined based on mitochondrial DNA sequences. Although endosymbionts can potentially induce population differentiation, specialization and indirect selection on mtDNA, studies have largely ignored these influential passengers in B. tabaci, despite as many as seven bacterial endosymbionts have been identified. Here, we investigate the composition of the whole bacterial community in worldwide populations of B. tabaci, together with host genetic differentiation, focusing on the invasive B and Q biotypes. Among 653 individuals studied, more than 95% of them harbour at least one secondary endosymbiont, and multiple infections are very common. In addition, sequence analyses reveal a very high diversity of facultative endosymbionts in B. tabaci, with some bacterial genus being represented by more than one strain. In the B and Q biotypes, nine different strains of bacteria have been identified. The mtDNA-based phylogeny of B. tabaci also reveals a very high nucleotide diversity that partitions the two ITS clades (B and Q) into six CO1 genetic groups. Each genetic group is in linkage disequilibrium with a specific combination of endosymbionts. All together, our results demonstrate the rapid dynamics of the bacterial endosymbiont-host associations at a small evolutionary scale, questioning the role of endosymbiotic communities in the evolution of the Bemisia tabaci species complex and strengthening the need to develop a metacommunity theory of inherited endosymbionts.

TI C6/36 Aedes albopictus Cells Have a Dysfunctional Antiviral RNA
   Interference Response
AB Mosquitoes rely on RNA interference (RNAi) as their primary defense against viral infections. To this end, the combination of RNAi and invertebrate cell culture systems has become an invaluable tool in studying virus-vector interactions. Nevertheless, a recent study failed to detect an active RNAi response to West Nile virus (WNV) infection in C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells, a mosquito cell line frequently used to study arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Therefore, we sought to determine if WNV actively evades the host's RNAi response or if C6/36 cells have a dysfunctional RNAi pathway. C6/36 and Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells were infected with WNV (Flaviviridae), Sindbis virus (SINV, Togaviridae) and La Crosse virus (LACV, Bunyaviridae) and total RNA recovered from cell lysates. Small RNA (sRNA) libraries were constructed and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. In S2 cells, virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) from all three viruses were predominantly 21 nt in length, a hallmark of the RNAi pathway. However, in C6/36 cells, viRNAs were primarily 17 nt in length from WNV infected cells and 26-27 nt in length in SINV and LACV infected cells. Furthermore, the origin (positive or negative viral strand) and distribution (position along viral genome) of S2 cell generated viRNA populations was consistent with previously published studies, but the profile of sRNAs isolated from C6/36 cells was altered. In total, these results suggest that C6/36 cells lack a functional antiviral RNAi response. These findings are analogous to the type-I interferon deficiency described in Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells and suggest that C6/36 cells may fail to accurately model mosquito-arbovirus interactions at the molecular level.

TI Coinfection with Different Trypanosoma cruzi Strains Interferes with the
   Host Immune Response to Infection
AB A century after the discovery of Trypanosoma cruzi in a child living in Lassance, Minas Gerais, Brazil in 1909, many uncertainties remain with respect to factors determining the pathogenesis of Chagas disease ( CD). Herein, we simultaneously investigate the contribution of both host and parasite factors during acute phase of infection in BALB/c mice infected with the JG and/or CL Brener T. cruzi strains. JG single infected mice presented reduced parasitemia and heart parasitism, no mortality, levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, CCL2, IL-6 and IFN-gamma) similar to those found among naive animals and no clinical manifestations of disease. On the other hand, CL Brener single infected mice presented higher parasitemia and heart parasitism, as well as an increased systemic release of pro-inflammatory mediators and higher mortality probably due to a toxic shock-like systemic inflammatory response. Interestingly, coinfection with JG and CL Brener strains resulted in intermediate parasitemia, heart parasitism and mortality. This was accompanied by an increase in the systemic release of IL-10 with a parallel increase in the number of MAC-3(+) and CD4(+) T spleen cells expressing IL-10. Therefore, the endogenous production of IL-10 elicited by coinfection seems to be crucial to counterregulate the potentially lethal effects triggered by systemic release of pro-inflammatory mediators induced by CL Brener single infection. In conclusion, our results suggest that the composition of the infecting parasite population plays a role in the host response to T. cruzi in determining the severity of the disease in experimentally infected BALB/c mice. The combination of JG and CL Brener was able to trigger both protective inflammatory immunity and regulatory immune mechanisms that attenuate damage caused by inflammation and disease severity in BALB/c mice.

TI Chagas Disease Risk in Texas
AB Background: Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a serious public health concern in many areas of Latin America, including Mexico. It is also endemic in Texas with an autochthonous canine cycle, abundant vectors (Triatoma species) in many counties, and established domestic and peridomestic cycles which make competent reservoirs available throughout the state. Yet, Chagas disease is not reportable in Texas, blood donor screening is not mandatory, and the serological profiles of human and canine populations remain unknown. The purpose of this analysis was to provide a formal risk assessment, including risk maps, which recommends the removal of these lacunae.
   Methods and Findings: The spatial relative risk of the establishment of autochthonous Chagas disease cycles in Texas was assessed using a five-stage analysis. 1. Ecological risk for Chagas disease was established at a fine spatial resolution using a maximum entropy algorithm that takes as input occurrence points of vectors and environmental layers. The analysis was restricted to triatomine vector species for which new data were generated through field collection and through collation of post-1960 museum records in both Mexico and the United States with sufficiently low georeferenced error to be admissible given the spatial resolution of the analysis (1 arc-minute). The new data extended the distribution of vector species to 10 new Texas counties. The models predicted that Triatoma gerstaeckeri has a large region of contiguous suitable habitat in the southern United States and Mexico, T. lecticularia has a diffuse suitable habitat distribution along both coasts of the same region, and T. sanguisuga has a disjoint suitable habitat distribution along the coasts of the United States. The ecological risk is highest in south Texas. 2. Incidence-based relative risk was computed at the county level using the Bayesian Besag-York-Mollie model and post-1960 T. cruzi incidence data. This risk is concentrated in south Texas. 3. The ecological and incidence-based risks were analyzed together in a multi-criteria dominance analysis of all counties and those counties in which there were as yet no reports of parasite incidence. Both analyses picked out counties in south Texas as those at highest risk. 4. As an alternative to the multi-criteria analysis, the ecological and incidence-based risks were compounded in a multiplicative composite risk model. Counties in south Texas emerged as those with the highest risk. 5. Risk as the relative expected exposure rate was computed using a multiplicative model for the composite risk and a scaled population county map for Texas. Counties with highest risk were those in south Texas and a few counties with high human populations in north, east, and central Texas showing that, though Chagas disease risk is concentrated in south Texas, it is not restricted to it.
   Conclusions: For all of Texas, Chagas disease should be designated as reportable, as it is in Arizona and Massachusetts. At least for south Texas, lower than 30 degrees N, blood donor screening should be mandatory, and the serological profiles of human and canine populations should be established. It is also recommended that a joint initiative be undertaken by the United States and Mexico to combat Chagas disease in the trans-border region. The methodology developed for this analysis can be easily exported to other geographical and disease contexts in which risk assessment is of potential value.

TI Unforeseen Costs of Cutting Mosquito Surveillance Budgets
AB A budget proposal to stop the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding in surveillance and research for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus has the potential to leave the country ill-prepared to handle new emerging diseases and manage existing ones. In order to demonstrate the consequences of such a measure, if implemented, we evaluated the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics (a likely scenario emerging from the proposed CDC budget cut) in an economically developed urban environment. We used a mathematical model to generate hypothetical scenarios of delayed response to a dengue introduction (a consequence of halted mosquito surveillance) in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. We then coupled the results of such a model with mosquito surveillance and case management costs to estimate the cumulative costs of each response scenario. Our study shows that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude in comparison to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. Our analysis shows that the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the ones needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without consideration of the cost in human lives and well-being. More specifically, our findings provide a science-based justification for the re-assessment of the current proposal to slash the budget of the CDC vector-borne diseases program, and emphasize the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance.

TI West Nile Virus Monitoring of Migratory and Resident Birds in Germany
AB West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus naturally circulating in wild bird populations. The virus is also capable to infect a broad range of vertebrate species. Humans and equines are highly susceptible and can develop mild flu-like illnesses as well as severe encephalitis leading to fatalities. Most recently, WNV was found to circulate in countries close to Germany, such as France, Czech Republic, Italy, Austria, and Hungary. Given this epidemiological situation its spread to Germany cannot be ruled out. As no data on the WNV situation were available for Germany for the most recent past, we have conducted a serological survey to reveal WNV antibodies in wild birds. More than 2700 blood samples from migratory and resident birds representing 72 species that were collected during 2005-2009 were tested using an immunofluorescence assay and partly by micro-virus neutralization test. By immunofluorescence assay WNV-reactive antibodies could be demonstrated in 11 wild bird species. Similarly, WNV-neutralizing antibodies were revealed in migratory birds belonging to 10 species, but not in resident birds. According to the absence of WNV-reactive antibodies in resident birds and the absence of WNV-specific RNA in all investigated bird samples, there is currently no evidence for a WNV circulation in Germany.

Microneutralization assay was applied in six positive samples. Four (4/392, 1.02%) were found positive for WNV-neutralizing antibodies. None of the positive individuals had a history of travel in endemic area or flavivirus vaccination, suggesting that WNV, or an antigenically related flavivirus, circulates in an endemic sylvatic cycle, at least locally, in rural areas in Greece. Human, animal, and vector surveillance systems have to be implemented to provide an early detection of WNV activity in Greece.

   Valley Fever Virus Field Isolates
AB The increasing interest in Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and its potential impact on naive animal populations deserve revisiting experimental reproduction of RVFV infection, particularly in those animal breeds for which no data about their susceptibility to RVFV infection have ever been recorded. In this study we show the susceptibility of 9-10 weeks old European sheep (Ripollesa breed) to RVFV infection, showing a mild, subacute form of disease. Four different viral isolates efficiently replicated in vivo after subcutaneous experimental inoculation, and consistent viral loads in blood and virus shedding (variable in length depending on the RVFV isolate used) were detected, showing horizontal transmission to a noninfected, sentinel lamb. RVFV infection caused transient pyrexia in adult lambs and no other clinical symptoms were observed, with the exception of corneal opacity ("blue eye") found in 3 out of 16 subcutaneously inoculated sheep. In conclusion, adult sheep from this European breed are readily infected with RVFV without apparent clinical manifestations.

TI Identification of In Vivo-Induced Conserved Sequences from Yersinia
   pestis During Experimental Plague Infection in the Rabbit
AB In an effort to identify the novel virulence determinants of Yersinia pestis, we applied the gene "discovery'' methodology, in vivo-induced (IVI) antigen technology, to detect genes upregulated during infection in a laboratory rabbit model for bubonic plague. After screening over 70,000 Escherichia coli clones of Y. pestis DNA expression libraries, products from 25 loci were identified as being seroreactive to reductively adsorbed, pooled immune serum. Upon sequence analysis of the predicted IVI gene products, more frequently encountered conserved protein functional categories have emerged, to include type-V autotransporters and components of more complex secretion systems including types III and VI. The recombinant products from eight selected clones were subsequently immunoblotted against pooled immune serum from two naturally infected host species: the prairie dog, and a species refractory to lethal disease, the coyote. Immune prairie dog serum recognized 2-3 of the rabbit-reactive antigens, suggesting at least some overlap in the pathogen's in vivo survival mechanisms between these two hosts. Although the coyote serum failed to recognize most of the IVI antigens, LepA was universally reactive with all three host sera. Collectively, the profiles/patterns of IVI conserved sequences (IVICS) may represent immune "signatures'' among different host species, possessing the potential for use as a diagnostic tool for plague. Further, the antigenic nature of IVICS makes them ideal for further evaluation as novel subunit vaccine candidates. The gathering of additional data and analysis of the intact IVI genes and the expressed IVICS products should provide insight into the unique biologic processes of Y. pestis during infection and reveal the genetic patterns of the pathogen's survival strategy in different hosts.

TI Effects of Temperature and Rainfall on the Activity and Dynamics of
   Host-Seeking Aedes albopictus Females in Northern Italy
AB The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, has colonized nearly all the regions of Italy as well as other areas of Europe. During the summer of 2007 the tiger mosquito was responsible for an outbreak of Chikungunya in Italy, when this virus was brought in by a tourist of Indian origin returning from an endemic area. To increase the knowledge of tiger mosquito population dynamics, a survey was carried out from April to November 2008 in the municipalities of Arco and Riva del Garda (northern Italy) through a Biogents Sentinel (TM) (BG)-trap sampling. In particular, the aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of temperature and rainfall on the activity and dynamics of A. albopictus host-seeking females. The seasonal emergence of host-seeking females was strongly influenced by the minimum temperature, and a lower threshold of 13 degrees C was identified. In addition, the threshold for the end of adult activity was found at a minimum temperature of 9 degrees C. Host-seeking female abundance was positively affected by the accumulated temperatures over the period 3 and 4 weeks before the sampling week, possibly as a consequence of the positive effect of accumulated temperatures on larval density. Instead, accumulated precipitation over 1-4 weeks before sampling was negatively correlated with host-seeking female abundance. Finally, the activity of host-seeking females, estimated by the weekly increment in female abundance, was positively affected by the total abundance of females and by mean weekly temperatures. Our study provides useful information for predicting the dynamics of host-seeking Ae. albopictus females in northern Italy and for designing control strategies for preventing arbovirus outbreaks in areas colonized by Ae. albopictus.

TI Informing Optimal Environmental Influenza Interventions: How the Host,
   Agent, and Environment Alter Dominant Routes of Transmission
AB Influenza can be transmitted through respirable (small airborne particles), inspirable (intermediate size), direct-droplet-spray, and contact modes. How these modes are affected by features of the virus strain (infectivity, survivability, transferability, or shedding profiles), host population (behavior, susceptibility, or shedding profiles), and environment (host density, surface area to volume ratios, or host movement patterns) have only recently come under investigation. A discrete-event, continuous-time, stochastic transmission model was constructed to analyze the environmental processes through which a virus passes from one person to another via different transmission modes, and explore which factors increase or decrease different modes of transmission. With the exception of the inspiratory route, each route on its own can cause high transmission in isolation of other modes. Mode-specific transmission was highly sensitive to parameter values. For example, droplet and respirable transmission usually required high host density, while the contact route had no such requirement. Depending on the specific context, one or more modes may be sufficient to cause high transmission, while in other contexts no transmission may result. Because of this, when making intervention decisions that involve blocking environmental pathways, generic recommendations applied indiscriminately may be ineffective; instead intervention choice should be contextualized, depending on the specific features of people, virus strain, or venue in question.

TI The Detection of Acute HIV Infection
AB Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AHI) can be defined as the time from HIV acquisition until seroconversion. Incident HIV infection is less well defined but comprises the time from the acquisition of HIV (acute infection) through seroconversion (early or primary HIV infection) and the following months until infection has been well established, as characterized by a stable HIV viral load (viral load set point) and evolution of antibodies with increased concentration and affinity for HIV antigens. During AHI, a viral latent pool reservoir develops, the immune system suffers irreparable damage, and the infected (often unsuspecting) host may be most contagious. It has proved very difficult to find individuals with AHI either in longitudinal cohorts of subjects at high risk for acquiring the virus or through cross-sectional screening, and the opportunity for diagnosis is generally missed during this phase. We review the technical strategies for identifying individuals with acute or incident HIV infection. We conclude that further technical advances are essential to allow more widespread detection of patients with AHI and to affect HIV treatment outcomes and transmission prevention.

TI Experimental evidence that source genetic variation drives pathogen
   emergence
AB A pathogen can readily mutate to infect new host types, but this does not guarantee successful establishment in the new habitat. What factors, then, dictate emergence success? One possibility is that the pathogen population cannot sustain itself on the new host type (i.e. host is a sink), but migration from a source population allows adaptive sustainability and eventual emergence by delivering beneficial mutations sampled from the source's standing genetic variation. This idea is relevant regardless of whether the sink host is truly novel (host shift) or whether the sink is an existing or related, similar host population thriving under conditions unfavourable to pathogen persistence (range expansion). We predicted that sink adaptation should occur faster under range expansion than during a host shift owing to the effects of source genetic variation on pathogen adaptability in the sink. Under range expansion, source migration should benefit emergence in the sink because selection acting on source and sink populations is likely to be congruent. By contrast, during host shifts, source migration is likely to disrupt emergence in the sink owing to uncorrelated selection or performance tradeoffs across host types. We tested this hypothesis by evolving bacteriophage populations on novel host bacteria under sink conditions, while manipulating emergence via host shift versus range expansion. Controls examined sink adaptation when unevolved founding genotypes served as migrants. As predicted, adaptability was fastest under range expansion, and controls did not adapt. Large, similar and similarly timed increases in fitness were observed in the host-shift populations, despite declines in mean fitness of immigrants through time. These results suggest that source populations are the origin of mutations that drive adaptive emergence at the edge of a pathogen's ecological or geographical range.

TI Evolution towards oscillation or stability in a predator-prey system
AB We studied a prey-predator system in which both species evolve. We discuss here the conditions that result in coevolution towards a stable equilibrium or towards oscillations. First, we show that a stable equilibrium or population oscillations with small amplitude is likely to occur if the prey's (host's) defence is effective when compared with the predator's (parasite's) attacking ability at equilibrium, whereas large-amplitude oscillations are likely if the predator's (parasite's) attacking ability exceeds the prey's (host's) defensive ability. Second, a stable equilibrium is more likely if the prey's defensive trait evolves faster than the predator's attack trait, whereas population oscillations are likely if the predator's trait evolves faster than that of the prey. Third, when the adaptation rates of both species are similar, the amplitude of the fluctuations in their abundances is small when the adaptation rate is either very slow or very fast, but at an intermediate rate of adaptation the fluctuations have a large amplitude. We also show the case in which the prey's abundance and trait fluctuate greatly, while those of the predator remain almost unchanged. Our results predict that populations and traits in host-parasite systems are more likely than those in prey-predator systems to show large-amplitude oscillations.

TI Variation in Resource Acquisition and Use among Host Clones Creates Key
   Epidemiological Trade-Offs
AB Parasites can certainly harm host fitness. Given such virulence, hosts should evolve strategies to resist or tolerate infection. But what governs those strategies and the costs that they incur? This study illustrates how a fecundity-susceptibility trade-off among clonally reared genotypes of a zooplankton (Daphnia dentifera) infected by a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia) arises due to variation in resource acquisition and use by hosts. To make these connections, we used lab experiments and theoretical models that link feeding with susceptibility, energetics, and fecundity of hosts. These feeding-based mechanisms also produced a fecundity-survivorship trade-off. Meanwhile, a parasite spore yield-fecundity trade-off arose from variation in juvenile growth rate among host clones (another index of resource use), a result that was readily anticipated and explained by the models. Thus, several key epidemiological trade-offs stem from variation in resource acquisition and use among clones. This connection should catalyze the creation of new theory that integrates resource- and gene-based responses of hosts to disease.

TI Hidden Consequences of Living in a Wormy World: Nematode-Induced Immune
   Suppression Facilitates Tuberculosis Invasion in African Buffalo
AB Most hosts are infected with multiple parasites, and responses of the immune system to co occurring parasites may influence disease spread. Helminth infection can bias the host immune response toward a T-helper type 2 Th2) over a type 1 Th1) response, impairing the host's ability to control concurrent intracellular microparasite infections and potentially modifying disease dynamics. In humans, immune-mediated interactions between helminths and microparasites can alter host susceptibility to diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis TB), and malaria. However, the extent to which similar processes operate in natural animal populations and influence disease spread remains unknown. We used cross-sectional, experimental, and genetic studies to show that gastrointestinal nematode infection alters immunity to intracellular microparasites in free-ranging African buffalo Syncerus caffer). Buffalo that were more resistant to nematode infection had weaker Th1 responses, there was significant genotypic variation in nematode resistance, and anthelminthic treatment enhanced Th1 immunity. Using a disease dynamic model parameterized with empirical data, we found that nematode-induced immune suppression can facilitate the invasion of bovine TB in buffalo. In the absence of nematodes, TB failed to invade the system, illustrating the critical role nematodes may play in disease establishment. Our results suggest that helminths, by influencing the likelihood of microparasite invasion, may influence patterns of disease emergence in the wild.

TI Temporal, spatial, and between-host comparisons of patterns of
   parasitism in lake zooplankton
AB In nature, multiple parasite species infect multiple host species and are influenced by processes operating across different spatial and temporal scales. Data sets incorporating these complexities offer exciting opportunities to examine factors that shape epidemics. We present a method using generalized linear mixed models in a multilevel modeling framework to analyze patterns of variances and correlations in binomially distributed prevalence data. We then apply it to a multi-lake, multiyear data set involving two Daphnia host species and nine microparasite species. We found that the largest source of variation in parasite prevalence was the species identities of host-parasite pairs, indicating strong host-parasite specificity. Within host-parasite combinations, spatial variation (among lakes) exceeded interannual variation. This suggests that factors promoting differences among lakes (e. g., habitat characteristics and species interactions) better explain variation in peak infection prevalence in our data set than factors driving differences among years (e. g., climate). Prevalences of parasites in D. dentifera were more positively correlated than those for D. pulicaria, suggesting that similar factors influenced epidemic size among parasites in D. dentifera. Overall, this study demonstrates a method for parsing patterns of variation and covariation in infection prevalence data, providing greater insight into the relative importance of different underlying drivers of parasitism.

TI Genetic Structure of Plasmodium falciparum and Elimination of Malaria,
   Comoros Archipelago
AB The efficacy of malaria control and elimination on islands may depend on the intensity of new parasite inflow. On the Comoros archipelago, where falciparum malaria remains a major public health problem because of spread of drug resistance and insufficient malaria control, recent interventions for malaria elimination were planned on Moheli, 1 of 4 islands in the Comoros archipelago. To assess the relevance of such a local strategy, we performed a population genetics analysis by using multilocus microsatellite and resistance genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum sampled from each island of the archipelago. We found a contrasted population genetic structure explained by geographic isolation, human migration, malaria transmission, and drug selective pressure. Our findings suggest that malaria elimination interventions should be implemented simultaneously on the entire archipelago rather than restricted to 1 island and demonstrate the necessity for specific chemoresistance surveillance on each of the 4 Comorian islands.

Of 1,970 passengers and 734 crew members, 82 (3.0%) were infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, 98 (3.6%) with influenza A (H3N2) virus, and 2 (0.1%) with both. Among 45 children who visited the ship's childcare center, infection rate for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was higher than that for influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Disembarked passengers reported a high level of compliance with isolation and quarantine recommendations. We found 4 subsequent cases epidemiologically linked to passengers but no evidence of sustained transmission to the community or passengers on the next cruise. Among this population of generally healthy passengers, children seemed more susceptible to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 than to influenza (H3N2) viruses. Intensive disease control measures successfully contained these outbreaks.

TI Artificial Lighting as a Vector Attractant and Cause of Disease
   Diffusion
AB BACKGROUND: Traditionally, epidemiologists have considered electrification to be a positive factor. In fact, electrification and plumbing are typical initiatives that represent the integration of an isolated population into modern society, ensuring the control of pathogens and promoting public health. Nonetheless, electrification is always accompanied by night lighting that attracts insect vectors and changes people's behavior. Although this may lead to new modes of infection and increased transmission of insect-borne diseases, epidemiologists rarely consider the role of night lighting in their surveys.
   OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the epidemiological evidence concerning the role of lighting in the spread of vector-borne diseases to encourage other researchers to consider it in future studies.
   DISCUSSION: We present three infectious vector-borne diseases-Chagas, leishmaniasis, and malaria-and discuss evidence that suggests that the use of artificial lighting results in behavioral changes among human populations and changes in the prevalence of vector species and in the modes of transmission.
   CONCLUSION: Despite a surprising lack of studies, existing evidence supports our hypothesis that artificial lighting leads to a higher risk of infection from vector-borne diseases. We believe that this is related not only to the simple attraction of traditional vectors to light sources but also to changes in the behavior of both humans and insects that result in new modes of disease transmission. Considering the ongoing expansion of night lighting in developing countries, additional research on this subject is urgently needed.

TI Potential Influence of Climate Change on Vector-Borne and Zoonotic
   Diseases: A Review and Proposed Research Plan
AB BACKGROUND: Because of complex interactions of climate variables at the levels of the pathogen, vector, and host, the potential influence of climate change on vector-borne and zoonotic diseases (VBZDs) is poorly understood and difficult to predict. Climate effects on the nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases are especially obscure and have received scant treatment.
   OBJECTIVE: We described known and potential effects of climate change on VBZDs and proposed specific studies to increase our understanding of these effects. The nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases have received scant treatment and are emphasized in this paper.
   DATA SOURCES AND SYNTHESIS: We used a review of the existing literature and extrapolations from observations of short-term climate variation to suggest potential impacts of climate change on VBZDs. Using public health priorities on climate change, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we developed six specific goals for increasing understanding of the interaction between climate and VBZDs and for improving capacity for predicting climate change effects on incidence and distribution of VBZDs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Climate change may affect the incidence of VBZDs through its effect on four principal characteristics of host and vector populations that relate to pathogen transmission to humans: geographic distribution, population density, prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens, and the pathogen load in individual hosts and vectors. These mechanisms may interact with each other and with other factors such as anthropogenic disturbance to produce varying effects on pathogen transmission within host and vector populations and to humans. Because climate change effects on most VBZDs act through wildlife hosts and vectors, understanding these effects will require multi-disciplinary teams to conduct and interpret ecosystem-based studies of VBZD pathogens in host and vector populations and to identify the hosts, vectors, and pathogens with the greatest potential to affect human populations under climate change scenarios.

TI Impact of a Citywide Sanitation Program in Northeast Brazil on
   Intestinal Parasites Infection in Young Children
AB BACKGROUND: Sanitation affects health, especially that of young children. Residents of Salvador, in Northeast Brazil, have had a high prevalence of intestinal parasites. A citywide sanitation intervention started in 1996 aimed to raise the level of sewer coverage from 26% to 80% of households.
   OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the impact of this intervention on the prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichuria, and Giardia duodenalis infections in preschool children.
   METHODS: The evaluation was composed of two cross-sectional studies (1998 and 2003-2004), each of a sample of 681 and 976 children 1-4 years of age, respectively. Children were sampled from 24 sentinel areas chosen to represent the range of environmental conditions in the study site. Data were collected using an individual/household questionnaire, and an environmental survey was conducted in each area before and after the intervention to assess basic household and neighborhood sanitation conditions. Stool samples were examined for the presence of intestinal parasites. The effect of the intervention was estimated by hierarchical modeling, fitting a sequence of multivariate regression models.
   FINDINGS: The prevalence of A. lumbricoides infection was reduced from 24.4% to 12.0%, T. trichuria from 18.0% to 5.0%, and G. duodenalis from 14.1% to 5.3%. Most of this reduction appeared to be explained by the increased coverage in each neighborhood by the sewage system constructed during the intervention. The key explanatory variable was thus an ecological measure of exposure and not household-based, suggesting that the parasite transmission prevented by the program was mainly in the public (vs. the domestic) domain.
   CONCLUSION: This study, using advanced statistical modeling to control for individual and ecological potential confounders, demonstrates the impact on intestinal parasites of sanitation improvements implemented at the scale of a large population.

TI Characterization of pseudorabies virus of wild boar origin from Europe
AB Pseudorabies virus (PrV) infections appear to be more widely distributed in the European wild boar (Sus scrofa) population than assumed. In Europe, attempts to isolate and characterize the causative agents have been limited so far. We therefore collected and examined a total of 35 PrV isolates obtained from wild boar or hunting dogs in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Slovakia and Hungary between 1993 and 2008. Restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA using BamHI showed that all isolates, except one, belonged to genogroup I but different subtypes were evident. For further investigations of the phylogenetic relationships, a 732-bp fragment of the glycoprotein C (gC) gene was amplified by PCR. Sequence analysis revealed about 40 variant positions within this fragment. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences supported the separation into a clade containing isolates from North-Rhine Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), France and Spain (clade B) and an apparently more variable clade comprising isolates from Brandenburg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt (Germany), Slovakia, Hungary, Italy and France (clade A).

AB In 2005, a serological study was carried out on horses in five ecologically contrasted zones of the Senegal River basin (Senegal) to assess West Nile virus (WNV) transmission and investigate underlying environmental risk factors. In each study zone, horses were randomly selected and blood samples taken. A land-cover map of the five study areas was built using two satellite ETM+ images. Blood samples were screened by ELISA for anti-WNV IgM and IgG and positive samples were confirmed by seroneutralization. Environmental data were analysed using a principal components analysis. The overall IgG seroprevalence rate was 85% (n=367; 95% CI 0.81-0.89). The proximity to sea water, flooded banks and salted mudflats were identified as protective factors. These environmental components are unfavourable to the presence of Culex mosquitoes suggesting that in Senegal, the distribution of the vector species is more limiting for WNV transmission than for the hosts' distribution.

TI ROLE OF EVOLVED HOST BREADTH IN THE INITIAL EMERGENCE OF AN RNA VIRUS
AB Understanding how evolution promotes pathogen emergence would aid disease management, and prediction of future host shifts. Increased pathogen infectiousness of different hosts may occur through direct selection, or fortuitously via indirect selection. However, it is unclear which type of selection tends to produce host breadth promoting pathogen emergence. We predicted that direct selection for host breadth should foster emergence by causing higher population growth on new hosts, lower among-population variance in growth on new hosts, and lower population variance in growth across new hosts. We tested the predictions using experimentally evolved vesicular stomatitis virus populations, containing groups of host-use specialists, directly selected generalists, and indirectly selected generalists. In novel-host challenges, viruses directly selected for generalism showed relatively higher or equivalent host growth, lower among-population variance in host growth, and lower population variance in growth across hosts. Thus, two of three outcomes supported our prediction that directly selected host breadth should favor host colonization. Also, we observed that indirectly selected generalists were advantaged over specialist viruses, indicating that fortuitous changes in host breadth may also promote emergence. We discuss evolution of phenotypic plasticity versus environmental robustness in viruses, virus avoidance of extinction, and surveillance of pathogen niche breadth to predict future likelihood of emergence.

TI Higher parasite resistance in Daphnia populations with recent epidemics
AB Natural populations often show genetic variation in parasite resistance, forming the basis for evolutionary response to selection imposed by parasitism. We investigated whether previous epidemics selected for higher resistance to novel parasite isolates in a Daphnia galeata-microparasite system by comparing susceptibility of host clones from populations with varying epidemic history. We manipulated resource availability to evaluate whether diet influences Daphnia susceptibility as epidemics are common in nutrient-rich lakes. Exposing clones from 10 lakes under two food treatments to an allopatric protozoan parasite, we found that Daphnia originating from lakes (mainly nutrient rich) with previous epidemics better resist infection. Despite this result, there was a tendency of higher susceptibility in the low food treatment, suggesting that higher resistance of clones from populations with epidemic background is not directly caused by lake nutrient level. Rather, our results imply that host populations respond to parasite-mediated selection by evolving higher parasite resistance.

TI Mobile DNA can drive lineage extinction in prokaryotic populations
AB Natural selection ultimately acts on genes and other DNA sequences. Adaptations that are good for the gene can have adverse effects at higher levels of organization, including the individual or the population. Mobile genetic elements illustrate this principle well, because they can self-replicate within a genome at a cost to their host. As they are costly and can be transmitted horizontally, mobile elements can be seen as genomic parasites. It has been suggested that mobile elements may cause the extinction of their host populations. In organisms with very large populations, such as most bacteria, individual selection is highly effective in purging genomes of deleterious elements, suggesting that extinction is unlikely. Here we investigate the conditions under which mobile DNA can drive bacterial lineages to extinction. We use a range of epidemiological and ecological models to show that harmful mobile DNA can invade, and drive populations to extinction, provided their transmission rate is high and that mobile element-induced mortality is not too high. Population extinction becomes more likely when there are more elements in the population. Even if elements are costly, extinction can still occur because of the combined effect of horizontal gene transfer, a mortality induced by mobile elements. Our study highlights the potential of mobile DNA to be selected at the population level, as well as at the individual level.

TI Selection for thermostability can lead to the emergence of mutational
   robustness in an RNA virus
AB Mutational robustness has important evolutionary implications, yet the mechanisms leading to its emergence remain poorly understood. One possibility is selection acting on a correlated trait, as for instance thermostability (plastogenetic congruence). Here, we examine the correlation between mutational robustness and thermostability in experimental populations of the RNA bacteriophage Q beta. Thermostable viruses evolved after only six serial passages in the presence of heat shocks, and genome sequencing suggested that thermostability can be conferred by several alternative mutations. To test whether thermostable viruses have increased mutational robustness, we performed additional passages in the presence of nitrous acid. Whereas in control lines this treatment produced the expected reduction in growth rate caused by the accumulation of deleterious mutations, thermostable viruses showed no such reduction, indicating that they are more resistant to mutagenesis. Our results suggest that selection for thermostability can lead to the emergence of mutational robustness driven by plastogenetic congruence. As temperature is a widespread selective pressure in nature, the mechanism described here may be relevant to the evolution of mutational robustness.

TI Sex and Geographic Patterns of Human Herpesvirus 8 Infection in a
   Nationally Representative Population-Based Sample in Uganda
AB Background. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), the infectious cause of Kaposi sarcoma, varies dramatically across Africa, suggesting that cofactors correlated with large-area geographic or environmental characteristics may influence risk of infection. Variation in HHV8 seropositivity across small-area regions within countries in Africa is unknown. We investigated this issue in Uganda, where Kaposi sarcoma distribution is uneven and well described.
   Methods. Archival samples from individuals aged 15-59 years randomly selected from a nationally representative 2004-2005 human immunodeficiency virus-AIDS serobehavioral survey were tested for HHV8 seropositivity with use of enzyme immunoassays based on synthetic peptides from the K8.1 and orf65 viral genes. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of association of HHV8 seropositivity with demographic risk factors were estimated.
   Results. Among 2681 individuals tested, HHV8 seropositivity was 55.4%. HHV8 seropositivity was lower in female than in male persons (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69-0.97]) and increased 2.2% (95% CI, 1.0%-3.6%) in female persons and 1.2% (95% CI, 1.0%-2.3%) in male persons per year of age. HHV8 seropositivity was inversely associated with education (P = .01, for trend) and was elevated in the West Nile region, compared with the Central region (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.02-2.18]) but not with other regions.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that HHV8 seropositivity in Uganda may be influenced by cofactors correlated with small-area geography, age, sex, and education.

In the present study we demonstrated that HIV-exposed seronegative commercial sex workers produce lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines at baseline than HIV-negative control subjects. We also showed that CD4(+) T cells of HIV-exposed seronegative commercial sex workers have a characteristically lower level of gene expression that can be seen in differentially expressed genes and systems crucial for HIV replication, such as the T cell receptor pathway and previously identified HIV dependency factors. This apparent lowered activation results in a phenomenon we term "immune quiescence," which may contribute to host resistance to HIV.

   annosum sensu lato
AB We investigated two hypotheses for the origin of the root rot fungus Heterobasidion annosum species complex: (i) that geology has been an important factor for the speciation (ii) that co-evolutionary processes with the hosts drove the divergence of the pathogen species. The H. annosum species complex consists of five species: three occur in Europe, H. annosum s.s., Heterobasidion parviporum and Heterobasidion abietinum, and two in North America, Heterobasidion irregulare and Heterobasidion occidentale; all with different but partially overlapping host preferences. The evolution of the H. annosum species complex was studied using six partially sequenced genes, between 10 and 30 individuals of each species were analysed. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed for each gene, and a Bayesian tree was built for the combined data set. In addition, haplotype networks were constructed to illustrate the species relationships. For three of the genes, H. parviporum and H. abietinum share haplotypes supporting recent divergence and/or possible gene flow. We propose that the H. annosum species complex originated in Laurasia and that the H. annosum s.s./H. irregulare and H. parviporum/H. abietinum/H. occidentale ancestral species emerged between 45 and 60 Ma in the Palaearctic, well after the radiation of the host genera. Our data imply that H. irregulare and H. occidentale were colonizing North America via different routes. In conclusion, plate tectonics are likely to have been the main factor influencing Heterobasidion speciation and biogeography.

TI Arbovirus Detection in Insect Vectors by Rapid, High-Throughput
   Pyrosequencing
AB Background: Despite the global threat caused by arthropod-borne viruses, there is not an efficient method for screening vector populations to detect novel viral sequences. Current viral detection and surveillance methods based on culture can be costly and time consuming and are predicated on prior knowledge of the etiologic agent, as they rely on specific oligonucleotide primers or antibodies. Therefore, these techniques may be unsuitable for situations when the causative agent of an outbreak is unknown.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we explored the use of high-throughput pyrosequencing for surveillance of arthropod-borne RNA viruses. Dengue virus, a member of the positive strand RNA Flavivirus family that is transmitted by several members of the Aedes genus of mosquitoes, was used as a model. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes experimentally infected with dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) were pooled with noninfected mosquitoes to simulate samples derived from ongoing arbovirus surveillance programs. Using random-primed methods, total RNA was reverse-transcribed and resulting cDNA subjected to 454 pyrosequencing.
   Conclusions/Significance: In two types of samples, one with 5 adult mosquitoes infected with DENV-1- and the other with 1 DENV-1 infected mosquito and 4 noninfected mosquitoes, we identified DENV-1 DNA sequences. DENV-1 sequences were not detected in an uninfected control pool of 5 adult mosquitoes. We calculated the proportion of the Ae. aegypti metagenome contributed by each infecting Dengue virus genome (p(IP)), which ranged from 2.75x10(-8) to 1.08x10(-7). DENV-1 RNA was sufficiently concentrated in the mosquito that its detection was feasible using current high-throughput sequencing instrumentation. We also identified some of the components of the mosquito microflora on the basis of the sequence of expressed RNA. This included members of the bacterial genera Pirellula and Asaia, various fungi, and a potentially uncharacterized mycovirus.

The aim of this study was to describe the population structure of Ethiopian strains of Leishmania donovani derived from different areas endemic for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a prerequisite for the design of effective control strategies against the disease.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Sixty-three strains of L. donovani newly isolated from VL cases in the two main Ethiopian foci, in the north Ethiopia (NE) and south Ethiopia (SE) of the country were investigated by using 14 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. The microsatellite profiles of 60 previously analysed L. donovani strains from Sudan, Kenya and India were included for comparison. Multilocus microsatellite typing placed strains from SE and Kenya (n = 30) in one population and strains from NE and Sudan (n = 65) in another. These two East African populations corresponded to the areas of distribution of two different sand fly vectors. In NE and Sudan Phlebotomus orientalis has been implicated to transmit the parasites and in SE and Kenya P. martini. The genetic differences between parasites from NE and SE are also congruent with some phenotypic differences. Each of these populations was further divided into two subpopulations. Interestingly, in one of the subpopulations of the population NE we observed predominance of strains isolated from HIV-VL co-infected patients and of strains with putative hybrid genotypes. Furthermore, high inbreeding irreconcilable from strict clonal reproduction was found for strains from SE and Kenya indicating a mixed-mating system.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study identified a hierarchical population structure of L. donovani in East Africa. The existence of two main, genetically and geographically separated, populations could reflect different parasite-vector associations, different ecologies and varying host backgrounds and should be further investigated.

TI Viral and Epidemiological Determinants of the Invasion Dynamics of Novel
   Dengue Genotypes
AB Background: Dengue has become a major concern for international public health. Frequent epidemic outbreaks are believed to be driven by a complex interplay of immunological interactions between its four co-circulating serotypes and large fluctuations in mosquito densities. Viral lineage replacement events, caused for example by different levels of cross-protection or differences in viral fitness, have also been linked to a temporary change in dengue epidemiology. A major replacement event was recently described for South-East Asia where the Asian-1 genotype of dengue serotype 2 replaced the resident Asian/American type. Although this was proposed to be due to increased viral fitness in terms of enhanced human-to-mosquito transmission, no major change in dengue epidemiology could be observed.
   Methods/Results: Here we investigate the invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype within a model system and determine the factors influencing the success and rate of fixation as well as their epidemiological consequences. We find that while viral fitness overall correlates with invasion success and competitive exclusion of the resident genotype, the epidemiological landscape plays a more significant role for successful emergence. Novel genotypes can thus face high risks of stochastic extinction despite their fitness advantage if they get introduced during episodes of high dengue prevalence, especially with respect to that particular serotype.
   Conclusion: The rarity of markers for positive selection has often been explained by strong purifying selection whereby the constraints imposed by dengue's two-host cycle are expected to result in a high rate of deleterious mutations. Our results demonstrate that even highly beneficial mutants are under severe threat of extinction, which would suggest that apart from purifying selection, stochastic effects and genetic drift beyond seasonal bottlenecks are equally important in shaping dengue's viral ecology and evolution.

TI Chagas Cardiomyopathy Manifestations and Trypanosoma cruzi Genotypes
   Circulating in Chronic Chagasic Patients
AB Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi is a complex disease that is endemic and an important problem in public health in Latin America. The T. cruzi parasite is classified into six discrete taxonomic units (DTUs) based on the recently proposed nomenclature (TcI, TcII, TcIII, TcIV, TcV and TcVI). The discovery of genetic variability within TcI showed the presence of five genotypes (Ia, Ib, Ic, Id and Ie) related to the transmission cycle of Chagas disease. In Colombia, TcI is more prevalent but TcII has also been reported, as has mixed infection by both TcI and TcII in the same Chagasic patient. The objectives of this study were to determine the T. cruzi DTUs that are circulating in Colombian chronic Chagasic patients and to obtain more information about the molecular epidemiology of Chagas disease in Colombia. We also assessed the presence of electrocardiographic, radiologic and echocardiographic abnormalities with the purpose of correlating T. cruzi genetic variability and cardiac disease. Molecular characterization was performed in Colombian adult chronic Chagasic patients based on the intergenic region of the mini-exon gene, the 24S alpha and 18S regions of rDNA and the variable region of satellite DNA, whereby the presence of T. cruzi I, II, III and IV was detected. In our population, mixed infections also occurred, with TcI-TcII, TcI-TcIII and TcI-TcIV, as well as the existence of the TcI genotypes showing the presence of genotypes Ia and Id. Patients infected with TcI demonstrated a higher prevalence of cardiac alterations than those infected with TcII. These results corroborate the predominance of TcI in Colombia and show the first report of TcIII and TcIV in Colombian Chagasic patients. Findings also indicate that Chagas cardiomyopathy manifestations are more correlated with TcI than with TcII in Colombia.

TI Dengue Incidence in Urban and Rural Cambodia: Results from
   Population-Based Active Fever Surveillance, 2006-2008
AB Background: Dengue vaccines are now in late-stage development, and evaluation and robust estimates of dengue disease burden are needed to facilitate further development and introduction. In Cambodia, the national dengue case-definition only allows reporting of children less than 16 years of age, and little is known about dengue burden in rural areas and among older persons. To estimate the true burden of dengue in the largest province of Cambodia, Kampong Cham, we conducted community-based active dengue fever surveillance among the 0-to-19-year age group in rural villages and urban areas during 2006-2008.
   Methods and Findings: Active surveillance for febrile illness was conducted in 32 villages and 10 urban areas by mothers trained to use digital thermometers combined with weekly home visits to identify persons with fever. An investigation team visited families with febrile persons to obtain informed consent for participation in the follow-up study, which included collection of personal data and blood specimens. Dengue-related febrile illness was defined using molecular and serological testing of paired acute and convalescent blood samples. Over the three years of surveillance, 6,121 fever episodes were identified with 736 laboratory-confirmed dengue virus (DENV) infections for incidences of 13.4-57.8/1,000 person-seasons. Average incidence was highest among children less than 7 years of age (41.1/1,000 person-seasons) and lowest among the 16-to-19-year age group (11.3/1,000 person-seasons). The distribution of dengue was highly focal, with incidence rates in villages and urban areas ranging from 1.5-211.5/1,000 person-seasons (median 36.5). During a DENV-3 outbreak in 2007, rural areas were affected more than urban areas (incidence 71 vs. 17/1,000 person-seasons, p<0.001).
   Conclusion: The large-scale active surveillance study for dengue fever in Cambodia found a higher disease incidence than reported to the national surveillance system, particularly in preschool children and that disease incidence was high in both rural and urban areas. It also confirmed the previously observed focal nature of dengue virus transmission.

TI Wide Proteolytic Activity Survey Reinforces Heterogeneity Among
   Trypanosoma cruzi TCI and TCII Wild Populations
AB Chagas disease, caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is characterized by considerable variation in both incidence and infection severity. This variation has been attributed to a set of complex features including the host genetic background, environmental and social factors, and the genetic heterogeneity of parasite populations. Using biochemical and molecular markers these populations can be divided into two major groups (TCI and TCII). In a previous work, our group identified cysteine and metalloprotease activities as good markers for differentiating TCI from TCII wild isolates, with a higher level of heterogeneity observed among TCII isolates. In this investigation, we applied the protease activity assay to a sample of 49 sylvatic T. cruzi isolates that had been previously assessed in terms of their Swiss mice infection patterns. Protease activity profiles were determined at pH 5.5 and 10.0 and was compared with the original host species, phylogenetic lineage, and mice infection characteristics. Substantial variability, with molecular weights ranging from 35 to 220 kDa for active proteases at pH 5.5, and of 30 to 90 kDa for active proteases at pH 10.0, was observed in gelatin substrate gels, with no phenetic separation between TCI and TCII groups or original hosts. The combinatorial expression of proteases recorded among individual isolates may account for the diverse behavior observed for parasite populations in nature.

TI Rats as Indicators of the Presence and Dispersal of Pathogens in Cyprus:
   Ectoparasites, Parasitic Helminths, Enteric Bacteria, and
   Encephalomyocarditis Virus
AB Rodents play an active role in the transmission of a number of zoonoses by harboring and disseminating the pathogens involved, either through their biological materials or via their ectoparasites. Hence, the spatial and seasonal distribution of potential agents of zoonoses may be studied by examining their distribution in the rodent vectors and their ectoparasites. A surveillance was conducted in wild rodents in 51 different areas of Cyprus, an island ecosystem, to monitor the reemergence of Echinococcus granulosus and Encephalomyocarditis virus (pathogens that have been eradicated from Cyprus), to study the presence and dispersal of Salmonella spp. (a bacterium found in patients and poultry in the island), as well as to investigate the presence of helminth parasites and rodent ectoparasites. Biological material collected from 625 rodents, examined macroscopically, microscopically, and after culture, showed that the most widespread pathogens encountered in wild rats (Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus) were helminth parasites, found in 92 animals (three helminth species found for the first time in Cyprus: Cysticercus fasciolaris, Hymenolepis diminuta, and Physalloptera spp.), and Salmonella spp., detected in the intestine of 56 rats (12 different Salmonella spp. and serotypes). None of the rodents were found infected with the cestode Echinococcus or Encephalomyocarditis virus, indicating that the control measures taken by the Veterinary Services on the island prevented its reestablishment despite changing conditions. The rodents were also free of the nematode Trichinella. Over 40% of the rats collected were infested with fleas, mainly Xenopsylla cheopis. The results, analyzed using the Geographical Information System technology, revealed two of the areas studied as high risk for public health.

TI Field-Based Estimates of Avian Mortality from West Nile Virus Infection
AB One of the unique characteristics of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America is the large number of bird species for which the virus can be fatal. WNV mortality has been documented through experimental infections of captive birds and necropsies of free-ranging birds. Investigations of WNV-related mortality in wild birds often focus on species with dramatic population declines (e.g., American Crow, Corvus brachyrhynchos); however, few studies have addressed WNV-related mortality in species not exhibiting marked population declines since the arrival of WNV. We conducted a mark-recapture study of 204 Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) in an area with endemic WNV activity to estimate WNV-related mortality. Previous research has shown that once a bird is infected and recovers from WNV it develops antibodies making it resistant to future infection. Assuming that mortality risks from non-WNV causes were the same for individuals with (had been exposed to WNV) and without antibodies (had not been exposed to WNV), we compared the survival rates of birds with and without WNV antibodies to estimate the impact of WNV on wild birds. An information theoretic approach was used, and the apparent survival was found to be 34.6% lower for individuals without antibodies during the period when WNV was most active (July-September). However, the apparent survival rate was 9.0% higher for individuals without antibodies over the rest of the year. These differences in apparent survival suggest that WNV increases mortality during the WNV season and that chronic effects of WNV infection may also be contributing to mortality. Although WNV appears to have increased mortality rates within the population, population trend data do not indicate declines, suggesting that some cardinal populations can compensate for WNV-related mortality.

TI No Evidence for Resistance to Fenbendazole in Trichostrongylus tenuis, a
   Nematode Parasite of the Red Grouse
AB The parasitic nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis has a detrimental effect on red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) at the individual and population levels. Treatment using grit coated with the anthelmintic fenbendazole hydrochloride reduces parasite infection and increases grouse density. However, a frequent and low dose of anthelmintic increases selection pressure for parasite resistance, a serious practical and economic problem. We used an egg hatch assay to test resistance of T. tenuis from 12 moors in northern England, which differed in grit treatment intensity. The anthelmintic concentration that prevented 50% and 95% of T. tenuis eggs from hatching (ED(50) and ED(95), respectively) did not differ among moors and were not related to treatment. We suggest annual monitoring and responsible anthelmintic use to prevent resistance so that medicated grit continues to enhance red grouse management.

TI An experimental study of the population and evolutionary dynamics of
   Vibrio cholerae O1 and the bacteriophage JSF4
AB Studies of Vibrio cholerae in the environment and infected patients suggest that the waning of cholera outbreaks is associated with rise in the density of lytic bacteriophage. In accordance with mathematical models, there are seemingly realistic conditions where phage predation could be responsible for declines in the incidence of cholera. Here, we present the results of experiments with the El Tor strain of V. cholerae (N16961) and a naturally occurring lytic phage (JSF4), exploring the validity of the main premise of this model: that phage predation limits the density of V. cholerae populations. At one level, the results of our experiments are inconsistent with this hypothesis. JSF4-resistant V. cholerae evolve within a short time following their confrontation with these viruses and their populations become limited by resources rather than phage predation. At a larger scale, however, the results of our experiments are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that bacteriophage modulate outbreaks of cholera. We postulate that the resistant bacteria that evolved play an insignificant role in the ecology or pathogenicity of V. cholerae. Relative to the phage-sensitive cells from whence they are derived, the evolved JSF4-resistant V. cholerae have fitness costs and other characters that are likely to impair their ability to compete with the sensitive cells in their natural habitat and may be avirulent in human hosts. The results of this in vitro study make predictions that can be tested in natural populations of V. cholerae and cholera-infected patients.

TI Genetic variation in the cellular response of Daphnia magna (Crustacea:
   Cladocera) to its bacterial parasite
AB Linking measures of immune function with infection, and ultimately, host and parasite fitness is a major goal in the field of ecological immunology. In this study, we tested for the presence and timing of a cellular immune response in the crustacean Daphnia magna following exposure to its sterilizing endoparasite Pasteuria ramosa. We found that D. magna possesses two cell types circulating in the haemolymph: a spherical one, which we call a granulocyte and an irregular-shaped amoeboid cell first described by Metchnikoff over 125 years ago. Daphnia magna mounts a strong cellular response (of the amoeboid cells) just a few hours after parasite exposure. We further tested for, and found, considerable genetic variation for the magnitude of this cellular response. These data fostered a heuristic model of resistance in this naturally coevolving host-parasite interaction. Specifically, the strongest cellular responses were found in the most susceptible hosts, indicating resistance is not always borne from a response that destroys invading parasites, but rather stems from mechanisms that prevent their initial entry. Thus, D. magna may have a two-stage defence-a genetically determined barrier to parasite establishment and a cellular response once establishment has begun.

   Viruses in Trinidad: Enzootic Transmission and a New Potential Vector of
   Mucambo Virus
AB Mosquito surveillance was carried out in three forested regions of Trinidad during July 2007 March 2009. A total of 185,397 mosquitoes representing at least 46 species was collected, divided into pools of 1-50 mosquitoes according to species and sex, and screened for arboviruses using cytopathic effect assays on Vero cell monolayers. Eighty-five viruses were isolated, including members of the genera Alphavirus (Mucambo virus; MUCV) and Orthobunyavirus (Caraparu, Oriboca, Bimiti, and Wyeomyia viruses). Species of the Culex. subgenus Melanoconion accounted for 56% of the total number of mosquitoes collected and 97% of the viruses isolated; Cx. (Mel.) portesi accounted for 92% of virus isolations. Our results also implicate for the first time Aedes (Ochlerotatus) hortator as a potential vector of MUCV. Phylogenetic analyses of 43 MUCV strains suggest population subdivision within Trinidad, consistent with the hypothesis of enzootic maintenance in localized rodent populations.

TI When Does Coevolution Promote Diversification?
AB Coevolutionary interactions between species are thought to be an important cause of evolutionary diversification. Despite this general belief, little theoretical basis exists for distinguishing between the types of interactions that promote diversification and those types that have no effect or that even restrict it. Using analytical models and simulations of phenotypic evolution across a metapopulation, we show that coevolutionary interactions promote diversification when they impose a cost of phenotype matching, as is the case for competition or host-parasite antagonism. In contrast, classical coevolutionary arms races have no tendency to promote or inhibit diversification, and mutualistic interactions actually restrict diversification. Together with the results of recent phylogenetic and ecological studies, these results suggest that the causes of diversification in many coevolutionary systems may require reassessment.

TI Flying Over an Infected Landscape: Distribution of Highly Pathogenic
   Avian Influenza H5N1 Risk in South Asia and Satellite Tracking of Wild
   Waterfowl
AB Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus persists in Asia, posing a threat to poultry, wild birds, and humans. Previous work in Southeast Asia demonstrated that HPAI H5N1 risk is related to domestic ducks and people. Other studies discussed the role of migratory birds in the long distance spread of HPAI H5N1. However, the interplay between local persistence and long-distance dispersal has never been studied. We expand previous geospatial risk analysis to include South and Southeast Asia, and integrate the analysis with migration data of satellite-tracked wild waterfowl along the Central Asia flyway. We find that the population of domestic duck is the main factor delineating areas at risk of HPAI H5N1 spread in domestic poultry in South Asia, and that other risk factors, such as human population and chicken density, are associated with HPAI H5N1 risk within those areas. We also find that satellite tracked birds (Ruddy Shelduck and two Bar-headed Geese) reveal a direct spatio-temporal link between the HPAI H5N1 hot-spots identified in India and Bangladesh through our risk model, and the wild bird outbreaks in May-June-July 2009 in China (Qinghai Lake), Mongolia, and Russia. This suggests that the continental-scale dynamics of HPAI H5N1 are structured as a number of persistence areas delineated by domestic ducks, connected by rare transmission through migratory waterfowl.

TI Use of Infrared Camera to Understand Bats' Access to Date Palm Sap:
   Implications for Preventing Nipah Virus Transmission
AB Pteropus bats are commonly infected with Nipah virus, but show no signs of illness. Human Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh coincide with the date palm sap harvesting season. In epidemiologic studies, drinking raw date palm sap is a risk factor for human Nipah infection. We conducted a study to evaluate bats' access to date palm sap. We mounted infrared cameras that silently captured images upon detection of motion on date palm trees from 5:00 pm to 6:00 am. Additionally, we placed two locally used preventative techniques, bamboo skirts and lime (CaCO3) smeared on date palm trees to assess their effectiveness in preventing bats access to sap. Out of 20 camera-nights of observations, 14 identified 132 visits of bats around the tree, 91 to the shaved surface of the tree where the sap flow originates, 4 at the stream of sap moving toward the collection pot, and no bats at the tap or on the collection pots; the remaining 6 camera-nights recorded no visits. Of the preventative techniques, the bamboo skirt placed for four camera-nights prevented bats access to sap. This study confirmed that bats commonly visited date palm trees and physically contacted the sap collected for human consumption. This is further evidence that date palm sap is an important link between Nipah virus in bats and Nipah virus in humans. Efforts that prevent bat access to the shaved surface and the sap stream of the tree could reduce Nipah spillovers to the human population.

TI Sexually transmitted bacteria affect female cloacal assemblages in a
   wild bird
AB Sexual transmission is an important mode of disease propagation, yet its mechanisms remain largely unknown in wild populations. Birds comprise an important model for studying sexually transmitted microbes because their cloaca provides a potential for both gastrointestinal pathogens and endosymbionts to become incorporated into ejaculates. We experimentally demonstrate in a wild population of kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) that bacteria are transmitted during copulation and affect the composition and diversity of female bacterial communities. We used an anti-insemination device attached to males in combination with a molecular technique (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) that describes bacterial communities. After inseminations were experimentally blocked, the cloacal communities of mates became increasingly dissimilar. Moreover, female cloacal diversity decreased and the extinction of mate-shared bacteria increased, indicating that female cloacal assemblages revert to their pre-copulatory state and that the cloaca comprises a resilient microbial ecosystem.

TI Analysis of multi-strain Bartonella pathogens in natural host population
   - Do they behave as species or minor genetic variants?
AB Modern advances in genetic analysis have made it feasible to ascertain the variant type of a pathogen infecting a host. Classification of pathogen variants is commonly performed by clustering analysis of the observed genetic divergence among the variants. A natural question arises whether the genetically distinct variants are epidemiologically distinct. A broader question is whether the different variants constitute separate microbial species or represent minor variations of the same species. These important issues were addressed in the context of analyzing dynamics of genetically distinct variants of Bartonella bacteria in cotton rat hosts. Frequencies of acquiring a new variant were measured in relation to the genetic differences between variants successively infecting an individual rodent host. Two statistical techniques were introduced for performing such analysis, and the methodologies were illustrated with a set of data collected from a particular multi-strain Bartonella system. We carried out a frequency analysis of co-infection patterns, and a Markov chain analysis of panels of successive mixed infection time series for testing some particular gene-based grouping of the Bartonella variants with a panel of observed disease data from a rodent population. Our analysis suggests that the three genogroups A, B and C of Bartonella function as independent species but the variants within each genogroup enjoy some cross-immunity against each other. The newly developed methodologies are broadly applicable for analyzing other multi-strain pathogen data which are increasingly collected for diverse infectious diseases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

TI Insect herbivore mortality is increased by competition with a
   hemiparasitic plant
AB P>1. Individual plants are often simultaneously consumed by many different organisms and mediate important indirect interactions between their consumers, even when their consumers are phylogenetically distant and feed on different parts of the plant.
   2. We examined the effects on two xylem feeders of sharing a plant host in greenhouse pot trials and outdoor mesocosms. The spittle bug Neophilaenus lineatus, which feeds on grass shoots, and a hemiparasitic angiosperm, Rhinanthus minor, which attaches to the roots, were added separately or together on grass host plants growing in pots or in model grassland swards.
   3. We found strong asymmetric competition between the hemiparasite and the insect. In greenhouse experiments, sharing a grass host with R. minor significantly increased mortality of N. lineatus, but R. minor performance was unaffected.
   4. Mortality of N. lineatus was also increased on swards containing R. minor in model communities grown in the field. R. minor was more sensitive to sharing a host with N. lineatus in these communities, and experienced a modest (non-significant) reduction in flower production.
   5. The hemiparasite was the stronger competitor for xylem resources, possibly because of its ability to extract resources from the plant roots, and because of its significant ability to appropriate the xylem stream via its strong transpirational pull.
   6. We believe these are the first experiments to demonstrate competition between insect herbivores and hemiparasitic plants mediated via a shared host plant. The consequences for the invertebrate population were potentially highly significant and we propose that future research should further explore the role of this asymmetric relationship in structuring invertebrate communities.

TI Antibody injection in the egg yolk: maternal antibodies affect humoral
   immune response of the offspring
AB P>1. In vertebrate species, maternal antibodies specific for the pathogens to which mothers have been exposed can be transmitted to offspring before birth. This is assumed to be adaptive as these antibodies can be essential in protecting offspring early in life before their own immune system is fully developed. However, fitness consequences in natural conditions and the long-term effects of these mechanisms have yet to be fully examined.
   2. Exploring the ecological and evolutionary implications of such maternal effects requires experimental manipulations to avoid potential confounding maternal effects. In birds, maternal antibodies are transmitted via the egg yolk - a self contained embryonic environment in which antibodies can be manipulated independently outside the maternal environment.
   3. Here we use a novel technique to extract and experimentally manipulate maternal antibodies in the egg. Using the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), we demonstrate a blocking effect of antigen specific maternal antibodies received via egg injection, on the offspring's antibody response to an immune challenge with this antigen. Our results also suggest lower antibody production after a second immune challenge if maternal antibodies were present during first infection.
   4. Maternal antibodies thus have the potential to affect the development of offspring immunity. Our innovative technique will enable further work to manipulate the transfer of maternal antibodies per se whilst controlling for confounding effects linked to maternal vaccination. Because it also enables to manipulate the amount of antibodies transferred, it will facilitate further study of their adaptive value and ecological consequences in natural host-parasite systems.

TI Coho salmon productivity in relation to salmon lice from infected prey
   and salmon farms
AB 1. Pathogen transmission from open net-pen aquaculture facilities can depress sympatric wild fish populations. However, little is known about the effects of pathogen transmission from farmed fish on species interactions or other ecosystem components. Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch smolts are susceptible hosts to the parasitic salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis as well as a primary predator of juvenile pink Oncorhynchus gorbuscha salmon, a major host species for lice.
   2. We used a hierarchical model of stock-recruit dynamics to compare coho salmon population dynamics across a region that varies in salmon louse infestation of juvenile coho and their pink salmon prey.
   3. During a period of recurring salmon louse infestations in a region of open net-pen salmon farms, coho salmon productivity (recruits per spawner at low spawner abundance) was depressed approximately sevenfold relative to unexposed populations. Alternate hypotheses for the observed difference in productivity, such as declines in coho prey, perturbations to freshwater habitat or stochasticity, are unlikely to explain this pattern.
   4. Lice parasitizing juvenile coho salmon were likely to be trophically transmitted during predation on parasitized juvenile pink salmon as well as directly transmitted from salmon farms.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The finding that species interactions may cause the effects of pathogen transmission from farmed to wild fish to propagate up a marine food web has important conservation implications: (i) the management of salmon aquaculture should consider and account for species interactions and the potential for these interactions to intensify pathogen transmission from farmed to wild fish, (ii) the ecosystem impact of louse transmission from farmed to wild salmon has likely to have been previously underestimated and (iii) comprehensive monitoring of wild salmon and their population dynamics in areas of intensive salmon aquaculture should be a priority to determine if open net-pen salmon aquaculture is ecologically sustainable.

TI Cytoplasmic feminizing elements in a two-population model: infection
   dynamics, gene flow modification, and the spread of autosomal
   suppressors
AB We investigate the dynamics of a cytoplasmic parasitic element with feminizing effect in a two-population model. We assume that the host species has a ZZ/ZW sex determination system. Our analysis reveals that the feminizer and the W chromosome can stably coexist by dominating different populations if the transmission rate differs significantly between the populations and migration is sufficiently weak. In the equilibrium of coexistence, genetic influx at any host autosomal locus is strongly enhanced in the population where infection is prevalent but not modified in the other population. We further explore conditions for the spread of autosomal suppressor genes that reduce transmission of feminizing elements to the cost of host viability, and compute their equilibrium frequencies. Our results confirm the hypothesis that selfish genetic elements convert infected host populations into genetic sinks, thereby restricting the spread of transmission suppressors.

TI Within-host viral evolution in a heterogeneous environment: insights
   into the HIV co-receptor switch
AB A virus infecting a host faces a heterogeneous and a spatially structured environment. Using a mathematical model that incorporates two types of target cells and spatial structuring, we investigate conditions for viral within-host diversification. We show that branching occurs for a wide range of parameters but that it always requires some spatial structure. Applying our model to the case of HIV, we show that it captures three main properties of the 'co-receptor switch' observed in many HIV infections: the initial dominance of virus strains that infect CCR5+ cells, the late switch in some (but, importantly, not all) HIV infections and the associated drop in the number of uninfected T-cells. This suggests that the co-receptor switch could result from gradual adaptation of the virus population to target cell heterogeneity. More generally, we argue that evolutionary ecology can help us better understand the course of some infections.

   (avian beta-defensins) reveal functional differences in microbial
   inhibition
AB Allelic variation in immune genes might result from, and contribute to, host-pathogen evolution. Functional allelic variation in the innate immune system has received little attention. Here, we investigate whether naturally occurring allelic variation within the avian innate immune system (beta-defensins) is associated with variation in antimicrobial activity. We tested differences in in vitro antimicrobial properties of the synthesized products of two alleles of avian beta-defensin 7, both of which occur at high frequency in natural populations of the great tit (Parus major). Only one allele strongly inhibited the growth of the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, but both alleles strongly inhibited growth of the gram-negative bacterium Escherechia coli. Our data demonstrate functional allelic variation in natural defensin genes, and we discuss how differences in efficacy against microbial species might contribute to maintaining this variation.

TI Absence of population-level phenotype matching in an obligate
   pollination mutualism
AB Coevolution is thought to promote evolutionary change between demes that ultimately results in speciation. If this is the case, then we should expect to see similar patterns of trait matching and phenotypic divergence between populations and between species in model systems for coevolution. As measures of divergence are frequently only available at one scale (population level or taxon level), this contention is rarely tested directly. Here, we use the case of co-divergence between different varieties of Joshua tree Yucca brevifolia (Agavaceae) and their obligate pollinators, two yucca moths (Tegeticula spp. Prodoxidae), to test for trait matching between taxa and among populations. Using model selection, we show that there is trait matching between mutualists at the taxon level, but once we account for differences between taxa, there is no indication of trait matching in local populations. This result differs from similar studies in other coevolving systems. We hypothesize that this discrepancy arises because coevolution in obligate mutualisms favours divergence less strongly than coevolution in other systems, such as host-parasite interactions.

TI In Vitro Genetic Analysis of an Erythrocyte Determinant of Malaria
   Infection
AB Invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum is an obligatory step in the life cycle of the parasite. A major challenge is the unambiguous identification and characterization of host receptors. Because erythrocytes lack nuclei, direct genetic analyses have been limited. In this work, we combined an in vitro erythrocyte culture system, which supports P. falciparum invasion and growth, with lentiviral transduction to knock down gene expression. We genetically demonstrate, in an isogenic background, that glycophorin A is required for efficient strain-specific parasite invasion. We establish the feasibility of in vitro systematic functional analysis of essential erythrocyte determinants of malaria and erythrocyte biology.

TI Factors affecting transmission of mucosal human papillomavirus
AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection. The effect of HPV on public health is especially related to the burden of anogenital cancers, most notably cervical cancer. Determinants of exposure to HPV are similar to those for most sexually transmitted infections, but determinants of susceptibility and infectivity are much less well established. Gaps exist in understanding of interactions between HPV, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections. The roles of mucosal immunology, human microbiota at mucosal surfaces, host genetic factors and hormonal concentrations on HPV susceptibility and infectivity are poorly understood, as are the level of effectiveness of some primary or secondary preventive measures other than HPV vaccination (such as condoms, male circumcision, and combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV). Prospective couples studies, studies focusing on mucosal immunology, and in-vitro raft culture studies mimicking HPV infection might increase understanding of the dynamics of HPV transmission.

TI Seasonal changes in the feeding pattern of Culex pipiens pallens govern
   the transmission dynamics of multiple lineages of avian malaria
   parasites in Japanese wild bird community
AB Heterogeneity in the transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens is determined largely by distribution patterns of mosquito bites among wild animal populations. Although mosquitoes are crucial for transmission of avian malaria parasites, little is known about the ecology of natural vectors. We examined bloodmeal and parasite incidence in Culex pipiens pallens by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based procedure to determine how the feeding pattern of mosquitoes govern transmission dynamics of avian malaria parasites in Japanese wild birds. We collected 881 unfed and 486 blood-fed Cx. pipiens pallens resting on vegetation in a park in Tokyo. The mosquitoes were separated into abdomen and thorax prior to PCR screening. Abdomens of unfed mosquitoes were combined into 95 pools. From these, we amplified Plasmodium DNA in 32 (33.7%) pools. Among blood-fed mosquitoes, 371 individuals were screened for blood-sources and Plasmodium parasites. Plasmodium DNA was amplified from mosquitoes fed on 6 of 13 avian species identified as blood-sources. Ten Plasmodium lineages were identified on the basis of 478 bp of the cytochrome b gene, with 0.2-10% sequence divergence. The three commonest Plasmodium lineages (CXPIP09, SGS1 and PADOM02) were detected in both the abdomens and thoraxes of mosquitoes, strongly suggesting transmission of these lineages. Jungle crow (Corvus macrorhynchos) served as a natural host for the three commonest Plasmodium lineages and made up 63.8% of blood-sources. As a significant increase in feeding of vector mosquitoes on jungle crows coincided with their breeding season, jungle crows were considered to be the primary reservoir of Plasmodium transmission in this study.

TI The Evolutionary Analysis of Emerging Low Frequency HIV-1 CXCR4 Using
   Variants through Time-An Ultra-Deep Approach
AB Large-scale parallel pyrosequencing produces unprecedented quantities of sequence data. However, when generated from viral populations current mapping software is inadequate for dealing with the high levels of variation present, resulting in the potential for biased data loss. In order to apply the 454 Life Sciences' pyrosequencing system to the study of viral populations, we have developed software for the processing of highly variable sequence data. Here we demonstrate our software by analyzing two temporally sampled HIV-1 intra-patient datasets from a clinical study of maraviroc. This drug binds the CCR5 coreceptor, thus preventing HIV-1 infection of the cell. The objective is to determine viral tropism (CCR5 versus CXCR4 usage) and track the evolution of minority CXCR4-using variants that may limit the response to a maraviroc-containing treatment regimen. Five time points (two prior to treatment) were available from each patient. We first quantify the effects of divergence on initial read k-mer mapping and demonstrate the importance of utilizing population-specific template sequences in relation to the analysis of next-generation sequence data. Then, in conjunction with coreceptor prediction algorithms that infer HIV tropism, our software was used to quantify the viral population structure pre- and post-treatment. In both cases, low frequency CXCR4-using variants (2.5-15%) were detected prior to treatment. Following phylogenetic inference, these variants were observed to exist as distinct lineages that were maintained through time. Our analysis, thus confirms the role of pre-existing CXCR4-using virus in the emergence of maraviroc-insensitive HIV. The software will have utility for the study of intra-host viral diversity and evolution of other fast evolving viruses, and is available from http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/segminator/.

TI Sex, Subdivision, and Domestic Dispersal of Trypanosoma cruzi Lineage I
   in Southern Ecuador
AB Background: Molecular epidemiology at the community level has an important guiding role in zoonotic disease control programmes where genetic markers are suitably variable to unravel the dynamics of local transmission. We evaluated the molecular diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, in southern Ecuador (Loja Province). This kinetoplastid parasite has traditionally been a paradigm for clonal population structure in pathogenic organisms. However, the presence of naturally occurring hybrids, mitochondrial introgression, and evidence of genetic exchange in the laboratory question this dogma.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Eighty-one parasite isolates from domiciliary, peridomiciliary, and sylvatic triatomines and mammals were genotyped across 10 variable microsatellite loci. Two discrete parasite populations were defined: one predominantly composed of isolates from domestic and peridomestic foci, and another predominantly composed of isolates from sylvatic foci. Spatial genetic variation was absent from the former, suggesting rapid parasite dispersal across our study area. Furthermore, linkage equilibrium between loci, Hardy-Weinberg allele frequencies at individual loci, and a lack of repeated genotypes are indicative of frequent genetic exchange among individuals in the domestic/peridomestic population.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data represent novel population-level evidence of an extant capacity for sex among natural cycles of T. cruzi transmission. As such they have dramatic implications for our understanding of the fundamental genetics of this parasite. Our data also elucidate local disease transmission, whereby passive anthropogenic domestic mammal and triatomine dispersal across our study area is likely to account for the rapid domestic/peridomestic spread of the parasite. Finally we discuss how this, and the observed subdivision between sympatric sylvatic and domestic/peridomestic foci, can inform efforts at Chagas disease control in Ecuador.

TI Quantifying the Spatial Dimension of Dengue Virus Epidemic Spread within
   a Tropical Urban Environment
AB Background: Dengue infection spread in naive populations occurs in an explosive and widespread fashion primarily due to the absence of population herd immunity, the population dynamics and dispersal of Ae. aegypti, and the movement of individuals within the urban space. Knowledge on the relative contribution of such factors to the spatial dimension of dengue virus spread has been limited. In the present study we analyzed the spatio-temporal pattern of a large dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) outbreak that affected the Australian city of Cairns (north Queensland) in 2003, quantified the relationship between dengue transmission and distance to the epidemic's index case (IC), evaluated the effects of indoor residual spraying (IRS) on the odds of dengue infection, and generated recommendations for city-wide dengue surveillance and control.
   Methods and Findings: We retrospectively analyzed data from 383 DENV-2 confirmed cases and 1,163 IRS applications performed during the 25-week epidemic period. Spatial (local k-function, angular wavelets) and space-time (Knox test) analyses quantified the intensity and directionality of clustering of dengue cases, whereas a semi-parametric Bayesian space-time regression assessed the impact of IRS and spatial autocorrelation in the odds of weekly dengue infection. About 63% of the cases clustered up to 800 m around the IC's house. Most cases were distributed in the NW-SE axis as a consequence of the spatial arrangement of blocks within the city and, possibly, the prevailing winds. Space-time analysis showed that DENV-2 infection spread rapidly, generating 18 clusters (comprising 65% of all cases), and that these clusters varied in extent as a function of their distance to the IC's residence. IRS applications had a significant protective effect in the further occurrence of dengue cases, but only when they reached coverage of 60% or more of the neighboring premises of a house.
   Conclusion: By applying sound statistical analysis to a very detailed dataset from one of the largest outbreaks that affected the city of Cairns in recent times, we not only described the spread of dengue virus with high detail but also quantified the spatio-temporal dimension of dengue virus transmission within this complex urban environment. In areas susceptible to non-periodic dengue epidemics, effective disease prevention and control would depend on the prompt response to introduced cases. We foresee that some of the results and recommendations derived from our study may also be applicable to other areas currently affected or potentially subject to dengue epidemics.

TI Bacterial Pathogens in Ixodid Ticks from a Piedmont County in North
   Carolina: Prevalence of Rickettsial Organisms
AB In North Carolina, reported human cases of tick-borne illness, specifically Rocky Mountain spotted fever, have escalated over the past decade. To determine the relative abundance of vectors and to estimate the risk of acquiring a tick-borne illness in peri-residential landscapes, ticks were collected in Chatham County, a typical Piedmont county and, samples of the ticks were tested for infection with selected bacterial pathogens using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Ticks (n = 3746) were collected by flagging vegetation at 26 sites from April to July 2006. The predominant questing tick was Amblyomma americanum (98.5%) with significantly fewer Dermacentor variabilis (1.0%) and Ixodes scapularis (0.5%) collected. Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae were detected in 68.2% of 1590 A. americanum with 56.4% of the molecular isolates identified as Rickettsia amblyommii, an informally named member of the SFG rickettsiae. Comparatively, smaller numbers of A. americanum contained Ehrlichia chaffeensis (1.8%) and Borrelia lonestari (0.4%). Of 15 I. scapularis nymphs tested, 6 (40%) were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Seven (19.4%) of 36 adult D. variabilis tested positive for Rickettsia montanensis, 4 (11.1%) were positive for R. amblyommii, and 5 (13.9%) were infected with unidentified species of SFG rickettsiae. The tick population in Chatham County contains a diverse array of microbes, some of which are known or potential pathogens. Highest attack rates would be expected from A. americanum ticks, and highest potential risk of infection with a tick-transmitted agent would be to rickettsial organisms, particularly R. amblyommii. Accordingly, longitudinal eco-epidemiology investigations are needed to determine the public health importance of A. americanum infected with rickettsial organisms.

TI Vertical Transmission of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus in Culex
   quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Cordoba, Argentina
AB Arbovirus vector transmission is interrupted when vector abundance decreases or disappears in temperate regions during the winter season. Although the primary overwintering mechanism for many arboviruses in nature remains unknown, vertical transmission is one potential mechanism. Vertical transmission functions as an overwintering mechanism for St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) in temperate areas of Argentina, where SLEV is endemic. The aim of this project was to detect vertical transmission of SLEV in Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Under laboratory conditions, SLEV vertical transmission (3.4 minimum infection rates) was detected in larvae (1: 256) and adults F(1) (1: 406). There were no positive larvae for SLEV among over 2011 analyzed individuals collected in nature. This is the first study to confirm experimental vertical transmission of SLEV in Cx. quinquefasciatus populations from Argentina, though additional overwintering mechanisms (e. g., nontraditional vectors such as ticks and nondiapausing female mosquitoes) should be considered.

   albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) by One-Step SYBR Green-Based Reverse
   Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay During 2004-2007 in
   Southern Taiwan
AB We carried out virological surveillance of dengue virus (DENV) in field-caught Aedes mosquitoes during 2004-2007 to estimate the monthly prevalence of infected females in dengue high-risk areas of Taiwan. A total of 92,892 Aedes aegypti (43,133 females and 49,759 males) and 79,315 Aedes albopictus (57,319 females and 21,996 males) adults were collected, grouped into 25,654 pools, and processed for virus detection using a one-step SYBR Green-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. DENVs were periodically and sympatrically detected in Ae. aegypti females in accordance with major dengue outbreaks and the corresponding dengue serotypes. Only 0.2% of 7628 pools of Ae. aegypti females were positive for DENVs. This resulted in an overall estimated infection rate (maximum likelihood estimation) of 0.970 per 1000 mosquitoes (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53-1.65). The total monthly infection rates ranged from 0.50 to 2.23 per 1000 mosquitoes (95% CI = 0.03-10.71). When sampling areas were scaled down to the city level, monthly infection rates increased to 0.73-12.59 (95% CI = 0.06-59.19). Monthly infection rates over all sampling areas and at the city level increased significantly by month. All positive pools were collected in July (one pool), August (two pools), September (one pool), October (three pools), November (four pools), and December (one pool). All four virus serotypes were detected in mosquitoes, which were consistent with dengue serotypes infecting humans in 2004 (DENV-4), 2005 and 2006 (DENV-2 and DENV-3), and 2007 (DENV-1). Our results provide supporting evidence that, in general, DENV infection rates were low in local Aedes mosquito population during 2004-2007 and that transovarial transmission may not be occurring or is occurring at much lower rates than evidenced in some endemic countries.

TI Seasonal Dynamics of Ixodes ricinus in a 3-Year Period in Northern
   Spain: First Survey on the Presence of Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus
AB No cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in humans have ever been diagnosed in Spain. However, it is not clear if the necessary conditions for TBE virus (TBEV) persistence and transmission exist there, particularly synchrony in larval and nymphal activity, which has been related to the appearance of TBE in several countries. This synchrony allows ticks to cofeed on the same rodent host, facilitating transmission of TBEV between tick stages. From March 2006 to October 2008, 182 tick samplings were carried out on a monthly basis in six field sites in northern Spain using the blanket dragging technique. A total of 964 tick adults, 10,117 nymphs, and 73,534 larvae were counted. Ixodes ricinus was the predominant tick species. More number of adults, nymphs, and larvae were captured during the first year (2006) compared with the second or third years (p < 0.05). Adults and nymphs were more active between April and June, whereas the peak of larvae appeared between May and September. Good synchrony between larvae and nymphs was observed only in two sampling sites, where mean maximum temperatures were below 10 degrees C from November 2006 to March 2007, but this synchrony was not maintained during the third year. Significant associations were found between abundance of I. ricinus larvae and temperature. Presence of TBEV was investigated by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 1800 nymphs analyzed in pools of 5 and in 630 adults processed individually, and all of them were negative. We therefore concluded that TBEV prevalence is either very low or absent in the investigated regions in northern Spain and current conditions there do not seem to favor TBEV maintenance. However, active and extensive surveillance based on epidemiological data collection, including data on changes in livestock, temporal fluctuations in density of small mammals, as well as tick seasonal population dynamics, is indispensable to predict the appearance of new TBE foci and recommend preventive measures.

TI Spatial Pattern Switching Enables Cyclic Evolution in Spatial Epidemics
AB Infectious diseases often spread as spatial epidemic outbreak waves. A number of model studies have shown that such spatial pattern formation can have important consequences for the evolution of pathogens. Here, we show that such spatial patterns can cause cyclic evolutionary dynamics in selection for the length of the infectious period. The necessary reversal in the direction of selection is enabled by a qualitative change in the spatial pattern from epidemic waves to irregular local outbreaks. The spatial patterns are an emergent property of the epidemic system, and they are robust against changes in specific model assumptions. Our results indicate that emergent spatial patterns can act as a rich source for complexity in pathogen evolution.

TI Type 2 Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus from Patients with Acute Flaccid
   Paralysis in China: Current Immunization Strategy Effectively Prevented
   Its Sustained Transmission
AB In China, 5 patients with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) were identified by an AFP surveillance system from 1996 through 2009. A maximum-likelihood tree shows that all 5 Chinese VDPVs were independent. These 5 VDPVs were 100-216 d old according to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site and 176-292 d old according to the number of substitutions per site. This result indicates limited virus replication since the administration of the initiating oral polio vaccine (OPV) dose, which is consistent with the rapid evolution rate of poliovirus genomes. The above-mentioned VDPVs have important implications in the global polio eradication initiative. Localized, limited, and transient circulation may be typical of OPVs; hence, independent VDPVs could be found because of the large population and excellent surveillance system, which permitted early detection and response, but sustained transmission was limited because of high population immunity.

TI Parasite and host assemblages: embracing the reality will improve our
   knowledge of parasite transmission and virulence
AB Interactions involving several parasite species (multi-parasitized hosts) or several host species (multi-host parasites) are the rule in nature. Only a few studies have investigated these realistic, but complex, situations from an evolutionary perspective. Consequently, their impact on the evolution of parasite virulence and transmission remains poorly understood. The mechanisms by which multiple infections may influence virulence and transmission include the dynamics of intrahost competition, mediation by the host immune system and an increase in parasite genetic recombination. Theoretical investigations have yet to be conducted to determine which of these mechanisms are likely to be key factors in the evolution of virulence and transmission. In contrast, the relationship between multi-host parasites and parasite virulence and transmission has seen some theoretical investigation. The key factors in these models are the trade-off between virulence across different host species, variation in host species quality and patterns of transmission. The empirical studies on multi-host parasites suggest that interspecies transmission plays a central role in the evolution of virulence, but as yet no complete picture of the phenomena involved is available. Ultimately, determining how complex host-parasite interactions impact the evolution of host-parasite relationships will require the development of cross-disciplinary studies linking the ecology of quantitative networks with the evolution of virulence.

TI Hantavirus infections in fluctuating host populations: the role of
   maternal antibodies
AB Infected females may transfer maternal antibodies (MatAbs) to their offspring, which may then be transiently protected against infections the mother has encountered. However, the role of maternal protection in infectious disease dynamics in wildlife has largely been neglected. Here, we investigate the effects of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV)-specific MatAbs on PUUV dynamics, using 7 years' data from a cyclic bank vole population in Finland. For the first time to our knowledge, we partition seropositivity data from a natural population into separate dynamic patterns for MatAbs and infection. The likelihood of young of the year carrying PUUV-specific MatAbs during the breeding season correlated positively with infection prevalence in the overwintered parent population in the preceding spring. The probability of PUUV infection varied between seasons (highest in spring, lowest in late summer) and depended on population structure, but was also, in late autumn, notably, negatively related to summer MatAb prevalence, as well as to infection prevalence earlier in the breeding season. Hence, our results suggest that high infection prevalence in the early breeding season leads to a high proportion of transiently immune young individuals, which causes delays in transmission. This suggests, in turn, that MatAb protection has the potential to affect infection dynamics in natural populations.

TI Bacteria-Phage Coevolution and the Emergence of Generalist Pathogens
AB Understanding the genetic constraints on pathogen evolution will help to predict the emergence of generalist pathogens that can infect a range of different host genotypes. Here we show that generalist viral pathogens are more likely to emerge during coevolution between the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the lytic phage SBW25 Phi 2 than when the same pathogen is challenged to adapt to a nonevolving population of novel hosts. When phages were able to adapt to nonevolving novel hosts, the resulting phenotypes had relatively narrow host ranges compared with coevolved phages. Evolved (rather than coevolved) phages also had lower virulence, although they attained virulence similar to that of coevolved phages after continued adaptation to a nonevolving population of the same host. We explain these results by using sequence data showing that the evolution of broad host range is associated with several different amino acid substitutions and therefore occurs only through repeated rounds of selection for novel infectivity alleles. These findings suggest that generalist bacteriophages are more likely to emerge through long-term coevolution with their hosts than through spontaneous adaptation to a single novel host. These results are likely to be relevant to host-parasite systems where parasite generalism can evolve through the acquisition of multiple mutations or alleles, as appears to be the case for many plant-bacteria and bacteria-virus interactions.

TI Temperature-Dependent Genotype-by-Genotype Interaction between a
   Pathogenic Fungus and Its Hyperparasitic Virus
AB The outcome of host-parasite interactions may depend not only on the genotypes of the species involved but also on environmental factors. We used the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, the causal agent of chestnut blight, and its hyperparasitic virus, Cryphonectria hypovirus-1 (CHV1), to test for genotype-by-genotype-by-environment interactions in a host-parasite system. In C. parasitica, infection with CHV1 induces a hypovirulent phenotype with reduced virulence toward the chestnut tree (Castanea spp.) and thus controls chestnut blight in many European regions. In contrast, uninfected virulent C. parasitica have nearly eradicated the American chestnut in North America. We applied a full factorial design and assessed the fungal growth and sporulation of four C. parasitica strains, uninfected and infected with each of the four known CHV1 subtypes, at 12 degrees, 18 degrees, 24 degrees, and 30 degrees C. We found a significant (P <= .0001) genotype-by-genotype-by-environment interaction, demonstrating the potential for a selection mosaic. As a consequence, different host and parasite genotypes would be selected under different climatic conditions, affecting the coevolutionary dynamics of the host-parasite interaction and the course of chestnut blight epidemics. Genotype-by-genotype-by-environment interactions are essential to take into account when designing biological control strategies.

TI Nematomorph parasites drive energy flow through a riparian ecosystem
AB Parasites are ubiquitous in natural systems and ecosystem-level effects should be proportional to the amount of biomass or energy flow altered by the parasites. Here we quantified the extent to which a manipulative parasite altered the flow of energy through a forest-stream ecosystem. In a Japanese headwater stream, camel crickets and grasshoppers (Orthoptera) were 20 times more likely to enter a stream if infected by a nematomorph parasite (Gordionus spp.), corroborating evidence that nematomorphs manipulate their hosts to seek water where the parasites emerge as free-living adults. Endangered Japanese trout (Salvelinus leucomaenis japonicus) readily ate these infected orthopterans, which due to their abundance, accounted for 60% of the annual energy intake of the trout population. Trout grew fastest in the fall, when nematomorphs were driving energy-rich orthopterans into the stream. When infected orthopterans were available, trout did not eat benthic invertebrates in proportion to their abundance, leading to the potential for cascading, indirect effects through the forest-stream ecosystem. These results provide the first quantitative evidence that a manipulative parasite can dramatically alter the flow of energy through and across ecosystems.

Results are presented along with a comparison with epidemiological surveillance data which subsequently became available. Simulated epidemics were fitted to the estimated number of influenza-like syndromes collected within the Italian sentinel surveillance systems and showed good agreement with the timing of the observed epidemic. On the basis of the model predictions, we estimated the underreporting factor of the influenza surveillance system to be in the range 3.3-3.7 depending on the scenario considered. Model prediction suggested that the epidemic would peak in early November. These predictions have proved to be a valuable support for public health policy-makers in planning interventions for mitigating the spread of the pandemic.

TI Reproductive ratio for the local spread of highly pathogenic avian
   influenza in wild bird populations of Europe, 2005-2008
AB Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has devastating consequences for the poultry industry of affected countries. Control of HPAI has been impaired by the role of wildlife species that act as disease reservoirs and as a potential source of infection for domestic populations. The reproductive ratio (R-0) of HPAI was quantified in nine clusters of outbreaks detected in wild birds in Europe (2005-2008) for which population data were not available. The median value of R-0 was similar (1.1-3.4) for the nine clusters and it was about tenfold smaller than the value estimated for poultry in The Netherlands in 2003. Results presented here will be useful to parameterize models for spread of HPAI in wild birds and to design effective prevention programmes for the European poultry sector. The method is suitable to estimate R-0 in the absence of population data, which is a condition typically observed for many wildlife and certain domestic species and systems.

TI Wildlife diseases: from individuals to ecosystems
AB P>1. We review our ecological understanding of wildlife infectious diseases from the individual host to the ecosystem scale, highlighting where conceptual thinking lacks verification, discussing difficulties and challenges, and offering potential future research directions.
   2. New molecular approaches hold potential to increase our understanding of parasite interactions within hosts. Also, advances in our knowledge of immune systems makes immunological parameters viable measures of parasite exposure, and useful tools for improving our understanding of causal mechanisms.
   3. Studies of transmission dynamics have revealed the importance of heterogeneity in host behaviour and physiology, and of contact processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales. An important future challenge is to determine the key transmission mechanisms maintaining the persistence of different types of diseases in the wild.
   4. Regulation of host populations is too complex to consider parasite effects in isolation from other factors. One solution is to seek a unified understanding of the conditions under which (and the ecological rules determining when) population scale impacts of parasites can occur.
   5. Good evidence now shows that both direct effects of parasites, and trait mediated indirect effects, frequently mediate the success of invasive species and their impacts on recipient communities. A wider exploration of these effects is now needed.
   6. At the ecosystem scale, research is needed to characterize the circumstances and conditions under which both fluxes in parasite biomass, and trait mediated effects, are significant in ecosystem processes, and to demonstrate that parasites do indeed increase 'ecosystem health'.
   7. There is a general need for more empirical testing of predictions and subsequent development of theory in the classic research cycle. Experimental field studies, meta-analyses, the collection and analysis of long-term data sets, and data constrained modelling, will all be key to advancing our understanding.
   8. Finally, we are only now beginning to understand the importance of cross-scale interactions associated with parasitism. Such interactions may offer key insights into bigger picture questions such as when and how different regulatory factors are important, when disease can cause species extinctions, and what characteristics are indicative of functionally resilient ecosystems.

TI Linking disease and community ecology through behavioural indicators:
   immunochallenge of white-footed mice and its ecological impacts
AB P>1. Pathogens and immune challenges can induce changes in host phenotype in ways that indirectly impact important community interactions, including those that affect host-pathogen interactions.
   2. To explore host behavioural response to immune challenge, we exposed wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) to an immunogen from an endemic, zoonotic pathogen, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. White-footed mice are a major reservoir host of Lyme disease (LD) spirochetes in northeastern USA and an abundant member of forest communities. The activity patterns, foraging behaviour, and space use of white-footed mice have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which mice incidentally prey (i.e. gypsy moths and native thrushes), as well as potentially determining host-vector encounter rates and human risk of LD.
   3. Immunochallenge led to specific humoral (antibody) and cellular (i.e. elevated neutrophils and eosinophils) immune responses, supporting use of the immunogen as a surrogate for pathogenic infection.
   4. Immunochallenged mice had reduced wheel-running activity early in the night when measured in the lab. However, mouse activity, as measured by track plates in natural field experiments, did not differ between mice exposed to the immunogen and unexposed mice.
   5. Foraging behaviour of wild mice in the field - assessed with giving-up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen. Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging mice gained information on patch quality while foraging, it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging, suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging mice may be greater as a result of immunochallenge. This increased space use is predicted to increase encounter rates with patchily distributed LD vectors (ticks) and with incidental prey items.
   6. Thus, immunochallenge in white-footed mice, and potentially pathogenic infection, have the potential to indirectly impact community interactions, including those important for pathogen transmission.

TI The genetic structure of Borrelia afzelii varies with geographic but not
   ecological sampling scale
AB The genetic structure of a pathogen is an important determinant of its potential rate of adaptation and can thereby influence the dynamics of host-parasite interactions. We investigated how the genetic structure of Borrelia afzelii varies with geographic and ecological sampling scale. Genetic structure was measured as the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across three loci. To test for the effects of geographic and ecological scale, we calculated LD across or within populations 4-82 km apart and across or within different mammal host species. There was highly significant LD across populations and host species. However, there was also evidence for genome-wide recombination, and the LD largely resulted from epidemic spread of certain haplotypes, rather than lack of recombination. Interestingly, the degree of LD was higher in each population than in the sample as a whole, i.e. LD increased with decreasing geographic scale. In contrast, there was no effect of ecological sampling scale on LD. Strong LD may impede the rate of adaptive evolution. Our results suggest this effect might be particularly strong at a small geographic scale.

TI Parasite-mediated evolution of the functional part of the MHC in
   primates
AB The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a key model of genetic polymorphism, but the mechanisms underlying its extreme variability are debated. Most hypotheses for MHC diversity focus on pathogen-driven selection and predict that MHC polymorphism evolves under the pressure of a diverse parasite fauna. Several studies reported that certain alleles offer protection against certain parasites, yet it remains unclear whether variation in parasite pressure more generally covaries with allelic diversity and rates of molecular evolution of MHC across species. We tested this prediction in a comparative study of 41 primate species. We characterized polymorphism of the exon 2 of DRB region of the MHC class II. Our phylogenetic analyses controlled for the potential effects of neutral mutation rate, population size, geographic origin and body mass and revealed that nematode species richness associates positively with nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rate at the functional part of the molecule. We failed to find evidence for allelic diversity being strongly related to parasite species richness. Continental distribution was a strong predictor of both allelic diversity and substitution rate, with higher values in Malagasy and Neotropical primates. These results indicate that parasite pressure can influence the different estimates of MHC polymorphism, whereas geography plays an independent role in the natural history of MHC.

TI Towards Delineating Functions within the Fasciola Secreted Cathepsin L
   Protease Family by Integrating In Vivo Based Sub-Proteomics and
   Phylogenetics
AB Background: Fasciola hepatica, along with Fasciola gigantica, is the causative agent of fasciolosis, a foodborne zoonotic disease affecting grazing animals and humans worldwide. Pathology is directly related to the release of parasite proteins that facilitate establishment within the host. The dominant components of these excretory-secretory (ES) products are also the most promising vaccine candidates, the cathepsin L (Cat L) protease family.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The sub-proteome of Cat L proteases from adult F. hepatica ES products derived from in vitro culture and in vivo from ovine host bile were compared by 2-DE. The individual Cat L proteases were identified by tandem mass spectrometry with the support of an in-house translated liver fluke EST database. The study reveals plasticity within the CL1 clade of Cat L proteases; highlighted by the identification of a novel isoform and CL1 sub-clade, resulting in a new Cat L phylogenetic analysis including representatives from other adult Cat L phylogenetic clades. Additionally, for the first time, mass spectrometry was shown to be sufficiently sensitive to reveal single amino acid polymorphisms in a resolved 2-DE protein spot derived from pooled population samples.
   Conclusions/Significance: We have investigated the sub-proteome at the population level of a vaccine target family using the Cat L proteases from F. hepatica as a case study. We have confirmed that F. hepatica exhibits more plasticity in the expression of the secreted CL1 clade of Cat L proteases at the protein level than previously realised. We recommend that superfamily based vaccine discovery programmes should screen parasite populations from different host populations and, if required, different host species via sub-proteomic assay in order to confirm the relative expression at the protein level prior to the vaccine development phase.

TI RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3 Synergistically Play an Important Role in
   Restriction of Dengue Virus Infection
AB Dengue virus (DV) infection is one of the most common mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world. The innate immune system is important for the early detection of virus and for mounting a cascade of defense measures which include the production of type 1 interferon (IFN). Hence, a thorough understanding of the innate immune response during DV infection would be essential for our understanding of the DV pathogenesis. A recent application of the microarray to dengue virus type 1 (DV1) infected lung carcinoma cells revealed the increased expression of both extracellular and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors; retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 (MDA-5) and Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3). These intracellular RNA sensors were previously reported to sense DV infection in different cells. In this study, we show that they are collectively involved in initiating an effective IFN production against DV. Cells silenced for these genes were highly susceptible to DV infection. RIG-I and MDA5 knockdown HUH-7 cells and TLR3 knockout macrophages were highly susceptible to DV infection. When cells were silenced for only RIG-I and MDA5 (but not TLR3), substantial production of IFN-beta was observed upon virus infection and vice versa. High susceptibility to virus infection led to ER-stress induced apoptosis in HUH-7 cells. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the intracellular RNA virus sensors (RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3) are activated upon DV infection and are essential for host defense against the virus.

TI From Re-Emergence to Hyperendemicity: The Natural History of the Dengue
   Epidemic in Brazil
AB Background: Dengue virus (DENV) was reintroduced into Brazil in 1986 and by 1995 it had spread throughout the country. In 2007 the number of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases more than doubled and a shift in the age distribution was reported. While previously the majority of DHF cases occurred among adults, in 2007 53% of cases occurred in children under 15 years old. The reasons for this shift have not been determined.
   Methods and Findings: Age stratified cross-sectional seroepidemiologic survey conducted in Recife, Brazil in 2006. Serostatus was determined by ELISA based detection of Dengue IgG. We estimated time-constant and time-varying forces of infection of DENV between 1986 and 2006. We used discrete-time simulation to estimate the accumulation of monotypic and multitypic immunity over time in a population previously completely susceptible to DENV. We projected the age distribution of population immunity to dengue assuming similar hazards of infection in future years. The overall prevalence of DENV IgG was 0.80 (n = 1427). The time-constant force of infection for the period was estimated to be 0.052 (95% CI 0.041, 0.063), corresponding to 5.2% of susceptible individuals becoming infected each year by each serotype. Simulations show that as time since re-emergence of dengue goes by, multitypic immunity accumulates in adults while an increasing proportion of susceptible individuals and those with monotypic immunity are among young age groups. The median age of those monotypically immune can be expected to shift from 24 years, 10 years after introduction, to 13 years, 50 years after introduction. Of those monotypically immune, the proportion under 15 years old shifts from 27% to 58%. These results are consistent with the dengue notification records from the same region since 1995.
   Interpretation: Assuming that persons who have been monotypically exposed are at highest risk for severe dengue, the shift towards younger patient ages observed in Brazil can be partially explained by the accumulation of multitypic immunity against DENV-1, 2, and 3 in older age groups, 22 years after the re-introduction of these viruses. Serotype specific seroepidemiologic studies are necessary to accurately estimate the serotype specific forces of infection.

TI DC-SIGN (CD209) Promoter-336 A/G Polymorphism Is Associated with Dengue
   Hemorrhagic Fever and Correlated to DC-SIGN Expression and Immune
   Augmentation
AB Background: The C-type lectin DC-SIGN (CD209) is known to be the major dengue receptor on human dendritic cells, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of CD209 (-336 A/G; rs4804803) is susceptible to many infectious diseases. We reason that variations in the DC-SIGN gene might have a broad influence on viral replication and host immune responses.
   Methods and Findings: We studied whether the rs4804803 SNP was associated with a susceptibility to dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) through genotyping analysis in a Taiwanese cohort. We generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from individuals with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803 to study the viral replication and immune responses for functional validation. A total of 574 DNA samples were genotyped, including 176 DF, 135 DHF, 143 other non-dengue febrile illnesses (OFI) and 120 population controls. A strong association between GG/AG genotypes of rs4804803 and risk of DHF was found when compared among DF, OFI and controls (p = 0.004, 3x10(-5) and 0.001, respectively). The AA genotype was associated with protection against dengue infection compared with OFI and controls (p = 0.002 and 0.020, respectively). Moreover, MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype with a higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression had a significantly higher TNF alpha, IL-12p40, and IP-10 production than those with AA genotype in response to dengue infection. However, the viral replication in MDDCs with AG genotype was significantly lower than those with AA genotype. With both genotypes, MDDCs revealed an increase in viral replication following the addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody.
   Conclusions/Significance: The rs4804803 SNP in the CD209 promoter contributed to susceptibility to dengue infection and complication of DHF. This SNP with AG genotype affects the cell surface DC-SIGN expression related to immune augmentation and less viral replication.

TI Geo-spatial Hotspots of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome and

AB Background: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is highly endemic in mainland China, and has extended from rural areas to cities recently. Beijing metropolis is a novel affected region, where the HFRS incidence seems to be diverse from place to place.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The spatial scan analysis based on geographical information system (GIS) identified three geo-spatial "hotspots" of HFRS in Beijing when the passive surveillance data from 2004 to 2006 were used. The Relative Risk (RR) of the three "hotspots" was 5.45, 3.57 and 3.30, respectively. The Phylogenetic analysis based on entire coding region sequence of S segment and partial L segment sequence of Seoul virus (SEOV) revealed that the SEOV strains circulating in Beijing could be classified into at least three lineages regardless of their host origins. Two potential recombination events that happened in lineage #1 were detected and supported by comparative phylogenetic analysis. The SEOV strains in different lineages and strains with distinct special amino acid substitutions for N protein were partially associated with different spatial clustered areas of HFRS.
   Conclusion/Significance: Hotspots of HFRS were found in Beijing, a novel endemic region, where intervention should be enhanced. Our data suggested that the genetic variation and recombination of SEOV strains was related to the high risk areas of HFRS, which merited further investigation.

TI Transmission Dynamics of Borrelia lusitaniae and Borrelia afzelii Among
   Ixodes ricinus, Lizards, and Mice in Tuscany, Central Italy
AB To estimate the basic reproduction number (R-0) of Borrelia lusitaniae and Borrelia afzelii, we formulated a mathematical model considering the interactions among the tick vector, vertebrate hosts, and pathogens in a 500-ha enclosed natural reserve on Le Cerbaie hills, Tuscany, central Italy. In the study area, Ixodes ricinus were abundant and were found infected by B. lusitaniae and B. afzelii. Lizards (Podarcis spp.) and mice (Apodemus spp.), respectively, are the reservoir hosts of these two Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) genospecies and compete for immature ticks. B. lusitaniae R-0 estimation is in agreement with field observations, indicating the maintenance and diffusion of this genospecies in the study area, where lizards are abundant and highly infested by I. ricinus immature stages. In fact, B. lusitaniae shows a focal distribution in areas where the tick vector and the vertebrate reservoir coexist. Mouse population dynamics and their relatively low suitability as hosts for nymphs seem to determine, on the other hand, a less efficient transmission of B. afzelii, whose R-0 differs between scenarios in the study area. Considering host population dynamics, the proposed model suggests that, given a certain combination of the two host population sizes, both spirochete genospecies can coexist in our study area. Additional incompetent hosts for B. burgdorferi s.l. have a negative effect on B. afzelii maintenance, whose R-0 results > 1 only with high mouse population densities and/or low lizards abundance, but they do not seem to influence B. lusitaniae transmission cycle on Le Cerbaie. Secondly, our model confirms the importance of nymphs' infestation, of host population density and diversity, and spirochetes host association for the maintenance of the transmission cycle of B. burgdorferi s.l.

TI Modeling the Dynamic Transmission of Dengue Fever: Investigating Disease
   Persistence
AB Background: Dengue is a disease of great complexity, due to interactions between humans, mosquitoes and various virus serotypes as well as efficient vector survival strategies. Thus, understanding the factors influencing the persistence of the disease has been a challenge for scientists and policy makers. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of various factors related to humans and vectors in the maintenance of viral transmission during extended periods.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a stochastic cellular automata model to simulate the spread of dengue fever in a dense community. Each cell can correspond to a built area, and human and mosquito populations are individually monitored during the simulations. Human mobility and renewal, as well as vector infestation, are taken into consideration. To investigate the factors influencing the maintenance of viral circulation, two sets of simulations were performed: (1(st)) varying human renewal rates and human population sizes and (2(nd)) varying the house index (fraction of infested buildings) and vector per human ratio. We found that viral transmission is inhibited with the combination of small human populations with low renewal rates. It is also shown that maintenance of viral circulation for extended periods is possible at low values of house index. Based on the results of the model and on a study conducted in the city of Recife, Brazil, which associates vector infestation with Aedes aegytpi egg counts, we question the current methodology used in calculating the house index, based on larval survey.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study contributed to a better understanding of the dynamics of dengue subsistence. Using basic concepts of metapopulations, we concluded that low infestation rates in a few neighborhoods ensure the persistence of dengue in large cities and suggested that better strategies should be implemented to obtain measures of house index values, in order to improve the dengue monitoring and control system.

TI Pathogen-induced rapid evolution in a vertebrate life-history trait
AB Anthropogenic factors, including climate warming, are increasing the incidence and prevalence of infectious diseases worldwide. Infectious diseases caused by pathogenic parasites can have severe impacts on host survival, thereby altering the selection regime and inducing evolutionary responses in their hosts. Knowledge about such evolutionary consequences in natural populations is critical to mitigate potential ecological and economic effects. However, studies on pathogen-induced trait changes are scarce and the pace of evolutionary change is largely unknown, particularly in vertebrates. Here, we use a time series from long-term monitoring of perch to estimate temporal trends in the maturation schedule before and after a severe pathogen outbreak. We show that the disease induced a phenotypic change from a previously increasing to a decreasing size at maturation, the most important life-history transition in animals. Evolutionary rates imposed by the pathogen were high and comparable to those reported for populations exposed to intense human harvesting. Pathogens thus represent highly potent drivers of adaptive phenotypic evolution in vertebrates.

TI Sources of variation in dietary requirements in an obligate nutritional
   symbiosis
AB The nutritional symbiosis between aphids and their obligate symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, is often characterized as a highly functional partnership in which the symbiont provides the host with essential nutrients. Despite this, some aphid lineages exhibit dietary requirements for nutrients typically synthesized by Buchnera, suggesting that some aspect of the symbiosis is disrupted. To examine this phenomenon in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, populations were assayed using defined artificial diet to determine dietary requirements for essential amino acids (EAAs). Six clones exhibiting dependence on EAAs in their diet were investigated further. In one aphid clone, a mutation in a Buchnera amino acid biosynthesis gene could account for the clone's requirement for dietary arginine. Analysis of aphid F(1) hybrids allowed separation of effects of the host and symbiont genomes, and revealed that both affect the requirement for dietary EAAs in the clones tested. Amino acid requirements were minimally affected by secondary symbiont infection. Our results indicate that variation among pea aphids in dependence on dietary amino acids can result from Buchnera mutation as well as variation in the host genotype.

TI Absolute Humidity and Pandemic Versus Epidemic Influenza
AB Experimental and epidemiologic evidence indicates that variations of absolute humidity account for the onset and seasonal cycle of epidemic influenza in temperate regions. A role for absolute humidity in the transmission of pandemic influenza, such as 2009 A/H1N1, has yet to be demonstrated and, indeed, outbreaks of pandemic influenza during more humid spring, summer, and autumn months might appear to constitute evidence against an effect of humidity. However, here the authors show that variations of the basic and effective reproductive numbers for influenza, caused by seasonal changes in absolute humidity, are consistent with the general timing of pandemic influenza outbreaks observed for 2009 A/H1N1 in temperate regions, as well as wintertime transmission of epidemic influenza. Indeed, absolute humidity conditions correctly identify the region of the United States vulnerable to a third, wintertime wave of pandemic influenza. These findings suggest that the timing of pandemic influenza outbreaks is controlled by a combination of absolute humidity conditions, levels of susceptibility, and changes in population-mixing and contact rates.

TI The Human Fetal Immune Response to Hepatitis C Virus Exposure in Utero
AB Background. Although the rate of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is low, the effect of HCV exposure in utero on the fetal immune system is unknown.
   Methods. Umbilical cord blood was obtained from 7 neonates born to HCV-seropositive, HCV RNA-positive women and 8 neonates born to HCV-seronegative women. Cord blood mononuclear cells were analyzed by immunophenotyping and by intracellular cytokine staining after HCV-specific and polyclonal stimulation. Plasma was analyzed for anti-HCV immunoglobulin M (IgM), cytokine/granzyme concentrations, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity.
   Results. HCV-exposed neonates had significantly lower levels of regulatory T cells expressing HLA-DR, lower CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell activation, and lower plasma levels of pro-inflammatory markers than did controls. However, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from HCV-exposed neonates had higher IFN-gamma production in response to polyclonal stimulation than did T cells from controls. IDO activity was similar between groups. No HCV-specific T cell responses or anti-HCV IgM were detected in any neonates.
   Conclusions. HCV-exposed neonates showed a relative suppression of immune activation and pro-inflammatory markers, which was counterbalanced by an increased production capacity for IFN-gamma. These results suggest that HCV encounters the fetal immune system in utero, and alters the balance between suppressive and pro-inflammatory responses.

TI Antagonistic coevolution with parasites maintains host genetic
   diversity: an experimental test
AB Genetic variation in natural populations is a prime prerequisite allowing populations to respond to selection, but is under constant threat from forces that tend to reduce it, such as genetic drift and many types of selection. Haldane emphasized the potential importance of parasites as a driving force of genetic diversity. His theory has been taken for granted ever since, but despite numerous studies showing correlations between genetic diversity and parasitism, Haldane's hypothesis has rarely been tested experimentally for unambiguous support. We experimentally staged antagonistic coevolution between the host Tribolium castaneum and its natural microsporidian parasite, Nosema whitei, to test for the relative importance of two separate evolutionary forces (drift and parasite-induced selection) on the maintenance of genetic variation. Our results demonstrate that coevolution with parasites indeed counteracts drift as coevolving populations had significantly higher levels of heterozygosity and allelic diversity. Genetic drift remained a strong force, strongly reducing genetic variation and increasing genetic differentiation in small populations. To our surprise, differentiation between the evolving populations was smaller when they coevolved with parasites, suggesting parallel balancing selection. Hence, our results experimentally vindicate Haldane's original hypothesis 60 years after its conception.

TI An enzootic vector-borne virus is amplified at epizootic levels by an
   invasive avian host
AB Determining the effect of an invasive species on enzootic pathogen dynamics is critical for understanding both human epidemics and wildlife epizootics. Theoretical models suggest that when a naive species enters an established host-parasite system, the new host may either reduce ('dilute') or increase ('spillback') pathogen transmission to native hosts. There are few empirical data to evaluate these possibilities, especially for animal pathogens. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that is enzootically transmitted by the swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius) to colonially nesting cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota). In western Nebraska, introduced house sparrows (Passer domesticus) invaded cliff swallow colonies approximately 40 years ago and were exposed to BCRV. We evaluated how the addition of house sparrows to this host-parasite system affected the prevalence and amplification of a bird-associated BCRV lineage. The infection prevalence in house sparrows was eight times that of cliff swallows. Nestling house sparrows in mixed-species colonies were significantly less likely to be infected than sparrows in single-species colonies. Infected house sparrows circulated BCRV at higher viraemia titres than cliff swallows. BCRV detected in bug vectors at a site was positively associated with virus prevalence in house sparrows but not with virus prevalence in cliff swallows. The addition of a highly susceptible invasive host species has led to perennial BCRV epizootics at cliff swallow colony sites. The native cliff swallow host confers a dilution advantage to invasive sparrow hosts in mixed colonies, while at the same sites house sparrows may increase the likelihood that swallows become infected.

TI Host plant quality, selection history and trade-offs shape the immune
   responses of Manduca sexta
AB Immune defences are an important component of fitness. Yet susceptibility to pathogens is common, suggesting the presence of ecological and evolutionary limitations on immune defences. Here, we use structural equation modelling to quantify the direct effects of resource quality and selection history, and their indirect effects mediated via body condition prior to an immune challenge on encapsulation and melanization immune defences in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. We also investigate allocation trade-offs among immune defences and growth rate following an immune challenge. We found considerable variation in the magnitude and direction of the direct effects of resource quality and selection history on immune defences and their indirect effects mediated via body condition and allocation trade-offs. Greater resource quality and evolutionary exposure to pathogens had positive direct effects on encapsulation and melanization. The indirect effect of resource quality on encapsulation mediated via body condition was substantial, whereas indirect effects on melanization were negligible. Individuals in better condition prior to the immune challenge had greater encapsulation; however, following the immune challenge, greater encapsulation traded off with slower growth rate. Our study demonstrates the importance of experimentally and analytically disentangling the relative contributions of direct and indirect effects to understand variation in immune defences.

We report the analyses of the transmission-blocking (TB) activity of sera collected from 105 Plasmodium vivax-infected and 44 non-infected individuals from a malaria endemic region of Colombia, using a membrane feeding assay in Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes. In infected donors we found that TB activity was antibody dose dependent (35%), lasted for 2-4 months after infection, and in 70% of the cases different P vivax wild isolates displayed differential susceptibility to blocking antibodies. Additionally, in a number of assays TB was complement-dependent. Twenty-seven percent of non-infected individuals presented TB activity that correlated with antibody titers. Studies here provide preliminary data on factors of great importance for further work on the development of TB vaccines.

TI Modeling the Relationship between Precipitation and Malaria Incidence in
   Children from a Holoendemic Area in Ghana
AB Climatic factors influence the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. They modify the abundance of mosquito populations, the length of the extrinsic parasite cycle in the mosquito, the malarial dynamics, and the emergence of epidemics in areas of low endemicity. The objective of this study was to investigate temporal associations between weekly malaria incidence in 1,993 children <15 years of age and weekly rainfall. A time series analysis was conducted by using cross-correlation function and autoregressive modeling. The regression model showed that the level of rainfall predicted the malaria incidence after a time lag of 9 weeks (mean = 60 days) and after a time lag between one and two weeks. The analyses provide evidence that high-resolution precipitation data can directly predict malaria incidence in a highly endemic area. Such models might enable the development of early warning systems and support intervention measures.

AB Threats to native forests from non-native insects and pathogens (pests) are generally addressed with methods such as quarantine, eradication, biological control, and development of resistant stock through hybridization and breeding. In conjunction with such efforts, it may be useful to have citizen scientists locate rare surviving trees that may be naturally pest resistant or tolerant. The degree of resistance of individual trees identified in this way can be tested under controlled conditions, and the most resistant individuals can be integrated into plant breeding programs aimed at developing pest-resistant native stock. Involving citizen scientists in programs aimed at identifying rare trees that survive colonization by pests provides a low-cost means of maximizing search efforts across wide geographic regions and may provide an effective supplement to existing management approaches.

TI Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to
   consumer-resource modelling
AB P>An approach to modelling food web biomass flows among live and dead compartments within and among species is formulated using metaphysiological principles that characterise population growth in terms of basal metabolism, feeding, senescence and exploitation. This leads to a unified approach to modelling interactions among plants, herbivores, carnivores, scavengers, parasites and their resources. Also, dichotomising sessile miners from mobile gatherers of resources, with relevance to feeding and starvation time scales, suggests a new classification scheme involving 10 primary categories of consumer types. These types, in various combinations, rigorously distinguish scavenger from parasite, herbivory from phytophagy and detritivore from decomposer. Application of the approach to particular consumer-resource interactions is demonstrated, culminating in the construction of an anthrax-centred food web model, with parameters applicable to Etosha National Park, Namibia, where deaths of elephants and zebra from the bacterial pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, provide significant subsidies to jackals, vultures and other scavengers.

   host reveals extreme genotype-genotype interactions
AB P>The degree of specificity in host-parasite interactions has important implications for ecology and evolution. Unfortunately, specificity can be difficult to determine when parasites cannot be cultured. In such cases, studies often use isolates of unknown genetic composition, which may lead to an underestimation of specificity. We obtained the first clones of the unculturable bacterium Pasteuria ramosa, a parasite of Daphnia magna. Clonal genotypes of the parasite exhibited much more specific interactions with host genotypes than previous studies using isolates. Clones of P. ramosa infected fewer D. magna genotypes than isolates and host clones were either fully susceptible or fully resistant to the parasite. Our finding enhances our understanding of the evolution of virulence and coevolutionary dynamics in this system. We recommend caution when using P. ramosa isolates as the presence of multiple genotypes may influence the outcome and interpretation of some experiments.

TI PARTIAL RESISTANCE IN THE LINUM-MELAMPSORA HOST-PATHOGEN SYSTEM: DOES
   PARTIAL RESISTANCE MAKE THE RED QUEEN RUN SLOWER?
AB Five levels of disease expression were scored in a cross-inoculation study of 120 host and 60 pathogen lines of wild flax Linum marginale and its rust fungus Melampsora lini sampled from six natural populations. Patterns of partial resistance showed clear evidence of gene-for-gene interactions, with particular levels of partial resistance occurring in specific host-pathogen combinations. Sympatric and putatively more highly coevolved host-pathogen combinations had a lower frequency of partial resistance types relative to allopatric combinations. Sympatric host-pathogen combinations also showed a lower diversity of resistance responses, but there was a trend toward a greater fraction of this variance being determined by pathogen-genotype x host-genotype interactions. In this system, there was no evidence that partial resistances slow host-pathogen coevolution. The analyses show that if variation is generated by among population host or pathogen dispersal, then coevolution occurs largely by pathogens overcoming the partial resistances that are generated.

TI Fitness consequences of immune responses: strengthening the empirical
   framework for ecoimmunology
AB P>1. Ecoimmunologists aim to understand the costs, benefits, and net fitness consequences of different strategies for immune defense.
   2. Measuring the fitness consequences of immune responses is difficult, partly because of complex relationships between host fitness and the within-host density of parasites and immunological cells or molecules. In particular, neither the strongest immune responses nor the lowest parasite densities necessarily maximize host fitness.
   3. Here, we propose that ecoimmunologists should routinely endeavour to measure three intertwined parameters: host fitness, parasite density, and relevant immune responses. We further propose that analyses of relationships among these traits would benefit from the statistical machinery used for analyses of phenotypic plasticity and/or methods that are robust to the bi-directional causation inherent in host-parasite relationships. For example, analyses of how host fitness depends upon parasite density, which is an evolutionary ecological definition of tolerance, would benefit from these more robust methods.
   4. Together, these steps promote rigorous quantification of the fitness consequences of immune responses. Such quantification is essential if ecoimmunologists are to decipher causes of immune polymorphism in nature and predict trajectories of natural selection on immune defense.

TI Disease ecology meets ecological immunology: understanding the links
   between organismal immunity and infection dynamics in natural
   populations
AB P>1. Ecological immunology and disease ecology are two relatively young disciplines that apply ecological approaches and principles to traditionally non-ecological fields. In both cases, an ecological perspective has allowed new insights to emerge by focusing attention on variation over space and time, and by emphasizing the role of the environment in shaping individual responses and the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. Here we review the growing conceptual interface between these two rapidly evolving fields.
   2. Areas of synergy between ecological immunology and disease ecology aim to translate variation in within-host processes (e.g. immunity) into between-host dynamics (e.g. parasite transmission). Emerging areas of synergy include potential immune mechanisms that underlie host heterogeneity in disease susceptibility, teasing apart the effects of environmental factors such as seasonality and climate on host susceptibility and pathogen dynamics, and predicting the outcome of co-infection by functionally distinct groups of parasites that elicit different immune responses.
   3. In some cases, practical limitations have constrained the merging of ideas in ecological immunology and disease ecology. We discuss several logistical challenges, including dissecting the relative roles of host exposure and susceptibility, establishing links between measures of immunity and pathogen resistance in wild populations, and incorporating relevant immune variation into prevailing disease ecology modeling frameworks.
   4. Future work at the interface of these two fields should advance understanding of life-history theory, host-pathogen dynamics, and physiological ecology, and will also contribute to targeted approaches for wildlife health and zoonotic disease prevention.

TI The role of constraints and limitation in driving individual variation
   in immune response
AB P>1. Life history theory predicts that immunity should be plastic and reflect environmental contexts. However, individual variation in immune investment may arise not just because of individual adjustment, but because of developmental, physiological, genetic or immunological constraints which lead to non-adaptive responses by limiting or eliminating flexibility in immune investment. Constraints can arise because organisms are single integrated units with interconnected and interacting components, in which physiological and genetic control mechanisms may limit or constrain immunity. We review some of the key underlying genetic and physiological factors that may constrain the occurrence and intensity of immune responses.
   2. A major part of individual variability may rest on variation in genetic background. Genetic-based constraints can limit or influence immune responses, particularly through pleiotropy and epistatic interactions. In addition, genetic variation, an important driver of variation in antigen recognition and immune system polarization, can be constrained through linkage disequilibrium and genetic drift. Epigenetic changes can also constrain or limit immune responses in future generations based on individual experience.
   3. The immune system itself can influence individual flexibility in immune investment. Throughout development individuals face tradeoffs within the immune system that favour the expression of one trait at the expense of another. Ontogenetic differences can cause juveniles and adults to produce entirely different immune responses to the same pathogen. T-helper 1 (Th1)/T-helper 1 (Th2) polarization during infection also imposes constraints upon an individual's immune responsiveness, with the consequence that hosts cannot simultaneously mount strong responses using both Th1 and Th2 cells. In addition, evidence suggests that flexibility in immune responses becomes constrained with age through accumulation of memory cells at the expense of naive cells, decreased function of cells involved in adaptive and innate immunity, and programming of HPA-immune interactions.
   4. In summary, selection on a particular immune trait can have effects on other immune components or phenotypic characters, as revealed by artificial selection studies. In particular selection for increased investment in compartments of the immune system leads to decreased investment in other competing life history functions and/or marked changes in other immune components. The role of past experience, even the past experience of parents, may limit and constrain immune responses through influencing the ontogeny of immunity, as well as through epigenetic influences.

TI Outdoor immunology: methodological considerations for ecologists
AB P>1. Immune defence is an incredibly complicated system, but to understand how it functions in an ecological context is challenging. Our focus is to outline the diversity of ways to measure immune function for ecologists, and to provide some details on the limitations in interpretation of results.
   2. There are two broad questions that ecological immunologists have to deal with. The first is what assays are appropriate for the research question of interest? Some researchers assume the biological relevance of an immune assay without investigation or a complete understanding of the immune response. Therefore, the second question is, what parasite challenge does one choose, and does a measurement of immune function reflect the response of the host towards that parasite? There are many assumptions, caveats, and pitfalls facing ecological immunologists, and investigating the relationships between immune assays and whole organismal defence will help us to understand variations in immune responses.
   3. We provide an extensive listing of immune function measures, presenting examples from both the vertebrate and invertebrate literature, and wherever possible from non-model organisms. We also outline how these responses are part of an integrated immune defence and encourage thinking about immune function as a hierarchical defence model. We describe how immune responses interact with one another, identify concerns regarding when to measure an immune response, and describe general problems faced when trying to collect a measure of immune function in wild organisms.
   4. Extrinsic factors influence immune measurements and the importance of parasites is often overlooked. We give several examples of how parasites interact with organism's immune systems, suggest greater inclusion of parasites into ecological immunology experiments, describe how micro-organisms may interact symbiotically with their host's immune system, and advocate the inclusion of tolerance and resistance in ecological immunological thinking.

TI Macronutrient balance mediates trade-offs between immune function and
   life history traits
AB P>1. Diet and health are intimately linked and recent studies have found that caloric restriction can affect immune function. However, when given a choice between diets that differ in their macronutrient composition, pathogen-infected individuals can select a diet that improves their survival, suggesting that the nutritional composition of the diet, as well as its calorie content, can play a role in defence against disease. Moreover, as individuals change their diet when infected, it suggests that a diet that is optimal for growth is not optimal for immunity, leading to trade-offs.
   2. Currently, our knowledge of the effects of diet on immunity is limited because previous experiments have manipulated either single nutrients or the calorie content of the diet without considering their interactive effects. By simultaneously manipulating both the diet composition (quality) and its caloric density (quantity), in both naive and immune-challenged insects, we asked how do diet quality and quantity influence an individual's ability to mount an immune response? And to what extent are allocation trade-offs driven by quantity- versus quality-based constraints?
   3. We restricted individuals to 20 diets varying in their protein and carbohydrate content and used 3D response surfaces to visualize dietary effects on larval growth and immune traits. Our results show that both constitutive and induced immune responses are not limited by the total quantity of nutrients consumed, but rather different traits respond differently to variation in the ratios of macronutrients (diet quality), and peak in different regions of macronutrient space. The preferred dietary composition therefore represents a compromise between the nutritional requirements of growth and immune responses. We also show that a non-pathogenic immune challenge does not affect diet choice, rather immune-challenged insects modify their allocation of nutrients to improve their immune response.
   4. Our results indicate that immune traits are affected by the macronutrient content of the diet and that no diet can simultaneously optimize all components of the immune system. To date the emphasis has been on the effects of micronutrients in improving immunity, our findings indicate that this must be widened to include the neglected impact of macronutrients on defence against disease.

TI Assessing spatial patterns of disease risk to biodiversity: implications
   for the management of the amphibian pathogen, Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis
AB P>1. Emerging infectious diseases can have serious consequences for wildlife populations, ecosystem structure and biodiversity. Predicting the spatial patterns and potential impacts of diseases in free-ranging wildlife are therefore important for planning, prioritizing and implementing research and management actions.
   2. We developed spatial models of environmental suitability (ES) for infection with the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the most significant disease affecting vertebrate biodiversity on record, amphibian chytridiomycosis. We applied relatively newly developed methods for modelling ES (Maxent) to the first comprehensive, continent-wide data base (comprising > 10000 observations) on the occurrence of infection with this pathogen and employed novel methodologies to deal with common but rarely addressed sources of model uncertainty.
   3. We used ES to (i) predict the minimum potential geographic distribution of infection with B. dendrobatidis in Australia and (ii) test the hypothesis that ES for B. dendrobatidis should help explain patterns of amphibian decline given its theoretical and empirical link with organism abundance (intensity of infection), a known determinant of disease severity.
   4. We show that (i) infection with B. dendrobatidis has probably reached its broad geographic limits in Australia under current climatic conditions but that smaller areas of invasion potential remain, (ii) areas of high predicted ES for B. dendrobatidis accurately reflect areas where population declines due to severe chytridiomycosis have occurred and (iii) that a host-specific metric of ES for B. dendrobatidis (ES for Bd(species)) is the strongest predictor of decline in Australian amphibians at a continental scale yet discovered.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide quantitative information that helps to explain both the spatial distribution and potential effects (risk) of amphibian infection with B. dendrobatidis at the population level. Given scarce conservation resources, our results can be used immediately in Australia and our methods applied elsewhere to prioritize species, regions and actions in the struggle to limit further biodiversity loss.

TI Modelling the future distribution of the amphibian chytrid fungus: the
   influence of climate and human-associated factors
AB P>1. Many of the global losses of amphibians are believed to be caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Hence, determining its present and future environmental suitability should help to inform management and surveillance of this pathogen and curtail the amphibian biodiversity crisis.
   2. In this issue of Journal of Applied Ecology, Murray et al. (2010) offer an important step in this direction by providing a species distribution model that projects the environmental suitability of Bd across Australia and predicts locations of chytridiomycosis and amphibian declines. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis presence was predicted by diurnal temperature range (a measure of temperature variability) and mean precipitation. Human population density, a positive predictor of Bd, accounted for the most variation when removed from the statistical model.
   3. This work represents an invaluable case study and has great potential for managing chytridiomycosis and associated amphibian declines, but its value in practice will depend on how well managers understand the limitations of species distribution models.
   4.Synthesis and applications. To improve the management of chytridiomycosis, amphibian-chytrid research should attempt to understand how humans may affect the distribution of Bd, how climatic means and variances affect Bd transmission, how much variation in the distribution of Bd is unique to and shared among climate, human, and other factors, whether human-related factors and climate statistically interact, and how these potentially correlated factors and any interactions affect the predictability of species distribution models. In response to the swift spread of Bd and our rapidly changing planet, we encourage the application of Bd distribution models to other regions of the globe and predictions of Bd's distribution under future climate change scenarios.

TI The potential effect of exotic Pacific rats Rattus exulans on vectors of
   scrub typhus
AB P>1. The role and influence of exotic species in indigenous vector-borne diseases are important but remain understudied. Ascertaining whether disease vectors prefer exotic vs. native hosts has important implications for human health. Moreover, evaluating whether exotic hosts are intrinsically less susceptible to vectors, or whether vector loads can vary with environment, is instructive for possible disease dynamics in the face of range expansion of exotic species. Rattus exulans has recently been recorded for the first time in eastern Taiwan, where scrub typhus is prevalent. We assessed the role of R. exulans as a host for chiggers (larval trombiculid mites), and the degree to which vector loads of R. exulans exhibited spatial variation.
   2. We deployed live traps in two villages in Taiwan that differed in human population density and in the incidence of scrub typhus. We recovered and tallied chiggers from small mammals, and identified over one-fifth of chiggers from each host to species. Chiggers were assayed for Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT) infection with nested-PCR.
   3. R. exulans was the most common small mammal species captured (31 center dot 4% total captures), and supported about one-fifth of total chiggers recovered. Leptotrombidium imphalum dominated the chigger assemblage of most native species (> 90%), but Gahrliepia spp. was commonly found in R. exulans (39 center dot 1%). We detected OT in the genus Leptotrombidium (39%) but not in the Gahrliepia. Prevalence and loads of chiggers in R. exulans were about 5x and 17x higher, respectively, in the less densely populated village; a similar trend also occurred with native R. losea.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Currently, R. exulans appears to play a relatively minor role in supporting chiggers. However, the fact that both prevalence and loads of chiggers in R. exulans vary greatly with environment, along with the abundance of most exotic species and the ecological flexibility of R. exulans, implies a potential health risk as this species expands to areas with more chiggers. Our study suggests that a clearer understanding of interactions among native and exotic hosts and native parasite species can facilitate prediction of the impact of exotic hosts on the dynamics of vector-borne diseases.

TI Transmission mode affects the population genetic structure of Daphnia
   parasites
AB Parasite life cycle variation can shape parasite evolution, by predisposing them towards different population genetic structures. We compared the population genetic structure of two co-occurring parasite species of Daphnia, to collect evidence for their expected transmission modes. The ichthyosporean Caullerya mesnili has a direct life cycle, whereas the microsporidian Berwaldia schaefernai is hypothesized to require passage through a secondary host. The parasites were collected from three geographically isolated Daphnia populations. The nucleotide variation in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was assessed at the within-individual, within-population and among-population levels, using amova. We detected significant partitioning at all levels, except for a lack of among-population variation in Berwaldia. This was confirmed by neighbour-joining and principal component analyses; Caullerya populations were distinct from each other, while there was much overlap among parasite isolates representing different populations of Berwaldia. This all implies a higher amount of gene flow for Berwaldia, consistent with the hypothesized transmission mode.

TI Maternal Tuberculosis: A Risk Factor for Mother-to-Child Transmission of
   Human Immunodeficiency Virus
AB Background. Maternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA load, CD4 cell count, breast-feeding, antiretroviral use, and malaria are well-established factors associated with mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV; the role of maternal tuberculosis (TB), however, has not been well established.
   Methods. The study population was 783 HIV-infected Indian mother-infant pair participants in randomized and ancillary HIV-infected cohorts of the Six Week Extended-Dose Nevirapine (SWEN) Study, a study comparing extended nevirapine versus single-dose nevirapine, to reduce MTCT of HIV among breast-fed infants. Using multivariable logistic regression, we assessed the impact of maternal TB occurring during pregnancy and through 12 months after delivery on risk of MTCT.
   Results. Of 783 mothers, 3 had prevalent TB and 30 had incident TB at 12 months after delivery. Of 33 mothers with TB, 10 (30%) transmitted HIV to their infants in comparison with 87 of 750 mothers without TB (12%; odds ratio [OR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-7.29; P = .02). In multivariable analysis, maternal TB was associated with 2.51-fold (95% CI, 1.05-6.02; P = .04) increased odds of HIV transmission adjusting for maternal factors (viral load, CD4 cell count, and antiretroviral therapy) and infant factors (breast-feeding duration, infant nevirapine administration, gestational age, and birth weight) associated with MTCT of HIV.
   Conclusions. Maternal TB is associated with increased MTCT of HIV. Prevention of TB among HIV-infected mothers should be a high priority for communities with significant HIV/TB burden.

TI Emerging opportunistic yeast infections
AB A growing population of immunosuppressed patients has resulted in increasingly frequent diagnoses of invasive fungal infections, including those caused by unusual yeasts. The incidence of non-albicans species of Candida is increasing compared with that of Candida albicans, and several species, such as Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, may be resistant to azole antifungal therapy. Trichosporon species are the second most common cause of fungaemia in patients with haematological malignant disease and are characterised by resistance to amphotericin and echinocandins and poor prognosis. Rhodotorula species belong to the family Cryptococcaceae, and are a cause of catheter-related fungaemia, sepsis, and invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients. An increasing number of sporadic cases of invasive fungal infections by non-neoformans cryptococci have been reported in immunocompromised hosts, especially for patients with advanced HIV infection or cancer who are undergoing transplant. Other uncommon yeasts that can cause invasive disease in severely immunosuppressed patients include Geotrichum, Hansenula, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces. Host immune status is a crucial determinant of the type of invasive fungal infection a patient is at risk for. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies heavily on traditional cultures of blood and other sterile sites, although serum (1,3)-beta-D-glucan testing might have an adjunctive role. Although rare yeasts are emerging as opportunistic human pathogens, diagnosis remains challenging and treatment suboptimal.

TI Evolutionary criteria outperform operational approaches in producing
   ecologically relevant fungal species inventories
AB Analyses of the structure and function of microbial communities are highly constrained by the diversity of organisms present within most environmental samples. A common approach is to rely almost entirely on DNA sequence data for estimates of microbial diversity, but to date there is no objective method of clustering sequences into groups that is grounded in evolutionary theory of what constitutes a biological lineage. The general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model uses a likelihood-based approach to distinguish population-level processes within lineages from processes associated with speciation and extinction, thus identifying a distinct point where extant lineages became independent. Using two independent surveys of DNA sequences associated with a group of ubiquitous plant-symbiotic fungi, we compared estimates of species richness derived using the GMYC model to those based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined by fixed levels of sequence similarity. The model predicted lower species richness in these surveys than did traditional methods of sequence similarity. Here, we show for the first time that groups delineated by the GMYC model better explained variation in the distribution of fungi in relation to putative niche-based variables associated with host species identity, edaphic factors, and aspects of how the sampled ecosystems were managed. Our results suggest the coalescent-based GMYC model successfully groups environmental sequences of fungi into clusters that are ecologically more meaningful than more arbitrary approaches for estimating species richness.

TI First Principles Modeling of Nonlinear Incidence Rates in Seasonal
   Epidemics
AB In this paper we used a general stochastic processes framework to derive from first principles the incidence rate function that characterizes epidemic models. We investigate a particular case, the Liu-Hethcote-van den Driessche's (LHD) incidence rate function, which results from modeling the number of successful transmission encounters as a pure birth process. This derivation also takes into account heterogeneity in the population with regard to the per individual transmission probability. We adjusted a deterministic SIRS model with both the classical and the LHD incidence rate functions to time series of the number of children infected with syncytial respiratory virus in Banjul, Gambia and Turku, Finland. We also adjusted a deterministic SEIR model with both incidence rate functions to the famous measles data sets from the UK cities of London and Birmingham. Two lines of evidence supported our conclusion that the model with the LHD incidence rate may very well be a better description of the seasonal epidemic processes studied here. First, our model was repeatedly selected as best according to two different information criteria and two different likelihood formulations. The second line of evidence is qualitative in nature: contrary to what the SIRS model with classical incidence rate predicts, the solution of the deterministic SIRS model with LHD incidence rate will reach either the disease free equilibrium or the endemic equilibrium depending on the initial conditions. These findings along with computer intensive simulations of the models' Poincare map with environmental stochasticity contributed to attain a clear separation of the roles of the environmental forcing and the mechanics of the disease transmission in shaping seasonal epidemics dynamics.

TI Mapping Protein Interactions between Dengue Virus and Its Human and
   Insect Hosts
AB Background: Dengue fever is an increasingly significant arthropod-borne viral disease, with at least 50 million cases per year worldwide. As with other viral pathogens, dengue virus is dependent on its host to perform the bulk of functions necessary for viral survival and replication. To be successful, dengue must manipulate host cell biological processes towards its own ends, while avoiding elimination by the immune system. Protein-protein interactions between the virus and its host are one avenue through which dengue can connect and exploit these host cellular pathways and processes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We implemented a computational approach to predict interactions between Dengue virus (DENV) and both of its hosts, Homo sapiens and the insect vector Aedes aegypti. Our approach is based on structural similarity between DENV and host proteins and incorporates knowledge from the literature to further support a subset of the predictions. We predict over 4,000 interactions between DENV and humans, as well as 176 interactions between DENV and A. aegypti. Additional filtering based on shared Gene Ontology cellular component annotation reduced the number of predictions to approximately 2,000 for humans and 18 for A. aegypti. Of 19 experimentally validated interactions between DENV and humans extracted from the literature, this method was able to predict nearly half (9). Additional predictions suggest specific interactions between virus and host proteins relevant to interferon signaling, transcriptional regulation, stress, and the unfolded protein response.
   Conclusions/Significance: Dengue virus manipulates cellular processes to its advantage through specific interactions with the host's protein interaction network. The interaction networks presented here provide a set of hypothesis for further experimental investigation into the DENV life cycle as well as potential therapeutic targets.

TI Borrelia burgdorferi Has Minimal Impact on the Lyme Disease Reservoir
   Host Peromyscus leucopus
AB The epidemiology of vector-borne zoonotic diseases is determined by encounter rates between vectors and hosts. Alterations to the behavior of reservoir hosts caused by the infectious agent have the potential to dramatically alter disease transmission and human risk. We examined the effect of Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, on one of its most important reservoir hosts, the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. We mimic natural infections in mice using the vector (Black-legged ticks, Ixodes scapularis) and examine the immunological and behavioral responses of mouse hosts. Despite producing antibodies against B. burgdorferi, infected mice did not have elevated white blood cells compared with uninfected mice. In addition, infected and uninfected mice did not differ in their wheel-running activity. Our results suggest that infection with the spirochete B. burgdorferi has little impact on the field activity of white-footed mice. Lyme disease transmission appears to be uncomplicated by pathogen-altered behavior of this reservoir host.

TI Strain filtering and transmission of a mixed infection in a social
   insect
AB Mixed-genotype infections have attracted considerable attention as drivers of pathogen evolution. However, experimental approaches often overlook essential features of natural host-parasite interactions, such as host heterogeneity, or the effects of between-host selection during transmission. Here, following inoculation of a mixed infection, we analyse the success of different strains of a trypanosome parasite throughout the colony cycle of its bumblebee host. We find that most colonies efficiently filter the circulating infection before it reaches the new queens, the only offspring that carry infections to the next season. A few colonies with a poor filtering ability thus contributed disproportionately to the parasite population in the next season. High strain diversity but not high infection intensity within colony was associated with an increased probability of transmission of the infection to new queens. Interestingly, the representation of the different strains changed dramatically over time, so that long-term parasite success could not be predicted from short-term observations. These findings highlight the shaping of within-colony parasite diversity through filtering as a crucial determinant of year-to-year pathogen transmission and emphasize the importance of host ecology and heterogeneity for disease dynamics.

TI The effect of mating system on growth of Arabidopsis lyrata in response
   to inoculation with the biotrophic parasite Albugo candida
AB The effects of variation in host reproductive systems on response to pathogens are not well understood. We inoculated individuals from outcrossing and inbreeding populations of North American Arabidopsis lyrata with Albugo candida (white blister rust) to test the effect of mating system and heterozygosity on disease response. We observed three host infection phenotypes, classified as fully resistant, partially resistant and fully susceptible. Overall, inbreeding populations had more susceptible and fewer partially resistant individuals than outcrossing populations, but the highest proportion of resistant individuals was found in two of the inbreeding populations. Mating system did not affect relative growth rate of inoculated plants, but there were strong effects of population and infection phenotype. We conclude that mating system per se does not determine the resistance of natural A. lyrata populations to infection by Albugo, but that the increased variability in responses among inbreeding populations may be due to reduced effective population size.

TI Evolution of Migration in a Periodically Changing Environment
AB The ability to migrate can evolve in response to various forces. In particular, when selection is heterogeneous in space but constant in time, local adaptation induces a fitness cost on immigrants and selects against migration. The evolutionary outcome, however, is less clear when selection also varies temporally. Here, we present a two-locus model analyzing the effects of spatial and temporal variability in selection on the evolution of migration. The first locus is under temporally varying selection (various periodic functions are considered, but a general nonparametric framework is used), and the second locus is a modifier controlling migration ability. First, we study the dynamics of local adaptation and derive the migration rate that maximizes local adaptation as a function of the speed and geometry of the fluctuations in the environment. Second, we derive an analytical expression for the evolutionarily stable migration rate. When there is no cost of migration, we show that higher migration rates are favored when selection changes fast. When migration is costly, however, the evolutionarily stable migration rate is maximal for an intermediate speed of the variation of selection. This model may help in understanding the evolution of migration in a broad range of scenarios and, in particular, in host-parasite systems, where selection is thought to vary quickly in both space and time.

TI Defensive endosymbionts: a cryptic trophic level in community ecology
AB P>Maternally transmitted endosymbionts are widespread among insects, but how they are maintained within host populations is largely unknown. Recent discoveries show that some endosymbionts protect their hosts from pathogens or parasites. Spiroplasma, an endosymbiont of Drosophila neotestacea, protects female hosts from the sterilizing effects of parasitism by the nematode Howardula aoronymphium. Here, we show that Spiroplasma spreads rapidly within experimental populations of D. neotestacea subject to Howardula parasitism, but is neither strongly favored nor selected against in the absence of Howardula. In a reciprocal experiment, Howardula declined steadily to extinction in populations of Spiroplasma-infected flies, whereas in populations of uninfected flies, the prevalence of Howardula parasitism increased to c. 100%. Thus, Spiroplasma and Howardula exhibit effectively consumer-resource trophic dynamics. The recent spread of Spiroplasma in natural populations of D. neotestacea coincides with a decline in the prevalence of Howardula parasitism in the wild.

TI Divergent resistance to a monogenean flatworm among three-spined
   stickleback populations
AB P>1. Given their ubiquity, we might expect parasites to play an important role in the adaptive divergence of host populations. Specifically, adaptation to local parasite communities is predicted to influence the evolution of a number of host traits such as parasite resistance.
   2. To investigate the possibility that divergent parasite-mediated selection drives population-level variation in parasite resistance, we artificially infected lab-reared three-spined sticklebacks with the monogenean flatworm Gyrodactylus gasterostei. The fish were derived from five populations from North Uist, Scotland, that were chosen because they differed in natural infection levels of Gyrodactylus arcuatus.
   3. We found substantial differences in resistance to G. gasterostei among populations. Resistance was defined largely by the ability to limit the size of the worm population rather than by the timing of the host response.
   4. Experimental resistance was not significantly correlated with natural infection levels of G. arcuatus. However, in general, populations with greater exposure to G. arcuatus were shown to be more resistant to G. gasterostei. Fish from the only naturally unexposed population showed the highest susceptibility, which may be the result of less selection to maintain resistance.
   5. Taken together, these results suggest that the divergent selection mediated by Gyrodactylus may play a role in driving population-level variation in resistance to this parasite.

TI Honeybees and bumblebees share similar bacterial symbionts
AB Associations with symbiotic microorganisms are a major source for evolutionary innovation in eukaryotes. Arthropods have long served as model systems to study such associations, especially since Paul Buchner's (1965) seminal work that beautifully illustrated the enormous diversity of microorganisms associated with insects. Particularly high taxonomic and functional diversities of microbial symbionts have been found in the guts and gut-associated organs of insects. These microorganisms play important roles in the digestion, nutrition and defence of the host. However, most studies of gut microorganisms have focused on single host taxa, limiting the ability to draw general conclusions on composition and functional roles of the insect gut microbiota. This is especially true for the diverse and important insect order Hymenoptera that comprises the bees, wasps and ants. Recently, Russell et al. (2009) analysed the bacterial community associated with diverse ant species and found evidence for changes in the microbial gut community coinciding with the evolution of herbivory. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Martinson et al. (2011) provide the first broad-scale bacterial survey for bees. Their findings substantiate earlier evidence for a surprisingly simple gut microbiota in honeybees (Apis mellifera) that is composed of only six to ten major phylotypes. Importantly, Martinson et al. demonstrate for the first time that the same bacterial phylotypes are major constituents of other Apis as well as Bombus species, but not of any other bees and wasps outside of the corbiculate bees, a clade of four tribes within the subfamily Apinae. These results indicate that corbiculate bees harbour a specific and possibly co-evolved bacterial community in their digestive tract. Furthermore, the comparison with other bees and wasps suggests that changes in social lifestyle may have had a stronger effect on the evolution of the gut microbiota than the dietary shift from predatory ancestors to pollen-feeding (i.e. herbivorous) species. These findings have far-reaching implications for research on the microbial symbionts of insects as well as on the nutritional physiology of the ecologically and economically important group of corbiculate bees.

TI Phylogeography and Taxonomy of Trypanosoma brucei
AB Background: Characterizing the evolutionary relationships and population structure of parasites can provide important insights into the epidemiology of human disease.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined 142 isolates of Trypanosoma brucei from all over sub-Saharan Africa using three distinct classes of genetic markers (kinetoplast CO1 sequence, nuclear SRA gene sequence, eight nuclear microsatellites) to clarify the evolutionary history of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr) and T. b. gambiense (Tbg), the causative agents of human African trypanosomosis (sleeping sickness) in sub-Saharan Africa, and to examine the relationship between Tbr and the non-human infective parasite T. b. brucei (Tbb) in eastern and southern Africa. A Bayesian phylogeny and haplotype network based on CO1 sequences confirmed the taxonomic distinctness of Tbg group 1. Limited diversity combined with a wide geographical distribution suggested that this parasite has recently and rapidly colonized hosts across its current range. The more virulent Tbg group 2 exhibited diverse origins and was more closely allied with Tbb based on COI sequence and microsatellite genotypes. Four of five COI haplotypes obtained from Tbr were shared with isolates of Tbb, suggesting a close relationship between these taxa. Bayesian clustering of microsatellite genotypes confirmed this relationship and indicated that Tbr and Tbb isolates were often more closely related to each other than they were to other members of the same subspecies. Among isolates of Tbr for which data were available, we detected just two variants of the SRA gene responsible for human infectivity. These variants exhibited distinct geographical ranges, except in Tanzania, where both types co-occurred. Here, isolates possessing distinct SRA types were associated with identical COI haplotypes, but divergent microsatellite signatures.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our data provide strong evidence that Tbr is only a phenotypic variant of Tbb; while relevant from a medical perspective, Tbr is not a reproductively isolated taxon. The wide distribution of the SRA gene across diverse trypanosome genetic backgrounds suggests that a large amount of genetic diversity is potentially available with which human-infective trypanosomes may respond to selective forces such as those exerted by drugs.

   Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a cross-sectional serological and entomological study to evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of T. cruzi transmission in a peri-rural region of La Joya, Peru. We use a multivariate catalytic model and Bayesian methods to estimate incidence of infection over time and thereby elucidate the complex history of transmission in the area. Of 1,333 study participants, 101 (7.6%; 95% CI: 6.2-9.0%) were confirmed T. cruzi seropositive. Spatial clustering of parasitic infection was found in vector insects, but not in human cases. Expanded catalytic models suggest that transmission was interrupted in the study area in 1996 (95% credible interval: 1991-2000), with a resultant decline in the average annual incidence of infection from 0.9% (95% credible interval: 0.6-1.3%) to 0.1% (95% credible interval: 0.005-0.3%). Through a search of archival newspaper reports, we uncovered documentation of a 1995 vector control campaign, and thereby independently validated the model estimates.
   Conclusions/Significance: High levels of T. cruzi transmission had been ongoing in peri-rural La Joya prior to interruption of parasite transmission through a little-documented vector control campaign in 1995. Despite the efficacy of the 1995 control campaign, T. cruzi was rapidly reemerging in vector populations in La Joya, emphasizing the need for continuing surveillance and control at the rural-urban interface.

TI Identification of Small Molecule Lead Compounds for Visceral
   Leishmaniasis Using a Novel Ex Vivo Splenic Explant Model System
AB Background: New drugs are needed to treat visceral leishmaniasis (VL) because the current therapies are toxic, expensive, and parasite resistance may weaken drug efficacy. We established a novel ex vivo splenic explant culture system from hamsters infected with luciferase-transfected Leishmania donovani to screen chemical compounds for anti-leishmanial activity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: This model has advantages over in vitro systems in that it: 1) includes the whole cellular population involved in the host-parasite interaction; 2) is initiated at a stage of infection when the immunosuppressive mechanisms that lead to progressive VL are evident; 3) involves the intracellular form of Leishmania; 4) supports parasite replication that can be easily quantified by detection of parasite-expressed luciferase; 5) is adaptable to a high-throughput screening format; and 6) can be used to identify compounds that have both direct and indirect anti-parasitic activity. The assay showed excellent discrimination between positive (amphotericin B) and negative (vehicle) controls with a Z' Factor >0.8. A duplicate screen of 4 chemical libraries containing 4,035 compounds identified 202 hits (5.0%) with a Z score of < -1.96 (p<0.05). Eighty-four (2.1%) of the hits were classified as lead compounds based on the in vitro therapeutic index (ratio of the compound concentration causing 50% cytotoxicity in the HepG(2) cell line to the concentration that caused 50% reduction in the parasite load). Sixty-nine (82%) of the lead compounds were previously unknown to have anti-leishmanial activity. The most frequently identified lead compounds were classified as quinoline-containing compounds (14%), alkaloids (10%), aromatics (11%), terpenes (8%), phenothiazines (7%) and furans (5%).
   Conclusions/Significance: The ex vivo splenic explant model provides a powerful approach to identify new compounds active against L. donovani within the pathophysiologic environment of the infected spleen. Further in vivo evaluation and chemical optimization of these lead compounds may generate new candidates for preclinical studies of treatment for VL.

TI Using Parasitic Trematode Larvae to Quantify an Elusive Vertebrate Host
AB Digenean trematode parasites require multiple host species to complete their life cycles, and their abundance can often be strongly correlated with the abundance of their host species. Species richness and abundance of parasites in easily sampled host species may yield an accurate estimate of the species richness and abundance of other hosts in a parasite's life cycle that are difficult to survey directly. Accordingly, we investigated whether prevalence and mean abundance of trematodes could be used to estimate the abundance of one of their host species, diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin), which are difficult to sample and are designated as near threatened (by the International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN Red List]) along some U.S. coasts. As an adult the trematode Pleurogonius malaclemys is specific to terrapins. Its larval stages live first inside mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta) and are subsequently shed into the environment where they form external metacercarial cysts on hard surfaces such as snail opercula. The life cycle of P. malaclemys is completed when terrapins ingest these cysts. At 12 sites along the coast of Georgia (U.S.A.), we determined the prevalence of internal P. malaclemys larvae in mud snails (proportion of infected snails in a population) and the prevalence and mean abundance of external trematode cysts. We examined whether these data were correlated with terrapin abundance, which we estimated with mark-recapture methods. The abundance of external cysts and salinity explained >= 59% of the variability in terrapin abundance. We suggest that dependent linkages between the life stages of multihost parasites make them reliable predictors of host species' abundance, including hosts with abundances that are challenging to quantify directly.

TI Monarch butterfly migration and parasite transmission in eastern North
   America
AB Seasonal migration occurs in many animal systems and is likely to influence interactions between animals and their parasites. Here, we focus on monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and a protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha) to investigate how host migration affects infectious disease processes. Previous work showed that parasite prevalence was lower among migratory than nonmigratory monarch populations; two explanations for this pattern are that (1) migration allows animals to periodically escape contaminated habitats (i.e., migratory escape), and (2) long-distance migration weeds out infected animals (i.e., migratory culling). We combined field-sampling and analysis of citizen science data to examine spatiotemporal trends of parasite prevalence and evaluate evidence for these two mechanisms. Analysis of within-breeding-season variation in eastern North America showed that parasite prevalence increased from early to late in the breeding season, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory escape. Prevalence was also positively related to monarch breeding activity, as indexed by larval density. Among adult monarchs captured at different points along the east coast fall migratory flyway, parasite prevalence declined as monarchs progressed southward, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory culling. Parasite prevalence was also lower among monarchs sampled at two overwintering sites in Mexico than among monarchs sampled during the summer breeding period. Collectively, these results indicate that seasonal migration can affect parasite transmission in wild animal populations, with implications for predicting disease risks for species with threatened migrations.

TI Spread of Plague Among Black-Tailed Prairie Dogs Is Associated With
   Colony Spatial Characteristics
AB Sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis) is an exotic pathogen that is highly virulent in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and causes widespread colony losses and individual mortality rates >95%. We investigated colony spatial characteristics that may influence inter-colony transmission of plague at 3 prairie dog colony complexes in the Great Plains. The 4 spatial characteristics we considered include: colony size, Euclidean distance to nearest neighboring colony, colony proximity index, and distance to nearest drainage (dispersal) corridor. We used multi-state mark-recapture models to determine the relationship between these colony characteristics and probability of plague transmission among prairie dog colonies. Annual mapping of colonies and mark-recapture analyses of disease dynamics in natural colonies led to 4 main results: 1) plague outbreaks exhibited high spatial and temporal variation, 2) the site of initiation of epizootic plague may have substantially influenced the subsequent inter-colony spread of plague, 3) the long-term effect of plague on individual colonies differed among sites because of how individuals and colonies were distributed, and 4) colony spatial characteristics were related to the probability of infection at all sites although the relative importance and direction of relationships varied among sites. Our findings suggest that conventional prairie dog conservation management strategies, including promoting large, highly connected colonies, may need to be altered in the presence of plague.

TI How the insect immune system interacts with an obligate symbiotic
   bacterium
AB The animal immune system provides defence against microbial infection, and the evolution of certain animal-microbial symbioses is predicted to involve adaptive changes in the host immune system to accommodate the microbial partner. For example, the reduced humoral immune system in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, including an apparently non-functional immune deficiency (IMD) signalling pathway and absence of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), has been suggested to be an adaptation for the symbiosis with the bacterium Buchnera aphidicola. To investigate this hypothesis, the interaction between Buchnera and non-host cells, specifically cultured Drosophila S2 cells, was investigated. Microarray analysis of the gene expression pattern in S2 cells indicated that Buchnera triggered an immune response, including upregulated expression of genes for antimicrobial peptides via the IMD pathway with the PGRP-LC as receptor. Buchnera cells were readily taken up by S2 cells, but were subsequently eliminated over 1-2 days. These data suggest that Buchnera induces in non-host cells a defensive immune response that is deficient in its host. They support the proposed contribution of the Buchnera symbiosis to the evolution of the apparently reduced immune function in the aphid host.

TI Vibrio parahaemolyticus Infection Induces Modulation of IL-8 Secretion
   Through Dual Pathway via VP1680 in Caco-2 Cells
AB Background. Vibrio parahaemolyticus causes acute gastroenteritis and inflammations in humans. A variety of pathogenic bacteria can stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in host cells. Phosphorylation of MAPKs leads to production of interleukin (IL)-8 and subsequently causes inflammations. Thus, MAPK cascades were strong candidates for the main signaling pathway of V. parahaemolyticus-induced acute inflammation
   Methods. To determine whether the signaling pathway on V. parahaemolyticus infection induces inflammation, we analyzed the secretion level of IL-8 and phosphorylation of MAPKs by use of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells.
   Results. V. parahaemolyticus infection of Caco-2 cells activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 MAPK signal pathways, leading to IL-8 secretion, whereas MAPK inhibitors, UO126 or SB203580, suppressed IL-8 secretion. A strain carrying a deletion of VP1680, a type three secretion system 1 (T3SS1) effector protein, failed to activate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK and secretion of IL-8. ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor, UO126, failed IL-8 promoter activity, whereas p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, decreased the stabilization of IL-8 messenger RNA following V. parahaemolyticus infection.
   Conclusions. We showed that V. parahaemolyticus infection of Caco-2 cells results in the secretion of IL-8, and that VP1680 plays a pivotal role in manipulating host cell signaling and is responsible for triggering IL-8 secretion.

TI Is parasite pressure a driver of chemical cue diversity in ants?
AB Parasites and pathogens are possibly key evolutionary forces driving recognition systems. However, empirical evidence remains sparse. The ubiquitous pioneering ant Formica fusca is exploited by numerous socially parasitic ant species. We compared the chemical cue diversity, egg and nest mate recognition abilities in two Finnish and two UK populations where parasite pressure is high or absent, respectively. Finnish populations had excellent egg and nest mate discrimination abilities, which were lost in the UK populations. The loss of discrimination behaviour correlates with a loss in key recognition compounds (C-25-dimethylalkanes). This was not owing to genetic drift or different ecotypes since neutral gene diversity was the same in both countries. Furthermore, it is known that the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of non-host ant species remain stable between Finland and the UK. The most parsimonious explanation for the striking difference in the cue diversity (number of C-25-dimethylalkanes isomers) between the UK and Finland populations is the large differences in parasite pressure experienced by F. fusca in the two countries. These results have strong parallels with bird (cuckoo) studies and support the hypothesis that parasites are driving recognition cue diversity.

   Encephalitis Virus Seroconversion in Pigs and Humans
AB The effect of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITMNs) on Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus seroconversion in pigs and humans was studied in Assam, Northeast India. A sharp reduction of seroconversion rate in human and pig was found in treated localities after intervention. A marked reduction was achieved in humans (risk ratio [RR] = 0.28. 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16-0.49) and pigs (RR = 0.21, CI = 0.11-0.40) in the Kollolua locality where ITMNs were used on both humans and pigs compared with the other two area, Athabari and Rajmai, where ITMNs were covering only either humans or pigs. Monitoring of the mosquito population in and around cattle sheds during dusk revealed no significant decline (P > 0.05) of vector density during the post-intervention period in study localities. In spite of the high preponderance of potential JE vector outdoors during the post-intervention period, an encouraging line of defense against circulation of JE virus through the use of ITMNs can be achieved in endemic areas.

TI Making Contact: Rooting Out the Potential for Exposure of Commercial
   Production Swine Facilities to Feral Swine in North Carolina
AB Despite North Carolina's long history with feral swine, populations were low or absent in eastern counties until the 1990s. Feral swine populations have since grown in these counties which also contain a high density of commercial production swine (CPS) facilities. Sixteen of the highest swine producing U.S. counties also populated with feral swine are in North Carolina. Disconcertingly, since 2009, positive tests for exposure to swine brucellosis or pseudorabies virus have been found for feral swine. We surveyed 120 CSP facilities across four eastern counties to document the level and perception of feral swine activity around CSP facilities and to identify disease transmission potential to commercial stock. Nearly all facility operators (97%) recognized feral swine were in their counties. Far fewer said they had feral swine activity nearby (18%). Our inspections found higher presence than perceived with feral swine sign at 19% of facilities where operators said they had never observed feral swine or their sign. Nearly 90% expressed concern about feral to domestic disease transmission, yet only two facilities had grain bins or feeders fenced against wildlife access. Due to increasing feral swine populations, recent evidence of disease in feral populations, the importance of swine production to North Carolina's economy and the national pork industry, and potential for feral-domestic contact, we believe feral swine pose an increasing disease transmission threat warranting a stringent look at biosecurity and feral swine management at North Carolina CPS facilities.

TI Use of Molecular Epidemiology to Trace Transmission Pathways for
   Infectious Salmon Anaemia Virus (ISAV) in Norwegian Salmon Farming
AB Background: Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA) is a disease affecting farmed Atlantic salmon, and most salmon producing countries have experienced ISA outbreaks. The aim of the present study was to use epidemiological and viral sequence information to trace transmission pathways for ISA virus (ISAV) in Norwegian salmon farming.
   Methods: The study covers a period from January 2007 to July 2009 with a relatively high rate of ISA outbreaks, including a large cluster of outbreaks that emerged in Northern Norway (the North-cluster). Farms with ISA outbreaks and neighbouring salmon farms (At-risk-sites) were tested for the presence of ISAV, and epidemiological information was collected. ISAV hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and fusion (F) protein genes were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Associations between sequence similarities and salmon population data were analysed to substantiate possible transmission pathways.
   Results: There was a high degree of genetic similarity between ISAV isolates within the North-cluster. ISAV was detected in 12 of 28 At-risk-sites, and a high proportion of the viruses were identified as putative low virulent genotypes harbouring the full length highly polymorphic region (HPR); HPR0 of the HE protein and the amino acid glutamine (Q) in the F protein at position 266. The sequences from HPR0/F (Q(266)) genotypes revealed larger genetic variation, lower viral loads and lower prevalence of infection than HPR-deleted genotypes. Seaway distance between salmon farms was the only robust explanatory variable to explain genetic similarity between ISAV isolates.
   Discussion: We suggest that a single HPR-deleted genotype of ISAV has spread between salmon farms in the North-cluster. Furthermore, we find that HPR0/F (Q(266)) genotypes are frequently present in farmed populations of Atlantic salmon. From this, we anticipate a population dynamics of ISAV portrayed by low virulent genotypes occasionally transitioning into virulent genotypes, causing solitary outbreaks or local epidemics through local transmission.

TI Household size is critical to varicella-zoster virus transmission in the
   tropics despite lower viral infectivity
AB The epidemiology and severity of infections can vary dramatically in different geographical regions. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a particularly tractable model for investigating such global differences, since infections can be unambiguously identified. VZV is spread by aerosol to cause chickenpox, which, in temperate countries, is a relatively benign childhood infection; yet in tropical countries it tends to occur at later age, a trend associated with markedly increased severity including complications, hospitalization, and overall burden of care.
   To investigate global differences in the epidemiology of chickenpox we studied a population in Guinea Bissau, which in contrast to other tropical countries has an unexpectedly early age of infection with VZV, comparable to temperate latitudes. In this study we used detailed records from over 3000 houses during an outbreak of chickenpox, combined with viral genetic information on routes of infection, to obtain precise estimates of disease transmission within and between houses. This community contains many large households in which different families live under a single roof, in living quarters divided by partitions. Our data show that household infectivity in tropical Guinea Bissau is reduced four-fold compared with temperate climates (14.8% versus 61-85%), with an intermediate rate between members of the same family who are in more intimate contact (23.5%). All else being equal, these lower infection rates would be expected to lead to a later age of infection as is commonly seen in other tropical countries. The young age of infection, which had drawn our attention to the Guinea Bissau population, can however be explained by the exceptionally large household sizes (mean 14.5 people).
   We have combined genetic and demographic data to show that the epidemiology of chickenpox in tropical Guinea Bissau is dependent on the interaction of the social and physical environments. The distinctive clinical presentation of VZV and its ubiquitous distribution make it an attractive model for estimating the variables that contribute to global differences in the transmission of airborne viruses.

TI MALADAPTATION IN WILD POPULATIONS OF THE GENERALIST PLANT PATHOGEN
   PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE
AB Multihost pathogens occur widely on both natural and agriculturally managed hosts. Despite the importance of such generalists, evolutionary studies of host-pathogen interactions have largely focused on tightly coupled interactions between species pairs. We characterized resistance in a collection of Arabidopsis thaliana hosts, including 24 accessions collected from the Midwest USA and 24 from around the world, and patterns of virulence in a collection of Pseudomonas syringae strains, including 24 strains collected from wild Midwest populations of A. thaliana (residents) and 18 from an array of cultivated species (nonresidents). All of the nonresident strains and half of the resident strains elicited a resistance response on one or more A. thaliana accessions. The resident strains that failed to elicit any resistance response possessed an alternative type III secretion system (T3SS) that is unable to deliver effectors into plant host cells; as a result, these seemingly nonpathogenic strains are incapable of engaging in gene for gene interactions with A. thaliana. The remaining resident strains triggered greater resistance compared to nonresident strains, consistent with maladaptation of the resident bacterial population. We weigh the plausibility of two explanations: general maladaptation of pathogen strains and a more novel hypothesis whereby community level epidemiological dynamics result in adaptive dynamics favoring ephemeral hosts like A. thaliana.

TI SUPERINFECTION DRIVES VIRULENCE EVOLUTION IN EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS OF
   BACTERIA AND PLASMIDS
AB A prominent hypothesis proposes that pathogen virulence evolves in large part due to a trade-off between infectiousness and damage to hosts. Other explanations emphasize how virulence evolves in response to competition among pathogens within hosts. Given the proliferation of theoretical possibilities, what best predicts how virulence evolves in real biological systems? Here, I show that virulence evolution in experimental populations of bacteria and self-transmissible plasmids is best explained by within-host competition. Plasmids evolved to severely reduce the fitness of their hosts even in the absence of uninfected cells. This result is inconsistent with the trade-off hypothesis, which predicts that under these conditions vertically transmitted pathogens would evolve to be less virulent. Plasmid virulence was strongly correlated with the ability to superinfect cells containing competing plasmid genotypes, suggesting a key role for within-host competition. When virulent genotypes became common, hosts evolved resistance to plasmid infection. These results show that the trade-off hypothesis can incorrectly predict virulence evolution when within-host interactions are neglected. They also show that symbioses between bacteria and plasmids can evolve to be surprisingly antagonistic.

TI Pathogenesis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy-Revisited
AB Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that is rare even though the proven etiological agent of PML, the polyomavirus JC (JC virus), is ubiquitous within the human population. The common feature of PML cases appears to be underlying immunosuppression, and PML has gained clinical visibility because of its association with human immunodeficiency virus and AIDS and its occurrence as a side effect of certain immunomodulatory drugs. A hypothesis has gained general acceptance that JC virus causes a primary infection in childhood and enters a latent state, after which immunosuppression allows viral reactivation leading to PML. Nonetheless, many important aspects of PML pathogenesis remain unclear, including the molecular bases of latency and reactivation, the site(s) of latency, the relationship of archetype and prototype virus and the mode of virus transmission within the body and between individuals. In this review, we will revisit these areas and examine what the available evidence suggests.

AB Methods. Participants were 1383 children and 1477 adults from a population-based sample in a rural community in Uganda. Serum samples were tested for HHV-8 antibodies with use of an enzyme immunoassay against K8.1.
   Results. HHV-8 seroprevalence increased from 16% among children aged 1.5-2 years to 32% among children aged 10-13 years (P <.001) and from 37% among participants aged 14-19 years to 49% among adults aged >= 50 years (P <.05). HHV-8 seropositivity in children was independently associated with residing with a seropositive parent (P < .001) and residing with >= 1 other seropositive child aged < 14 years (P < .001). History of sharing food and/or sauce plates was marginally associated with HHV-8 infection in children (P = .05). Among 1404 participants aged >= 15 years , there was no association between correlates of sexual behavior (eg, number of lifetime sex partners and HIV infection) and HHV-8 seropositivity (P > .10).
   Conclusions. Our data suggest that HHV-8 is acquired primarily through horizontal transmission in childhood from intrafamilial contacts and that transmission continues into adulthood potentially through nonsexual routes.

TI Wild immunology
AB In wild populations, individuals are regularly exposed to a wide range of pathogens. In this context, organisms must elicit and regulate effective immune responses to protect their health while avoiding immunopathology. However, most of our knowledge about the function and dynamics of immune responses comes from laboratory studies performed on inbred mice in highly controlled environments with limited exposure to infection. Natural populations, on the other hand, exhibit wide genetic and environmental diversity. We argue that now is the time for immunology to be taken into the wild. The goal of 'wild immunology' is to link immune phenotype with host fitness in natural environments. To achieve this requires relevant measures of immune responsiveness that are both applicable to the host-parasite interaction under study and robustly associated with measures of host and parasite fitness. Bringing immunology to nonmodel organisms and linking that knowledge host fitness, and ultimately population dynamics, will face difficult challenges, both technical (lack of reagents and annotated genomes) and statistical (variation among individuals and populations). However, the affordability of new genomic technologies will help immunologists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists work together to translate and test our current knowledge of immune mechanisms in natural systems. From this approach, ecologists will gain new insight into mechanisms relevant to host health and fitness, while immunologists will be given a measure of the real-world health impacts of the immune factors they study. Thus, wild immunology can be the missing link between laboratory-based immunology and human, wildlife and domesticated animal health.

The falling costs of whole-genome sequencing using next-generation technologies now mean that it is realistic to use this as a tool to study this rapid microbial evolution both in the laboratory and in the wild. Such experiments are being used to accurately estimate the rates of mutation, reveal the genetic targets and dynamics of natural selection, uncover the correlation (or lack thereof) between genetic and phenotypic change, and provide data to test long-standing evolutionary hypotheses. These advances have important implications for our understanding of the within- and between-host evolution of microbial pathogens.

TI Mining the plant-herbivore interface with a leafmining Drosophila of
   Arabidopsis
AB Experimental infections of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) with genomically characterized plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae have facilitated the dissection of canonical eukaryotic defence pathways and parasite virulence factors. Plants are also attacked by herbivorous insects, and the development of an ecologically relevant genetic model herbivore that feeds on Arabidopsis will enable the parallel dissection of host defence and reciprocal resistance pathways such as those involved in xenobiotic metabolism. An ideal candidate is Scaptomyza flava, a drosophilid fly whose leafmining larvae are true herbivores that can be found in nature feeding on Arabidopsis and other crucifers. Here, we describe the life cycle of S. flava on Arabidopsis and use multiple approaches to characterize the response of Arabidopsis to S. flava attack. Oviposition choice tests and growth performance assays on different Arabidopsis ecotypes, defence-related mutants, and hormone and chitin-treated plants revealed significant differences in host preference and variation in larval performance across Arabidopsis accessions. The jasmonate and glucosinolate pathways in Arabidopsis are important in mediating quantitative resistance against S. flava, and priming with jasmonate or chitin resulted in increased resistance. Expression of xenobiotic detoxification genes was reduced in S. flava larvae reared on Arabidopsis jasmonate signalling mutants and increased in plants pretreated with chitin. These results and future research directions are discussed in the context of developing a genetic model system to analyse insect-plant interactions.

TI AFLP genome scan in the black rat (Rattus rattus) from Madagascar:
   detecting genetic markers undergoing plague-mediated selection
AB The black rat (Rattus rattus) is the main reservoir of plague (Yersinia pestis infection) in Madagascar's rural zones. Black rats are highly resistant to plague within the plague focus (central highland), whereas they are susceptible where the disease is absent (low altitude zone). To better understand plague wildlife circulation and host evolution in response to a highly virulent pathogen, we attempted to determine genetic markers associated with plague resistance in this species. To this purpose, we combined a population genomics approach and an association study, both performed on 249 AFLP markers, in Malagasy R. rattus. Simulated distributions of genetic differentiation were compared to observed data in four independent pairs, each consisting of one population from the plague focus and one from the plague-free zone. We found 22 loci (9% of 249) with higher differentiation in at least two independent population pairs or with combining P-values over the four pairs significant. Among the 22 outlier loci, 16 presented significant association with plague zone (plague focus vs. plague-free zone). Population genetic structure inferred from outlier loci was structured by plague zone, whereas the neutral loci dataset revealed structure by geography (eastern vs. western populations). A phenotype association study revealed that two of the 22 loci were significantly associated with differentiation between dying and surviving rats following experimental plague challenge. The 22 outlier loci identified in this study may undergo plague selective pressure either directly or more probably indirectly due to hitchhiking with selected loci.

TI Nonspecific patterns of vector, host and avian malaria parasite
   associations in a central African rainforest
AB Malaria parasites use vertebrate hosts for asexual multiplication and Culicidae mosquitoes for sexual and asexual development, yet the literature on avian malaria remains biased towards examining the asexual stages of the life cycle in birds. To fully understand parasite evolution and mechanism of malaria transmission, knowledge of all three components of the vector-host-parasite system is essential. Little is known about avian parasite-vector associations in African rainforests where numerous species of birds are infected with avian haemosporidians of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus. Here we applied high resolution melt qPCR-based techniques and nested PCR to examine the occurrence and diversity of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences of haemosporidian parasites in wild-caught mosquitoes sampled across 12 sites in Cameroon. In all, 3134 mosquitoes representing 27 species were screened. Mosquitoes belonging to four genera (Aedes, Coquillettidia, Culex and Mansonia) were infected with twenty-two parasite lineages (18 Plasmodium spp. and 4 Haemoproteus spp.). Presence of Plasmodium sporozoites in salivary glands of Coquillettidia aurites further established these mosquitoes as likely vectors. Occurrence of parasite lineages differed significantly among genera, as well as their probability of being infected with malaria across species and sites. Approximately one-third of these lineages were previously detected in other avian host species from the region, indicating that vertebrate host sharing is a common feature and that avian Plasmodium spp. vector breadth does not always accompany vertebrate-host breadth. This study suggests extensive invertebrate host shifts in mosquito-parasite interactions and that avian Plasmodium species are most likely not tightly coevolved with vector species.

TI Molecular epidemiology of malaria prevalence and parasitaemia in a wild
   bird population
AB Avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.) and other blood parasitic infections of birds constitute increasingly popular model systems in ecological and evolutionary host-parasite studies. Field studies of these parasites commonly use two traits in hypothesis testing: infection status (or prevalence at the population level) and parasitaemia, yet the causes of variation in these traits remain poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative PCR to investigate fine-scale environmental and host predictors of malaria infection status and parasitaemia in a large 4-year data set from a well-characterized population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). We also examine the temporal dynamics of both traits within individuals. Both infection status and parasitaemia showed marked temporal and spatial variation within this population. However, spatiotemporal patterns of prevalence and parasitaemia were non-parallel, suggesting that different biological processes underpin variation in these two traits at this scale. Infection probability and parasitaemia both increased with host age, and parasitaemia was higher in individuals investing more in reproduction (those with larger clutch sizes). Several local environmental characteristics predicted parasitaemia, including food availability, altitude, and distance from the woodland edge. Although infection status and parasitaemia were somewhat repeatable within individuals, infections were clearly dynamic: patent infections frequently disappeared from the bloodstream, with up to 26% being lost between years, and parasitaemia also fluctuated within individuals across years in a pattern that mirrored annual population-level changes. Overall, these findings highlight the ecological complexity of avian malaria infections in natural populations, while providing valuable insight into the fundamental biology of this system that will increase its utility as a model host-parasite system.

TI A Bayesian Approach to Analyse Genetic Variation within RNA Viral
   Populations
AB The development of modern and affordable sequencing technologies has allowed the study of viral populations to an unprecedented depth. This is of particular interest for the study of within-host RNA viral populations, where variation due to error-prone polymerases can lead to immune escape, antiviral resistance and adaptation to new host species. Methods to sequence RNA virus genomes include reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RT-PCR is a molecular biology technique widely used to amplify DNA from an RNA template. The method itself relies on the in vitro synthesis of copy DNA from RNA followed by multiple cycles of DNA amplification. However, this method introduces artefactual errors that can act as confounding factors when the sequence data are analysed. Although there are a growing number of published studies exploring the intra-and inter-host evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses, the complexity of the methods used to generate sequences makes it difficult to produce probabilistic statements about the likely sources of observed sequence variants. This complexity is further compounded as both the depth of sequencing and the length of the genome segment of interest increase. Here we develop a Bayesian method to characterise and differentiate between likely structures for the background viral population. This approach can then be used to identify nucleotide sites that show evidence of change in the within-host viral population structure, either over time or relative to a reference sequence ( e. g. an inoculum or another source of infection), or both, without having to build complex evolutionary models. Identification of these sites can help to inform the design of more focussed experiments using molecular biology tools, such as site-directed mutagenesis, to assess the function of specific amino acids. We illustrate the method by applying to datasets from experimental transmission of equine influenza, and a pre-clinical vaccine trial for HIV-1.

TI Autonomous Targeting of Infectious Superspreaders Using Engineered
   Transmissible Therapies
AB Infectious disease treatments, both pharmaceutical and vaccine, face three universal challenges: the difficulty of targeting treatments to high-risk 'superspreader' populations who drive the great majority of disease spread, behavioral barriers in the host population (such as poor compliance and risk disinhibition), and the evolution of pathogen resistance. Here, we describe a proposed intervention that would overcome these challenges by capitalizing upon Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs) that are engineered to replicate conditionally in the presence of the pathogen and spread between individuals - analogous to 'transmissible immunization' that occurs with live-attenuated vaccines (but without the potential for reversion to virulence). Building on analyses of HIV field data from sub-Saharan Africa, we construct a multiscale model, beginning at the single-cell level, to predict the effect of TIPs on individual patient viral loads and ultimately population-level disease prevalence. Our results show that a TIP, engineered with properties based on a recent HIV gene-therapy trial, could stably lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by, similar to 30-fold within 50 years and could complement current therapies. In contrast, optimistic antiretroviral therapy or vaccination campaigns alone could only lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by, <2-fold over 50 years. The TIP's efficacy arises from its exploitation of the same risk factors as the pathogen, allowing it to autonomously penetrate superspreader populations, maintain efficacy despite behavioral disinhibition, and limit viral resistance. While demonstrated here for HIV, the TIP concept could apply broadly to many viral infectious diseases and would represent a new paradigm for disease control, away from pathogen eradication but toward robust disease suppression.

TI Reconciliation of Genome-Scale Metabolic Reconstructions for Comparative
   Systems Analysis
AB In the past decade, over 50 genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have been built for a variety of single- and multi-cellular organisms. These reconstructions have enabled a host of computational methods to be leveraged for systems-analysis of metabolism, leading to greater understanding of observed phenotypes. These methods have been sparsely applied to comparisons between multiple organisms, however, due mainly to the existence of differences between reconstructions that are inherited from the respective reconstruction processes of the organisms to be compared. To circumvent this obstacle, we developed a novel process, termed metabolic network reconciliation, whereby non-biological differences are removed from genome-scale reconstructions while keeping the reconstructions as true as possible to the underlying biological data on which they are based. This process was applied to two organisms of great importance to disease and biotechnological applications, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida, respectively. The result is a pair of revised genome-scale reconstructions for these organisms that can be analyzed at a systems level with confidence that differences are indicative of true biological differences (to the degree that is currently known), rather than artifacts of the reconstruction process. The reconstructions were re-validated with various experimental data after reconciliation. With the reconciled and validated reconstructions, we performed a genome-wide comparison of metabolic flexibility between P. aeruginosa and P. putida that generated significant new insight into the underlying biology of these important organisms. Through this work, we provide a novel methodology for reconciling models, present new genome-scale reconstructions of P. aeruginosa and P. putida that can be directly compared at a network level, and perform a network-wide comparison of the two species. These reconstructions provide fresh insights into the metabolic similarities and differences between these important Pseudomonads, and pave the way towards full comparative analysis of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of multiple species.

TI Enzymatic Shaving of the Tegument Surface of Live Schistosomes for
   Proteomic Analysis: A Rational Approach to Select Vaccine Candidates
AB Background: The membrane-associated and membrane-spanning constituents of the Schistosoma mansoni tegument surface, the parasite's principal interface with the host bloodstream, have recently been characterized using proteomic techniques. Biotinylation of live worms using membrane-impermeant probes revealed that only a small subset of the proteins was accessible to the reagents. Their position within the multilayered architecture of the surface has not been ascertained.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: An enzymatic shaving approach on live worms has now been used to release the most accessible components, for analysis by MS/MS. Treatment with trypsin, or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PiPLC), only minimally impaired membrane integrity. PiPLC-enriched proteins were distinguished from those released in parasite vomitus or by handling damage, using isobaric tagging. Trypsin released five membrane proteins, Sm200, Sm25 and three annexins, plus host CD44 and the complement factors C3 and C4. Nutrient transporters and ion channels were absent from the trypsin fraction, suggesting a deeper location in the surface complex; surprisingly, two BAR-domain containing proteins were released. Seven parasite and two host proteins were enriched by PiPLC treatment, the vaccine candidate Sm29 being the most prominent along with two orthologues of human CD59, potentially inhibitors of complement fixation. The enzymes carbonic anhydrase and APD-ribosyl cyclase were also enriched, plus Sm200 and alkaline phosphatase. Host GPI-anchored proteins CD48 and CD90, suggest 'surface painting' during worm peregrination in the portal system.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that the membranocalyx secreted over the tegument surface is not the inert barrier previously proposed, some tegument proteins being externally accessible to enzymes and thus potentially located within it. Furthermore, the detection of C3 and C4 indicates that the complement cascade is initiated, while two CD59 orthologues suggest a potential mechanism for its inhibition. The detection of several host proteins is a testimonial to the acquisitive properties of the tegument surface. The exposed parasite proteins could represent novel vaccine candidates for combating this neglected disease.

TI Trypanosoma cruzi in the Chicken Model: Chagas-Like Heart Disease in the
   Absence of Parasitism
AB Background: The administration of anti-trypanosome nitroderivatives curtails Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Chagas disease patients, but does not prevent destructive lesions in the heart. This observation suggests that an effective treatment for the disease requires understanding its pathogenesis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To understand the origin of clinical manifestations of the heart disease we used a chicken model system in which infection can be initiated in the egg, but parasite persistence is precluded. T. cruzi inoculation into the air chamber of embryonated chicken eggs generated chicks that retained only the parasite mitochondrial kinetoplast DNA minicircle in their genome after eight days of gestation. Crossbreeding showed that minicircles were transferred vertically via the germ line to chicken progeny. Minicircle integration in coding regions was shown by targeted-primer thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, and detected by direct genomic analysis. The kDNA-mutated chickens died with arrhythmias, shortness of breath, cyanosis and heart failure. These chickens with cardiomyopathy had rupture of the dystrophin and other genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation. Tissue pathology revealed inflammatory dilated cardiomegaly whereby immune system mononuclear cells lyse parasite-free target heart fibers. The heart cell destruction implicated a thymus-dependent, autoimmune; self-tissue rejection carried out by CD45(+), CD8 gamma delta(+), and CD8 alpha lymphocytes.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that genetic alterations resulting from kDNA integration in the host genome lead to autoimmune-mediated destruction of heart tissue in the absence of T. cruzi parasites.

TI Antagonistic coevolution limits population persistence of a virus in a
   thermally deteriorating environment
AB P>Understanding the conditions under which rapid evolutionary adaptation can prevent population extinction in deteriorating environments (i.e. evolutionary rescue) is a crucial aim in the face of global climate change. Despite a rapidly growing body of work in this area, little attention has been paid to the importance of interspecific coevolutionary interactions. Antagonistic coevolution commonly observed between hosts and parasites is likely to retard evolutionary rescue because it often reduces population sizes, and results in the evolution of costly host defence and parasite counter-defence. We used experimental populations of a bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and a bacteriophage virus (SBW25 Theta 2), to study how host-parasite coevolution impacts viral population persistence in the face of gradually increasing temperature, an environmental stress for the virus but not the bacterium. The virus persisted much longer when it evolved in the presence of an evolutionarily constant host genotype (i.e. in the absence of coevolution) than when the bacterium and virus coevolved. Further experiments suggest that both a reduction in population size and costly infectivity strategies contributed to viral extinction as a result of coevolution. The results highlight the importance of interspecific evolutionary interactions for the evolutionary responses of populations to global climate change.

TI Prevalence of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus infections in
   HIV-positive Chinese patients
AB To evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in HIV-infected patients in China, an epidemiological serosurvey was conducted from May 2007 to September 2008 using a random cluster sampling design of infectious disease hospitals in seven high HIV-prevalent provinces (municipalities). Univariate analysis and logistic regression were used to study the determinants of HIV and HBV and/or HCV co-infection. The overall prevalence was 41.83% (95% CI 40.36-43.30) for anti-HCV and 12.49% (95% CI 11.50-13.48) for HBsAg, respectively. The prevalence of anti-HCV and H BsAg varied according to the route of HIV transmission. Compared to those with sexually acquired HIV infection, intravenous drug users and blood donors/recipients had the greatest risk of carrying anti-HCV. Needle sharing and unprotected sexual exposures are important modes of transmission for HBV. Further interventions including health education and harm reduction strategies should be implemented in high-risk populations.

TI Hantavirus outbreak in Western Europe: reservoir host infection dynamics
   related to human disease patterns
AB Within Europe, Puumala virus (PUUV) is the causal agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans, a zoonotic disease with increasing significance in recent years. In a region of Belgium with a historically high incidence of NE, bank voles (the PUUV reservoir hosts), were monitored for PUUV IgG antibody prevalence in nine study sites before, during, and after the highest NE outbreak recorded in Belgium in 2005. We found that the highest numbers of PUUV IgG-positive voles coincided with the peak of NE cases at the regional level, indicating that a PUUV epizootic in bank voles directly led to the NE outbreak in humans. On a local scale, PUUV infection in voles was patchy and not correlated to NE incidence before the epizootic. However, during the epizootic period PUUV infection spread in the vole populations and was significantly correlated to local NE incidence. Initially, local bank-vole numbers were positively associated with local PUUV infection risk in voles, but this was no longer the case after the homogeneous spreading of PUUV during the PUUV outbreak.

TI Vertebrate host protective immunity drives genetic diversity and
   antigenic polymorphism in Schistosoma mansoni
AB Schistosomes are gonochoric blood parasites with a complex life cycle responsible for a disease of considerable medical and veterinary importance in tropical and subtropical regions. Understanding the evolution of schistosome genetic diversity is clearly of fundamental importance to interpreting schistosomiasis epidemiology and disease transmission patterns of this parasite. In this article, we investigated the putative role of the host immune system in the selection of male genetic diversity. We demonstrated the link between genetic dissimilarity and the protective effect among male worms. We then compared the proteomes of three male clones with different genotypes and differing by their capacity to protect against reinfection. The identified differences correspond mainly to antigens known or supposed to be involved in the induction of protective immunity. These results underline the role played by host immune system in the selection of schistosome genetic diversity that is linked to antigenic diversity. We discuss the evolutionary consequences in the context of schistosome infection.
